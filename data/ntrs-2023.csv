successfully flown beyond flutter using active feedback control methods. This report discusses the flight-test methods used during envelope expansion and presents the data collected. The frequency and damping of rigid-body flight dynamic modes and the first two structural modes were estimated from the flight data. The flutter mechanism (body freedom flutter) was found to match predictions with coupling occurring between the short period and the first symmetric wing bending mode. Flights up to the instability threshold and beyond were conducted using active feedback control. Several tests were conducted in flight where the control system was disabled momentarily to observe the unstable flutter mode and then reengaged; thus, demonstrating active suppression."

Technology Readiness Levels provide a standardized assessment of a technology’s maturity and enable consistent comparison among technologies. They inform decisions throughout a technology’s development life cycle, from concept, through development, to use. A variety of alternative Readiness Levels have been developed, including Algorithm Readiness Levels,  manufacturing Readiness Levels, Human Readiness Levels, Commercialization Readiness Levels, Machine Learning Readiness Levels, and Technology Commitment Levels. However, while Technology Readiness Levels have been increasingly applied to emerging disciplines, there are unique challenges to assessing the rapidly developing capabilities of autonomy. This paper adopts the moniker of Space Trusted Autonomy Readiness Levels to identify a two-dimensional scale of readiness and trust appropriate for the special challenges of assessing autonomy technologies that seek space use. It draws inspiration from other readiness levels’ definitions, and from the rich field of trust and trustworthiness. The Space Trusted Autonomy Readiness Levels were developed by a collaborative Space Trusted Autonomy subgroup, which was created from The Space Science and Technology Partnership Forum between the United States Space Force, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Reconnaissance Office."

This paper summarizes measurements conducted during US and Russian/Soviet landed missions as well as experiments performed on returned samples to establish fundamental geotechnical properties such as particle size distribution, particle shape, bulk density, shear strength, cohesion and bearing strength.  While many of these properties are well known, how they vary with increased lunar soil depth is less understood, and those properties that vary significantly as a function of depth are explored in additional detail.  Selected examples discuss mechanical excavation forces, rocket exhaust erosion forces, and the preparation of launch/landing pad surfaces, with the goal of a better understanding of lunar soil geotechnical properties that apply to large-scale exploration of the lunar surface and dictate the design of future exploration systems."

These include proprotor systems capable of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), axial forward flight, and the intermediate transition phases of vehicle flight. The aerodynamic loading requirements as well as resulting acoustics during these different phases of flight can vary considerably. An optimization effort was undertaken with the objective of minimizing radiated tonal acoustics of a proprotor system for both static hover and axial forward flight conditions, while simultaneously preserving aerodynamic performance relative to a baseline propeller design."
4,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220015670,2023-08-03,Establishing Standardized Test Methods for Evaluating Space Suit Gloves,"The Artemis space suit glove environmental protection garment (EPG) will be the first line of protection used to protect the crewmember’s hands from the environments encountered during extravehicular activity (EVA). As the Artemis missions will include more extreme environments, it is necessary to define tests to evaluate if gloves can meet new, challenging requirements. The NASA  Engineering  and  Safety  Center  (NESC)has funded  an  effort with the goal  to  help vendors to produce a space suit glove that is sufficiently durable to meet the needs of the Artemis missions. Three problems were identified in meeting that goal. First, there are no standardized tests defined to evaluate the durability of space suit gloves for the extreme lunar environments. Second, there is insufficient data on glove performance in a lunar environment from which to compare new designs. And third, current ISS glove TMG fabrics are unlikely to be sufficient to meet Lunar requirements. Four tasks were established to answer different aspects of these three problems. Task 1 focused on the characterization of potential glove fabrics using ASTM standardized test methods when possible. When one did not exist, new standardized test procedures were devised.  Task 2 focused on developing a procedure for characterizing the thermal performance of a glove assembly.  Task 3 focused on devising a standard procedure for characterizing the dust/abrasion resistance of a space suit glove. Task 4 focused on devising a standard procedure for characterizing the cut resistance of a space suit glove while at cryogenic temperatures. The new procedures created in Tasks 2, 3 and 4 were then validated by testing the Phase VI glove to collect baseline data. This paper will summarize the approach used to establish standardized test methods for each task and will expound on the ASTM process to publish the new standards."

Semicrystalline thermoplastics such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyether ketone ketone (PEKK), and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) have been successfully demonstrated as thermoplastic skins, keel beams, and angle brackets for commercial aircraft.

Composite specimens were fabricated from the Toray TC1225 and TC1200 unidirectional prepreg systems and tested to gain confidence with NASA in-house TPC processing as part of the Thermoplastics Development for Exploration Application (TDEA) project. TC1225 is a relatively new material system that uses T700GC fibers and low-melt polyaryl ether ketone (LM-PAEK) resin. TC1200 is the latest version of a material system that has been available for several decades with AS4 fibers and PEEK resin. Results for ultrasonic inspection, optical microscopy, acid digestion, and differential scanning calorimetry establish the quality of the panels. Mechanical test data for unnotched and notched laminate tension and compression as well as compression after impact provide data for equivalency assessment and support material selection in TDEA. Satisfactory equivalence of the TC1225 results and the National Center for Advanced Materials Performance (NCAMP) database was found. The results indicate high-quality manufacturing was achieved, and the resulting mechanical test data are in agreement with that in the literature."

Data collected within the Remote Operations for Autonomous Missions (ROAM) Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Operations Center will be used to explore different roles and responsibilities of remote operators managing multiple autonomous vehicles, with the goal of exploring human-autonomy teaming concepts that enable m:N operations (i.e., m operators managing N vehicles). ROAM has developed into a world-class research, development, and technology (RD&T) environment that can support both the collection of human factors data and the command and control of remote vehicles in beyond visual line of sight conditions. Presented in this paper is an overview of ROAM, with a focus on the design components that support human factors data collection and a review of initial usability results of the facility."

The study is aimed at reduced drag and enhanced lift over the range of practical angles of attack, including stall. These benefits translate to airplane performance improvements, such as longer range or larger payload. Various flow control techniques were explored using Computational Fluid Dynamics and the aerodynamic performance enhancements were benchmarked against the baseline configuration. The computational analyses are used to quantify aerodynamic benefits, as well as the input required for actuation. The results were used in a system integration study for identifying potential practical implementations, which are described in a companion paper. Combined with the integration analysis, the objective of this project is to identify the most promising flow control candidates that potentially provide material net airplane level enhancements using onboard fluidic sources. The current study indicates that up to 5% net improvement in L/D at takeoff is potentially achievable using active flow control on the aileron, after accounting for factors of system integration."

10,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017033,2023-08-03,Developing a Hybrid Space Suit Simulator as a Research Tool for Assessing Extravehicular Activity Relevant Workload,"Suited testing time is limited and hard to come by, expensive, and requires a whole team to operate and monitor the suit; however, pressurized spacesuits are not always necessary for initial developmental efforts or assessment of informatics. The Human Physiology, Performance, Protection & Operations Laboratory (H-3PO) at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) is developing a Hybrid Space Suit Simulator (HS3) to support characterization of human performance during planetary surface exploration analogs. The primary goal of HS3 is to create a low cost, modular, and unpressurized suit simulator for use as a research tool which provides relevant physical and cognitive workload approximations with EVA-like immersion during planetary extravehicular activity (EVA) simulations. HS3 consists of a soft suit, communication, thermal control, gloves, boots, helmet, and integrated bioinformatics/sensors. The modular design of HS3 allows it to be modified to support test objectives as needed. HS3 enables H-3PO and NASA to complete critical human health and performance testing to address open risks and knowledge gaps in a timely, repeatable, and controlled manner.  

Four engineering runs were completed with HS3 as a baseline for capability. General workload was assessed while traversing on a passive treadmill and conducting geology tasks. Liquid cooling temperature, suit temperature, and metabolic rates were collected during one extended three-hour engineering run. For the duration of the engineering run the suit temperature was 26.6 ± 1.58 °C while suit humidity was 53.7 ± 5.11 %. Helmet temperature was higher than suit temperature at 27.8 ± 1.58 °C. Helmet humidity was lower than average suit humidity at 50.12 ± 11.3 °C. The liquid cooling temperature remained stable at 22.4 ± 1.62 °C. Resting metabolic rate was 597 ± 88 BTU/hr while metabolic rate increased during traverse tasks at 1500 ± 319 BTU/hr and geology tasks at 921 ± 129 BTU/hr. Following the engineering runs, a characterization study will be conducted. The subjects will perform EVA-like scenarios in both a shirtsleeve only and donned HS3, consisting of EVA task circuit focused on traversing, geological rock sampling, and task board manipulation. The characterization study will provide data capability for implementing HS3 in analog EVA testing environments."
11,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017084,2023-08-03,Passive Rocket Diffuser Testing: Reacting Flow Performance of Advanced Configurations,"Upper stage rocket engines are optimized for operation at the edge of space. Ground testing often requires simulation of high-altitude environments to prevent damage from off-design operation. Passive supersonic diffusers are an effective means of establishing the partial vacuum needed around the nozzle exit. The low cost of diffusers relative to active vacuum sources (ejectors, pumps, etc.) provides a perpetual incentive to improve their performance and expand the envelope of passively testable engines. Second-throat diffusers have been the de facto standard for rocket testing since the 1950s, and numerous studies have focused on parametric optimization of the topology. Yet, even the best second-throat designs may require more driving pressure than an upper stage engine can provide. To overcome conventional limits, engineers at NASA’s Stennis Space Center (SSC) adapted an obscure cold-flow diffuser topology to the extremes of immersion in supersonic combustion products. Aerodynamic experimentation was conducted at SSC’s E-3 test stand to quantify the performance of prototypical hot-fire spike diffuser hardware and enable direct comparison to prior states of the art. 

A LO<sub>X</sub>/GH<sub>2</sub> thruster was contoured to approximate the regeneratively-cooled nozzle of an upper-stage engine and fired into 28 downstream diffuser configurations: 16 second-throat, 2 centerbody, and 10 spike. Temperature and pressure were recorded along the test article walls for a range of chamber pressures spanning 3.5 - 5.0 MPa. The second-throat configurations with the lowest start and unstart pressure ratios were shown to outperform equivalent systems in literature and taken as baselines for evaluation of advanced diffuser performance. Compared to these exemplars, centerbody diffusers decreased start pressure ratio by 11% but increased unstart pressure ratio by 15%. Spike diffusers reduced start and unstart pressure ratios by 24% and 9%, respectively."

A 50-kW class electric propulsion system is envisioned to transit a massive vehicle be-tween a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) parking orbit and a lunar L2 southern Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO). A parameterization is developed by which the Lunar Transit can be analyzed in the context of varying vehicle mass, solar elec-tric propulsion (SEP) configurations, and solar array power output. A rapid and novel mission analysis tool enables a wide array of these trade analyses to be completed without the need for extensive computing resources or time. This tool is shown to be useful in the analysis of a reference trajectory, where changes to the baseline vehicle architecture or off-nominal operational scenarios (such as electric thruster failures) can be rapidly assessed by the mission designer."
13,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017148,2023-08-03,Exploration Extra-Vehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) Composite Hard Upper Torso (CHUT) Development,"The xEMU is the Exploration Mobility Unity or space suit designed for microgravity (cislunar and low earth orbit (LEO)) and lunar surface operations. This suit design allows crewmembers to perform extravehicular exploration, science, construction, maintenance, and contingency operations while unattached to a vehicle for life support in pressure and thermal environments that exceed human capability. The xEMU provides life support, environmental protection, and communications capabilities to the EVA crewmember while allowing sufficient mobility and visibility to perform dexterous EVA tasks. The effort documented in this paper, addressed the design, analysis, manufacturing, full-scale test article testing and validation for a Composite Hard Upper Torso(CHUT)unit. Design and analysis of the CHUT was based on measured B-basis properties of the selected S-glass/epoxy composite, and established final geometry, composite layup and interface details that met requirements. A complete manufacturing and assembly protocol was established for the CHUT starting from composite layup in the tool, to final assembly of all interface metal hardware prior to delivery to NASA for suit integration. Full-scale CHUT test articles underwent static and fatigue pressure testing (2 lifetimes), impact testing at critical stress locations for tool drop/microgravity scenarios, followed by post-impact fatigue testing. Effect of manufacturing defects was evaluated by manufacturing a full-scale CHUT with 0.375”/0.5” defects at critical stress locations, followed by static and life-cycle fatigue testing. In all cases, the CHUT design met or exceeded mass, structural, interface and functional requirements. Two (2) complete CHUT articles were delivered to NASA for full-scale suit integration and testing."

This paper will present and discuss the results of a recent experiment with the juncture-flow model in the NASA Langley 14- by 22-Foot Subsonic Tunnel.  The main objective of that test was to expand the existing juncture-flow dataset with a symmetric wing case that displays fully attached, incipient separation, and separated flow in the corner of the wing-fuselage junction, depending on the model pitch angle.  Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements were made at three model pitch angles (0 deg: fully attached, 1 deg: incipient separation, and 5 deg: separated flow) and for each one, mean-flow and Reynolds-stress data was obtained on the fuselage and at several streamwise locations along the corner of the wing-fuselage junction. Supporting measurements were made during the test campaign and included model and tunnel wall static pressures, tunnel wall and ceiling boundary-layer rake data, oil-flow visualizations, and laser-based measurements of the as-built model geometry and model position in the test section.  Comparisons between the experimental data and Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes CFD results will also be presented and discussed."

- This paper and presentation summarizes the concept definition, studies, and analysis results generated by the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), ISS Program (ISSP), and Mission Operations Directorate for implementing DDO during mated Orbiter/ISS missions. [1]
- Due to the ever-increasing visiting vehicle traffic to and from the ISS, it became apparent to both the ISSP and the SSP that there would arise occasions where conflicts between a visiting vehicle docking and/or undocking could overlap with a planned Space Shuttle launch and/or during mated Orbiter/ISS operations.
- This potential conflict provided the genesis for evaluating risk mitigations to gain maximum flexibility for managing potential visiting vehicle traffic to and from the ISS and to maximize launch and landing opportunities for all visiting vehicles.
- Reviews were conducted to assess the viability and readiness of the SSP to protect for DDO on any given mission and it was found to be t echnically feasible"
17,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017492,2023-08-03,Measurements and Computations of Natural Transition on the NASA Juncture-Flow Model with a Symmetric Wing,"Experiments were performed in the 14- by 22-Foot Subsonic Tunnel to assess natural transition on the symmetric-airfoil wings of the NASA Juncture-Flow Model. Infrared thermography was used to visualize the heating on the upper surface of both wings of the full-span model, and on the fuselage, for angles of incidence ranging from -10° to 10° at a fixed Reynolds number of 2.4E6 based on the chord length at the wing planform break. The fuselage boundary layer transitioned well upstream of the wing-root leading edge for all conditions. Transition fronts were identified by a steep rise in the surface temperature, and the transition coordinates were transformed from an image-based to a body-fixed system. Additionally, the state of the boundary layer was estimated at pressure ports distributed on the wings through observation of the pressure coefficient as a function of the angle of incidence. For increasing angles of incidence, the transition front was observed to advance upstream, in a mostly spanwise-uniform fashion, from near midchord at α = 0°; however, for increasingly negative angles of incidence, the transition front first receded and then advanced in a nonuniform jagged manner that is typically observed with stationary crossflow. The transition wedges first appeared inboard of the wing break and then spread outboard to near the tip by α = -6°. The upstream shift in transition at positive angles of incidence and the outboard progression of crossflow-dominated transition at increasingly negative angles of incidence are consistent with trends identified in a computational assessment of the boundary-layer transition based on both linear stability analysis and Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes-based transition models. The stability results obtained from the Langley Stability and Transition Analysis Code were used to recalibrate a dual N-factor criterion, which allowed for the prediction of transition fronts that showed excellent agreement with the experiment. The Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes-based models, from the NASA OVERFLOW 2.3 solver, that accounted for the crossflow instability showed mixed results in comparison with the experiment, with the helicity-based Langtry-Menter model performing the best. The experimental data, particularly the cases involving strong influence from both Tollmien-Schlichting and crossflow instabilities, will be valuable for the continued validation and improvement of transition models."
18,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017885,2023-08-03,Exploration Medical Capability Clinical Decision Support Use Cases for CDSS Test Bed,"Long-duration, deep-space exploration missions present significant challenges to crew health and performance. These challenges include the individual and combined effects of microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation, limited resources (mass, volume, power, data, and crew time), limited options for evacuation, and those associated with delayed or constrained communications. Each of these challenges necessitates greater degrees of crew autonomy as our distance from Earth increases. Specifically, as communication delays intensify - and evacuation capability diminishes the further we explore space - the unqualified need for Earth-independent medical operations focused on autonomous diagnosis, treatment and prevention will become key to mission continuation and success. This need will be especially true should a crewmember become ill or injured wherein treatment and disposition “in-situ” ultimately falls to the crew itself to determine. 

To augment the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) of a time-constrained exploration mission crew operating under stressful conditions, combatting fatigue, and facing a potential medical crisis, a robust clinical decision support system (CDSS) is a probable solution. A CDSS would facilitate, guide, and inform Earth-independent medical operations while assisting crewmembers through various clinical presentations. The CDSS would allow crewmembers to take advantage of pre-mission training tied to the in-flight/in-mission use of pre-planned protocols that offer both a range of diagnostic options and “just-in-time” (refamiliarization) training and assistance. CDSS will expand such capabilities by improving the utility and effectiveness of various available diagnostic, treatment, and health maintenance tools, techniques, and measures."
19,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220018221,2023-08-03,Strategic Deconfliction of Small Unmanned Aircraft Using Operational Volume Blocks at Crossing Waypoints,"In this research, first, analytical case studies are performed to understand the parameters on which the minimum temporal separation between unmanned aircraft at crossing waypoints is dependent for enabling strategic deconfliction. The analytical expressions show that the minimum temporal separation is a function of the length and width of operational volume blocks, the relative positions of the active operational volume blocks, groundspeed of unmanned aircraft, and the incoming crossing angle. Next, the parametric study shows that the impact of the incoming crossing angle on the minimum temporal separation at a crossing waypoint increases with an increase in the width of the operational volume blocks. Finally, simulation studies are performed to understand the impact of operational volume block sizing, on-demand departure rate, minimum departure time separation, and the incoming crossing angle on the average ground delay of unmanned aircraft traveling on two routes with a single crossing waypoint and identical on-demand departure rate. Each unmanned aircraft’s estimated time of arrival at a crossing waypoint is adjusted by introducing a ground delay in departure time; no other controls (e.g., speed adjustments) are applied for strategic deconfliction. Simulation studies show that the impact of the minimum temporal separation at a crossing waypoint on the average ground delay of flights is negligible if the minimum departure time separation is at least two times the minimum temporal separation. Therefore, with an increase in minimum departure time separation at a depot, the impact of increased length of operational volume blocks enclosing the crossing waypoint on the ground delay is offset to an extent."

This architecture includes the use of the Gateway space station positioned in this orbit. While the proximity operations in the NRHO are similar to field-free space dynamics, the far-field rendezvous aspect of the problem is more complicated. We analyze the key drivers of the ΔV performance of the far-field rendezvous problem from low lunar orbit to the Gateway. We find that lunar latitudinal libration is a driving factor to ΔV performance for surface ascent missions that rendezvous with the NRHO, and that transfer time from low lunar orbit to NRHO affects more aspects of the geometry and performance than expected from rendezvous in Keplerian orbits."

We quantify the performance of this Cloud Detection Neural Network (CDNN) using human-labeled validation data where we report a 96% accuracy in detecting clouds in testing datasets for both Zenith- viewing and Forward-viewing models. We assess our performance by comparing the flight-averaged cloud fraction of zenith and forward CDNN retrievals, with that of the prototype hyperspectral total-diffuse Sunshine Pyranometer (SPN-S) instrument’s cloud optical depth data. Comparison of the CDNN with the SPN-S on time specific intervals resulted in 93% accuracy for the zenith- viewing CDNN and 84% for the forward- viewing CDNN. The comparison of the CDNNs with the SPN-S on flight-averaged cloud fraction resulted in an agreement of 0.15 for the Forward CDNN and 0.07 for the Zenith CDNN. We then quantify the ability of the CDNN to identify the presence of clouds above the aircraft using a forward- looking camera mounted inside the aircraft cockpit compared to the use of an All- Sky upward-looking camera that is mounted outside the fuselage on top of the aircraft.

Aerodynamic results at the Reynolds number of 1.8 million show good comparison with the experimental measurements at different angles of attack from pre-stall to post-stall regimes. The pressure plateaus caused by the flow separation and the recovery of pressure inside the separation bubble around the iced leading edge are well predicted with the scale-resolving simulations when sufficient grid resolution is used around the accreted ice. The unsteadiness of the turbulent flows around the iced airfoil is also examined through the turbulent kinetic energy with the Reynolds normal stress anisotropy. Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) arises at the shear layer triggered by the upper ice horn and leads to rapid laminar-to-turbulent transition over a large range of angle of attack. With the increase of the angle of attack, the region with high turbulence intensity induced by the unstable shear layer spreads quickly over the entire upper surface of the airfoil. The coherent KHI modes from the upper and lower ice horns are extracted using the spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) technique. The SPOD modes extracted from the upper shear layer have large-scale variations in the spanwise direction and low-rank behavior where the energy of the leading SPOD mode at each Strouhal number of the KHI largely represents the total energy when the mode number in the spanwise direction is small."

A second order accurate, non-dissipative finite volume discretization is used to systematically investigate the effects of different polyhedral Voronoi mesh types using a sequence of three canonical problems with increasing complexity. First, inviscid isentropic vortex propagation is studied to demonstrate the substantial reduction of errors for rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedral cell types over Cartesian hexagonal cells of identical spacing. Furthermore, the reduction of errors induced at cell-size transitions (grid-coarsening interfaces) due to Lloyd smoothing iterations is quantified. It is shown that by utilizing an appropriate viscous flux discretization, a constant coefficient subgrid scale model is sufficient for non-linear stability at the 2:1 cell-size transitions on polyhedral grids, although some further error reduction does occur when smoothing is utilized. Next, forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence at an asymptotically large Reynolds number is studied to demonstrate the non-dissipative character of the inviscid flux discretization, and the non-linear robustness and accuracy offered by the viscous flux discretization using a subgrid scale model for all three Voronoi grid types. Finally,Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulations (WMLES) are performed to study the high-lift aerodynamics on the McDonnell Douglas 30P30N multi-element airfoil at two distinct grid levels and for two distinct Voronoi cell types. The formulation is shown to predict the aerodynamic loading with high accuracy at all angles of attack when sufficient resolution is reached, and the hexagonal prism grid topology, while  computationally more expensive, has higher effective resolution compared to the Cartesian grid topology with the same spacing."

The inclusions were completely encapsuled in pyrrhotite, suggesting the fluids were trapped in the early stages of crystal growth, and filled with low-Z material. We performed Time-of Flight-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth profiling and high-resolution mapping at -120°C to exposure and measure the composition of the trapped fluids in a frozen state. These measurements revealed that the ancient, trapped fluids on Ryugu’s parent asteroid were saline aqueous solutions containing H2O, CO2, sulfur species, and nitrogen- and chlorine-bearing organic compounds identified by representative secondary ion species including O(-), OH(-), CO(-), S(-), Cl(-), C2(-), C2H(-), and CN(-). The inferred presence of CO2 indicates formation of the sulfides, and by implication the Ryugu parent body, beyond the H2O and CO2 snow lines of the early solar system, i.e. > 3-4 au from the Sun."

Infrared thermography was used to visualize the heating on the upper surface of both wings of the full-span model, and on the fuselage, for angles of incidence ranging from -10° to 10° at a fixed Reynolds number of 2.4E6 based on the chord length at the wing planform break. The fuselage boundary layer transitioned well upstream of the wing-root leading edge for all conditions. Transition fronts were identified by a steep rise in the surface temperature, and the transition coordinates were transformed from an image-based to a body-fixed system. Additionally, the state of the boundary layer was estimated at pressure ports distributed on the wings through observation of the pressure coefficient as a function of the angle of incidence. For increasing angles of incidence, the transition front was observed to advance upstream, in a mostly spanwise-uniform fashion, from near midchord at α = 0°; however, for increasingly negative angles of incidence, the transition front first receded and then advanced in a nonuniform jagged manner that is typically observed with stationary crossflow. The transition wedges first appeared inboard of the wing break and then spread outboard to near the tip by α = -6°. The upstream shift in transition at positive angles of incidence and the outboard progression of crossflow-dominated transition at increasingly negative angles of incidence are consistent with trends identified in a computational assessment of the boundary-layer transition based on both linear stability analysis and Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes-based transition models. The stability results obtained from the Langley Stability and Transition Analysis Code were used to recalibrate a dual N-factor criterion, which allowed for the prediction of transition fronts that showed excellent agreement with the experiment. The Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes-based models, from the NASA OVERFLOW 2.3 solver, that accounted for the crossflow instability showed mixed results in comparison with the experiment, with the helicity-based Langtry-Menter model performing the best. The experimental data, particularly the cases involving strong influence from both Tollmien-Schlichting and crossflow instabilities, will be valuable for the continued validation and improvement of transition models."

This cycle is intimately linked to the seasonal cycle of the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere, but sea ice processes as well as the exchanges with the atmosphere and ocean may also play a role. To quantify these contributions, a series of idealized sensitivity experiments have been performed with an eddy-permitting (∘) NEMO-LIM3 (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean–Louvain-la-Neuve sea ice model version 3) Southern Ocean configuration, including a representation of ice shelf cavities, in which the model was either driven by an atmospheric reanalysis or coupled to the COSMO-CLM2 regional atmospheric model. In those experiments, sea ice thermodynamics and dynamics as well as the exchanges with the ocean and atmosphere are strongly perturbed. This perturbation is achieved by modifying snow and ice thermal conductivities, the vertical mixing in the ocean top layers, the effect of freshwater uptake and release upon sea ice growth and melt, ice dynamics, and surface albedo. We find that the evolution of sea ice extent during the ice advance season is largely independent of the direct effect of the perturbation and appears thus mainly controlled by initial state in summer and subsequent insolation changes. In contrast, the melting rate varies strongly between the experiments during the retreat, in particular if the surface albedo or sea ice transport are modified, demonstrating a strong contribution of those elements to the evolution of ice coverage through spring and summer. As with the advance phase, the retreat is also influenced by conditions at the beginning of the melt season in September. Atmospheric feedbacks enhance the model winter ice extent response to any of the perturbed processes, and the enhancement is strongest when the albedo is modified. The response of sea ice volume and extent to changes in entrainment of subsurface warm waters to the ocean surface is also greatly amplified by the coupling with the atmosphere."

New control approaches are required to manage the increased interdependency and complexity of these electrified powertrains. Additionally, electrification enables aircraft to have multiple distributed thrust producing fans that the flight control system can leverage for enhanced maneuverability, further increasing the control complexity. This paper describes the control architecture for a concept vehicle with these characteristics, the SUbsonic Single Aft eNgine (SUSAN) Electrofan. SUSAN is a series/parallel partial hybrid electric single-aisle transport aircraft that leverages its electrified powertrain to provide fuel burn and emissions benefits when compared to the state-of-the-art. Achieving these benefits requires an appropriately designed control architecture that coordinates the various powertrain and flight control subsystems. As such, the SUSAN aircraft is designed with a high level of automation, allowing it to properly manage coupled subsystems and react rapidly to failures and anomalies. This paper presents a summary of the SUSAN powertrain design and discusses several of the novel control approaches used to manage the complex electrified powertrain."

However, the maximum fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (Max-FPAR) compositing strategy of the Collection 6 (C6) products dictates that the main or backup algorithm is always triggered by observations of different quality, which indirectly causes the observed instability in the LAI time-series. Based on MODIS daily LAI retrievals, this study develops a prior knowledge time-series compositing algorithm (PKA) using a linear kernel driven (LKD) model. Our results show that the newly proposed PKA can significantly improve the LAI composites compared to the Max-FPAR strategy using ground-based observations for validation. We found that the PKA performs better than Max-FPAR in various aspects (different sites, seasons, and retrieval index (RI) ranges), with R2 increasing from 0.69 to 0.76 and root means square error (RMSE) decreasing from 1.01 to 0.84 compared to GBOV ground truth. The same improvement was shown for the ground truth LAIs measured at the Honghe and Hailun sites in northeastern China, with R2 increasing from 0.23 to 0.41 and RMSE decreasing from 1.27 to 1.25. In addition, three newly proposed temporal uncertainty metrics (time-series stability, TSS and time-series anomaly, TSA and reconstruction error metric, RE (the proximity to the main RT-based retrievals)) were applied to compare the stability of LAI time-series before and after PKA implementation. We found that the time series stability of PKA LAI was improved, the time series anomalies were reduced, and the retrieval rates of the main algorithm were also greatly enhanced compared to Max-FPAR LAI. A case intercomparison for Max-FPAR-MODIS, Max-FPAR-VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite), and PKA-MODIS LAIs in the Amazon Forest region showed that the PKA is also effective in improving the LAI retrieval over large regions with few qualified observations due to poor atmospheric conditions (RE decreased from 2.37/2.35 (Max-FPAR-MODIS/Max-FPAR-VIIRS) to 2.25 (PKA-MODIS) and RI increased from 61.94%/59.62% to 66.88%). The same improvement was seen in the BELMANIP 2.1 sites for almost all biomes except deciduous broadleaf forest, where the RE decreased from 1.85/2.13 to 1.15 overall. We note that the PKA has the potential to be easily implemented in the operational algorithms of subsequent MODIS and MODIS-like LAI Collections."

During the SA, a total of six soil, 48 groundwater direct push technology (DPT), eight groundwater monitoring well, and one surface water sample were collected between October 2021 and March 2022. The samples were analyzed for 28 PFAS compounds using the Department of Defense Quality Systems Manual-compliant Method. SA sample results were used along with historical results to evaluate the extent of PFAS impacts to the environment in the FS1 Area.

These spacesuit systems include the Apollo Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), Space Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) EMU, and Exploration EMU (xEMU). Each spacesuit system is like the other for functionality. However, each spacesuit system is different in configuration based on the technology infused into the system 
associated with the purpose of the mission. Each spacesuit system is made up of many components and the integrate environment targeted for operations leads to an integrated system that is complex. Since Apollo, NASA has invested in multiple technologies that make up these spacesuit systems in different iterations. The Apollo EMU was designed in the 1960’s with a focus to facilitate the first human to walk on the moon. The Space Shuttle EMU was designed in the 1970’s for reusable microgravity operations that began in the early 1980’s. The Space Shuttle EMU was enhanced to facilitate extended operation on the ISS. Over the last 15 years,  NASA has been designing, developing, and testing a new spacesuit system, the xEMU which is considered a design, verification, and test unit. NASA is planning to land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon. NASA recently engaged industry through a new contractual arrangement to provide EVA services needed to return to the Moon and to continue operations on the ISS. Spacesuit systems are complex. Understanding the requirements, operational environment, the necessary technologies, and the integrated spacesuit system are paramount. In addition, understanding the technology infusion process to meet the mission objectives is critical. This paper will review the spacesuit systems for EVA and several component functions within the spacesuits, along with a system comparison of those technologies from Apollo to xEMU."

Evidence from the vast meteorite record [e.g., 1] as well as observations [e.g., 2] strongly suggest that the first planetesimals, and perhaps giant planet core accretion occurred well within the first million years of disk evolution. Moreover, chemical and lithological mixing as well as observations of line-broadening in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) [e.g., 3-6] suggest that the solar system nebula in this epoch was weakly-to-moderately turbulent in the regions where particle growth is of the greatest interest [7-8]. It is a well-known though that global hydrodynamic turbulence complicates particle growth due to a slew of barriers that can slow or even stall particle or aggregate growth at pebble sizes (with corresponding small particle Stokes numbers St) that can lead to loss to the central star via radial drift before planetesimals can ever form [9,10], requiring that some other mechanism come into play that collects growth-frustrated pebbles into gravitationally bound multi-km bodies – objects that are “born big” [11].

The current leading candidate for such a “leap-frog” mechanism is the so-called Streaming Instability (SI), a gas-drag mediated momentum exchange resonance in which the relative velocity between the particle component and a rotating gaseous fluid can lead to high densities in the particle field [12], which has been invoked in a number of recent PPD models that include a turbulent intensity α [e.g., 13-14] as the defacto mechanism for planetesimal formation if conditions for the SI (depending on particle St and the solids-to-gas mass ratio) are satisfied. However, these previous works use conditions established from occurrence studies for the onset of SI in laminar disks [15-17] in which the only source of turbulence is that self-generated by the settling particle layer, and not externally driven global turbulence. Recent analytical theories of the SI subject to global turbulence predict much more stringent conditions for the effectiveness of the SI than the laminar case [18-19]. Thus, whether the efficient operation of the SI can be attained in realistic models of the solar nebula have yet to be established.

In this work, we ask whether the conditions under which the SI can produce gravitationally bound particle overdensities can actually be met in the first million years of evolution in globally turbulent PPDs."

There are several aspects of the lunar surface and its environment which must be accurately modeled before these simulations can be relied upon to influence decisions being made under these programs. Digital Lunar Exploration Sites, a paper submitted to the 2022 IEEE Aerospace Conference, outlined the process used to generate the lunar surface in a digital environment. This paper will expand upon this topic and delve into the steps being taken by the NASA Exploration Systems Simulations (NExSyS) team at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) to properly verify and validate these simulations, with a focus on the visual aspects of the environment.

Natural lighting validation relies in part on the wealth of data generated during the Apollo program. Many images taken by Apollo astronauts on the lunar surface have been replicated in the simulated environments to gain confidence in the accuracy of terrain and lighting models. However, because the environment the Artemis astronauts will experience at the Lunar South Pole (LSP) is dissimilar from the near-equatorial Apollo sites, other validation techniques must be applied. At the LSP, the sun crests only about 1.5 degrees above the horizon and when combined with the lack of a lunar atmosphere, lighting in this region is often very different than what a human would experience on Earth. Solar illumination, earthshine, human eye response, solar blooming, lunar regolith optical properties, and shadows cast by rocks and crater walls will play a significant role in an astronaut’s ability to safely conduct an Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) or perform a traverse with a lunar rover. Approaches for validation of these aspects of the rendered LSP environment are considered in this paper.

In addition to natural lighting, approaches for the validation of artificial lighting models at the LSP are discussed. The JSC Lighting Lab has been studying the illumination profile of the Exploration Informatics Subsystem (xINFO) lighting on the Exploration EVA Mobility Unit (xEMU). How these lights interact with the solar illumination and the shadows being cast on the lunar surface is of particular interest, so the validity of models representing these lights in a human-in-the-loop virtual reality environment becomes very important. This paper also touches on some of the simulation performance considerations when a Human in the Loop (HITL) is present, which drives the need for realtime rendering of the environment.
Natural and artificial lighting will play a crucial role to decisions being made when planning and executing missions at the Lunar South Pole (LSP) and it is vitally important to understand the LSP environment before we return."

While high specific strength 7xxx-series Al alloys are of interest in the aerospace and automotive industries, these alloys suffer from hot cracking issues during fusion welding and AM. In this work, linear deposits of Al 7075 were fabricated with EBF<sup>3</sup> to study the effects of baseplate thickness, preheat temperature, and beam focus on hot cracking behavior. Solidification cracks were observed in the first deposition layer, and by the third layer coalesced into large “macrocracks” running vertically through the build height. Fine, intergranular liquation “microcracks” appeared between macrocracks below the root of the final deposit layer fusion zone. Increasing the substrate preheat temperature from 165°C to 320°C deepened the partially melted zone and resulted in a more than twofold increase in the liquation microcrack density. Analysis of Scheil solidification diagrams revealed that fugitive losses of Zn and Mg during deposition increased the susceptibility to solidification cracking and promoted substrate liquation cracking. Focused electron beam (EB) conditions combined with a high aspect ratio elliptical raster pattern resulted in bands of refined, equiaxed grains. The refined microstructure suppressed solidification macrocracking and caused a nearly fivefold reduction in liquation crack density, demonstrating that beam-induced grain refinement may be a promising low-cost method for reducing hot cracking during AM."

The design task involves sizing the rotorcraft to satisfy specified design conditions and missions. The analysis tasks can include off-design mission performance analysis, flight performance calculation for point operating conditions, and generation of subsystem or component performance maps. Figure 1-1 illustrates the tasks. The principal tasks (sizing, mission analysis, flight performance analysis) are shown in the figure as boxes with heavy borders. Heavy arrows show control of subordinate tasks.

The aircraft description (figure 1-1) consists of all the information, input and derived, that defines the aircraft. The aircraft consists of a set of components, including fuselage, rotors, wings, tails, and propulsion. This information can be the result of the sizing task; can come entirely from input, for a fixed model; or can come from the sizing task in a previous case or previous job. The aircraft description information is available to all tasks and all solutions (indicated by light arrows).

The sizing task determines the dimensions, power, and weight of a rotorcraft that can perform a specified set of design conditions and missions. The aircraft size is characterized by parameters such as design gross weight, weight empty, rotor radius, and engine power available. The relations between dimensions, power, and weight generally require an iterative solution. From the design flight conditions and missions, the task can determine the total engine power or the rotor radius (or both power and radius can be fixed), as well as the design gross weight, maximum takeoff weight, drive system torque limit, and fuel tank capacity. For each propulsion group, the engine power or the rotor radius can be sized.

Missions are defined for the sizing task, and for the mission performance analysis. A mission consists of a number of mission segments, for which time, distance, and fuel burn are evaluated. For the sizing task, certain missions are designated to be used for design gross weight calculations; for transmission sizing; and for fuel tank sizing. The mission parameters include mission takeoff gross weight and useful load. For specified takeoff fuel weight with adjustable segments, the mission time or distance is adjusted so the fuel required for the mission (burned plus reserve) equals the takeoff fuel weight. The mission iteration is on fuel weight or energy.

Flight conditions are specified for the sizing task, and for the flight performance analysis. For the sizing task, certain flight conditions are designated to be used for design gross weight calculations; for transmission sizing; for maximum takeoff weight calculations; and for antitorque or auxiliary thrust rotor sizing. The flight condition parameters include gross weight and useful load.

For flight conditions and mission takeoff, the gross weight can be maximized, such that the power required equals the power available.

A flight state is defined for each mission segment and each flight condition. The aircraft performance can be analyzed for the specified state, or a maximum effort performance can be identified. The maximum effort is specified in terms of a quantity such as best endurance or best range, and a variable such as speed, rate of climb, or altitude. The aircraft must be trimmed, by solving for the controls and motion that produce equilibrium in the specified flight state. Different trim solution definitions are required for various flight states. Evaluating the rotor hub forces may require solution of the blade flap equations of motion."

As a result, star formation studies in the LMC provide a stepping stone to understanding star formation at earlier epochs of the universe where these processes cannot be directly observed. N113 is one of the most prominent star-forming regions in the LMC hosting one of the most massive giant molecular clouds. N113 is small enough to be imaged in its entirety, but large enough to showcase many important phenomena such as multiple generations of stars, stellar feedback, and different environments.

We present our findings from an investigation of the early stages of star formation in the N113 region using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) molecular line data probing a wide density range: 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1), 13CO and C18O (1-0), HCN (1-0), HCO+ (1-0), H13CN (1-0) and (3-2), H13CO+ (1-0) and (3-2), CS (2-1) and (5-4), as well as 1.3 mm and 3 mm continuum. We used the Python package quickclump to identify molecular clumps. We utilized the multiline non-LTE fitting tool based on models from RADEX developed by Finn et al. (2021, ApJ, 917, 106) to construct the CO, HCN, HCO+, and CS temperature and column density, and the H2 density maps of N113. We constructed a catalog of molecular clumps including their physical properties, chemical abundances, sizes, velocities, and velocity dispersions. To establish the evolutionary status of the clumps, their positions were compared with previously identified young stellar objects (YSOs) from the Spitzer/SAGE and Herschel/HERITAGE surveys, as well as water and OH masers. We compared the properties of the clumps in N113 to those in the Galaxy and other regions in the LMC to assess the impact of the environment (e.g., metallicity, stellar feedback) on the star formation process."

These 2017-2018 maps duplicate the footprint from the SAGE-SMC program from 2008 and were obtained at 3.6 and 4.5 μm with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). They provide a nearly 10-year baseline of all observations of the SMC made by Spitzer. We extracted point sources from both the basic calibrated data (BCD) as well as the final processed mosaics. We did not use any prior catalogs as inputs in order to search for moving objects (e.g., foreground brown dwarfs) and other transient phenomena. The extractions from two test fields are shown here: a field sparsely populated with stars and a second containing more complicated structures. Comparing our extractions between both of our epochs and with the SAGE epochs shows the completeness and range of our survey. The mosaics are currently available on the Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) and the Harvard Dataverse. The final point source catalog will be available at both archives, as well.

However, during the spring of 2022, the westerly phase of the tropical quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) descended through the tropics.

It includes the Safety Case used to acquire a BVLOS Certificate of Authorization (COA) from the FAA and is being published to enable others to benefit from this work.
The intended operations, subject to approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), will include a combination of Within Visual Line of Sight (WVLOS) and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) flights, comprising of at most five sUAS operating concurrently, with no more than three operating BVLOS.  Flights will occur in a subset of the Langley Air Force Base (LAFB) Class D airspace (KLFI) at a maximum altitude of 400 ft AGL. Most operations within this subset will take place in the City Environment Range Testing for Autonomous Integrated Navigation (CERTAIN) Range. The CERTAIN Range includes airspace inside the borders of NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC). Additional airspace over the northern section of CERTAIN will be requested as part of the Certificate of Authorization (COA).

NASA LaRC BVLOS operations on the CERTAIN Range can be broken down into five critical components needed to meet the 14 CFR § 91.113 see and avoid requirement: 1) procedural deconfliction with LAFB for UAS operations at or below 400 ft and manned aircraft at or above 900’ AGL; 2) ground equipment for detection of intruder aircraft and to support communications between crewmembers ; 3) sUAS vehicles with advanced onboard automation capable of autonomously maintaining safe separation; 4) BVLOS standardized operating procedures (SOPs); 5) and personnel to execute the flight operations in accordance with the SOPs and respond to airborne contingencies.  
The introduction of new ground equipment includes the use of the Remote Operations for Autonomous Missions (ROAM) UAS Operations Center, development and use of an Integrated Airspace Display (IAD), use of the L-STAR and GA-9120 radars, and the incorporation of standardized Vertiports.  The ROAM Operations Center will be the central point for all BVLOS sUAS operations. All command and control (C2), voice communications and airspace awareness displays will reside inside ROAM. The IAD will provide raw data from ADS-B, FLARM, radar tracks and telemetered GPS vehicle positions for interpretation by an Airspace Monitor. The radars will search the class D airspace around the CERTAIN Range and serve as a backup to procedural deconfliction procedures coordinated with LAFB. In the event of a procedural deconfliction breakdown, radar detections of non-participating aircraft will be available so that the 91.113 see and avoid requirement can still be safely met. Finally, the incorporation of Vertiports will have video and network connectivity that enables large numbers of sUAS launches and recoveries from a single location.
  
This is a continuation of the remote command and control of unpiloted aircraft component focused on evaluating unpiloted aircraft flight crew roles and responsibilities, control interfaces and the associated data links needed to operate a fleet of aircraft within a UAM Ecosystem.

This work supports the development of future aviation operational concepts based on an Urban Air Mobility Maturity Level (UML) 4 environment (Patterson, 2020). It is assumed that future airspace will include hundreds of simultaneous aircraft operations within the airspace, therefore scalable operations are essential for enabling this future airspace to become a reality.  Follow on work includes envisioned flights that expand operations beyond the CERTAIN range and lead to an effective Maritime Surveillance capability."

SWMU 114 includes area around Fire Station #2, Former Sewage Treatment Plant #17, the southern portion of the Shuttle Landing Facility Runway, Remote Launch Vehicle Hangar, and the Towway area. Fire Station #2 was constructed in 2008 and is currently active, housing fire station personnel and equipment, including aqueous film forming foam (AFFF). Releases of AFFF has occurred at SWMU 114. 

Previous environmental assessments have been performed at SWMU 114, including soil, groundwater, and surface water sampling for volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals. No active remediation has been performed at the SWMU 114.

PFAS site assessment field activities were conducted at SWMU 114 from November 2021 through August 2022. During the 2021-2022 Site Assessment, 124 direct-push samples were collected from 27 locations, 17 surface water samples were collected from 15 locations, 41 groundwater samples were collected from 37 newly installed monitoring wells, five concrete samples were collected from four locations, and one asphalt sample was collected. Additionally, two soil borings were advanced to 60 feet for lithologic descriptions, ten staff gauges were installed, and one round of water level measurements were collected from monitoring wells and staff gauges for groundwater flow determination. All groundwater and surface water samples were analyzed for 25 PFAS analytes by USEPA Method 537M. Concrete, and asphalt samples were analyzed by synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) PFAS analysis by USEPA Modified Method 537M.

Groundwater results were compared to the most recent Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) published by USEPA for residential tap water (USEPA, 2022a) to determine the extent of PFAS contamination at SWMU 114 for six PFAS analytes (PFOA, PFNA, PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS, and GenX). Surface water results were compared to the FDEP surface water screening levels (SW SLs) (FDEP, 2020) for PFOA and PFOS. The PFAS investigation concluded that groundwater exceeding RSLs extends east and south to Banana Creek and west to approximately the center of the SLF runway. The extent of PFAS is approximated to the north, to an area between Sharkey Road and Astronaut Road, where samples below the RSLs do not fully bound SWMU 114. At least two distinct PFAS source areas are located near Fire Station #2 and
along Towway, at S114-MW0007S, within SWMU 114. 

Groundwater head measurements indicate that flow at SWMU 114 is generally similar across the shallow and intermediate water tables. A northeast to southwest trending groundwater divide is located near the middle of Towway where groundwater southeast of the divide flows to the south and groundwater northwest of the divide flows to the west. The groundwater divide generally separates the two areas of higher PFAS concentrations.

Surface water samples indicated concentrations of PFOS above the SW SLs in surface water bodies across the site. Further assessment and sampling are required to better understand the interaction between groundwater and surface water at SWMU 114. 

Concrete and asphalt samples collected confirm that a significant release of AFFF occurred near the stormwater pond northwest of Fire Station #2. Additional concrete samples surrounding Fire Station #2 and at the northwest and southeast edges of the SLF tarmac indicate elevated PFOS concentrations. These results indicate that discharges of AFFF in these locations have infiltrated into asphalt and concrete and may act as a continuing source of PFAS to groundwater and surface water after rain events. 

Additional direct-push samples are required to delineate PFAS at SWMU 114. Samples may need to extend beyond the Former SLF Rescue Building and Morpheous Test Site to delineate PFAS in groundwater. Monitoring wells should be sampled and gauged quarterly to determine if seasonal impacts are observable, especially in shallow wells near surface water features. Furthermore, surface water samples should be collected from additional ditches to further define the extent of surface water impacts at SWMU 114 and extending along the SLF runway. Staff gauges should be gauged quarterly with groundwater gauging to determine surface water flow and interaction with groundwater.

The PFAS sampling results and path forward for SWMU 114 were presented to the KSC Remediation Team in October 2022. Once the PFAS SAPR is approved, it will be submitted to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection."

These developments have shaken economic theories of migration and have encouraged interdisciplinary, methodologically mixed, qualitative and quantitative research and analysis. From a review of the literature, we have gleaned 11 common themes about environmental, economic and conflict migration that we differentiate by process (migration behaviours that are still evolving) and patterns (migration behaviours that have become customary). We then consider how positive and negative dimensions of migration can be captured and represented with close attention to livelihood constellations (multiple economic activities combined by individuals, households and families). Finally, focusing on Somalia and agro-pastoral peoples generally, where recent environmental and conflict migration have been added to decades of economic migration and centuries of seasonal, environmental migration associated with pastoralism, we combine historical and qualitative work to demonstrate the value of a livelihood constellation perspective."

Little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. A better understanding of the neural processes during sleep inertia may offer insight into the awakening process. We observed brain activity every 15 min for 1 hr following abrupt awakening from slow wave sleep during the biological night. Using 32-channel electroencephalography, a network science approach, and a within-subject design, we evaluated power, clustering coefficient, and path length across frequency bands under both a control and a polychromatic short-wavelength-enriched light intervention condition. We found that under control conditions, the awakening brain is typified by an immediate reduction in global theta, alpha, and beta power. Simultaneously, we observed a decrease in the clustering coefficient and an increase in path length within the delta band. Exposure to light immediately after awakening ameliorated changes in clustering. Our results suggest that long-range network communication within the brain is crucial to the awakening process and that the brain may prioritize these long-range connections during this transitional state. Our study highlights a novel neurophysiological signature of the awakening brain and provides a potential mechanism by which light improves performance after waking."

Several metal spacecraft cabin ventilation fan prototypes have been designed, built, and tested at the NASA Glenn Research Center Acoustical Testing Laboratory. Tests performed in 2021 of the first prototype of the metal fan measured vibrations greater than desired at design point speed and backpressure conditions. To try to reduce those vibrations, a second prototype of the fan design was developed which included a new lighter rotor with a tighter balance tolerance, a new collet to attach the rotor to the motor shaft more securely and repeatably, and a new bracket to center and hold the motor in the fan centerbody more precisely. The second prototype of the fan was tested in 2023 and the vibrations were measured with the fan operating at design point speeds in isolation but not throttled to design point back pressure conditions since it was not installed with inlet and exhaust ducting. Peak vibration was reduced from 4 mm/s to 1 mm/s. This paper is part of a series of reports documenting the performance of the prototype fan."

In the next decade, the solar and heliospheric community will have to manage the increasing amount of information coming from new missions, improve reanalysis of data from past and current missions, and create new data products from the application of new methodologies. This complex task is further complicated by practical challenges such as different datasets and catalogs in different formats that may require different pre-processing and analysis tools, and the need for numerous analysis approaches that are not all fully optimized for large volumes of data. While several ongoing efforts aim at addressing these problems, the available datasets and tools are not always used to their full potential often due to lack of awareness of available resources.

Furthermore, they are generally excluded categorically from studies which correlate specific molecular properties to cocrystal formation, leaving the prospective ionic cocrystal engineer with few clear avenues to success. Herein ammonium nitrate, an energetic oxidizing salt, is targeted for cocrystallization in a potential coformer group selected based on likely interactions with the nitrate ion as revealed in the Cambridge Structural Database; six novel ionic cocrystals were discovered. Molecular descriptors previously identified as being related to neutral cocrystal formation were examined across the screening group but showed no relationship with ionic cocrystal formation. High packing coefficient is shown to be a constant among the successful coformers in the set and is utilized to directly target two more successful coformers, bypassing the need for a large screening group."

The LBS were replaced in 1993 with new LBSs that do not contain PCBs. The LBS are located on a concrete pad surrounded by grass that is mowed and maintained.

A total of 330 soil samples were collected between June 2020 and December 2022 from 88 locations at depths ranging from 0-0.5 to 19-20 ft bls. In general, soil samples collected from depths less than 5 ft were collected via hand auger and samples collected beyond 5 ft bls were collected using a direct-push technology drill rig. Soil samples collected from greater than 5 ft bls to 20 ft bls were collected to confirm PCBs were not present at depth in the aquifer matrix. Delineation samples were collected using an approximately 20 ft horizontal spacing.

PCB impacted soil has been completely delineated to the State of Florida residential soil cleanup target level (SCTL) at PRL 227a horizontally and vertically. PCB concentrations have been identified above the residential and industrial SCTL as well as concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm requiring coordination with EPA and disposal at a facility authorized under TSCA. Based upon the CSRA sampling, an interim measure is recommended to remove PCB impacted soil above the residential SCTL. The total volume of PCB impacted soil to be removed is 591.6 cubic yards. This includes approximately 9.3 cubic yards of soil with PCB concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm.  An interim measure work plan is included as an attachment to this report."

However, the current transition models used in production CFD codes are insufficient for high-speed flows. Many extensions to low-speed models have been suggested; however, a thorough verification and validation effort is needed before these models can be used in design settings. Challenges include potentially missing details of the model implementation requirements and/or a complete specification of the input parameters needed to replicate the test findings. A meaningful assessment of the generalization capability of these models is also hindered by a lack of information regarding the specific flow configurations and associated grids employed for model calibration. As a key first step toward model verification, we present an independent assessment of two recently proposed models for high-speed transition, namely, a model within the SST-$\gamma$ framework and a model based on the SST-$\gamma-\nu_L$ equations. These models are implemented in the NASA OVERFLOW 2.3e solver and their performance in predicting first mode, second mode, and crossflow transition has been evaluated for several test cases in the supersonic and hypersonic regimes. Besides the test cases employed by the model developers, which could have also been used for model calibration, the present assessment includes supplementary configurations that contribute to an unbiased assessment of the models. The outcomes presented in this study indicate the potential for the models to be applied to high-speed flight configurations.  Key steps toward future improvements to these models are also outlined."

Recognizing the need to quantitatively monitor changes in these recently threatened ecosystems in a timely and cost-effective way, we developed a Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API tool for automated wetland extent mapping using optical and radar satellite sensors that can be applied globally. The tool will significantly improve wetland change analysis and monitoring as SAR data provides high resolution (5-10 m) imagery, unaffected by cloud cover and light availability (day vs. night), common limitations for other remotely sensed sensors. The tool utilizes Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band and NISAR L-band (once operational and available on the GEE repository) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. During image preprocessing, we applied a Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow product to determine regional snow coverage, which affects land classification sensitivity. Calibration and validation were conducted through a historical change and sensitivity analysis of the Sudd wetland located in central Sudan. The tool was the first of its kind, as it enables NISAR data processing through an open-source GEE repository, further expanding and improving the utility of NASA Earth observations and contributing to NASA Open Science initiatives. We anticipate the tool will be used by researchers and practitioners interested in wetland monitoring and management."

The Natural Capital Project’s Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Urban Flood Risk Mitigation (UFRM) model, which benefits from its simplicity and robustness, is commonly used in NASA DEVELOP projects for disaster mitigation, urban planning, and environmental justice issues. While the InVEST UFRM model was able to produce the surface water runoff and retention map sufficient for the scopes of past projects, the model’s accuracy and spatial variability need improvement. Since the current InVEST UFRM model employs constant rainfall depth for all pixels in the area of interest (AOI), the model suffers from inaccurately estimating rainfall depth, runoff volume, and flood depth. Therefore, we adapted the model so that satellite-based precipitation raster datasets (i.e., Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement [GPM IMERG]) can be used instead of a single constant value. We simulated the flood events on August 21st and August 22nd, 2017, in Wyandotte County, Kansas using both our modified and the original InVEST UFRM model and then compared the results after incorporating rainfall raster into the model. Areas with developed land on the land use map predicted moderate to high flood volume in the original volume regardless of the actual amount of precipitation. The modified model considered the rainfall depth’s spatial variation achieving less overestimation of flood runoff and volume at low-to-moderate rainfall area."

In this paper, a design optimization study is carried out to compare mechanically geared, magnetically geared, and direct drive motor drivetrain topology achievable performance in a 100 kW hover power quad rotor propulsor application. Design studies are carried out accounting for a nominal mission profile. Studies are carried out assuming constant propulsor rotor RPMs of 400, 1000, 2000, and 3000 RPM. Results show that mechanically geared drives are the lightest at all RPMs but their weight benefit over direct drive and magnetically geared decays with increased rotor RPM. Direct drive is shown to always achieve the highest efficiency due to its lower motor speed resulting in low electrical frequencies. Magnetically geared drivetrains are shown to need some requirement refinement or technology improvement to provide significant benefit over direct drive drivetrains."

Not always — sometimes humans are the cause of success. This resilient performance is often overlooked. To capture this, we explore two types of <i>strategies: countermeasures</i> and <i>modifications</i>. First, <i>countermeasures</i> are behaviors triggered by variables anticipated to be challenging or problematic (<i>pressures</i>). To capture this, we look at examples of how a problem was avoided. For example, a country road may have a hairpin turn where accidents occur. With this <i>pressure</i> identified, we look at successful drivers for insights. <i>Modifications</i> are changes that are created to fill a gap between work-as-imagined and work-as-done. This <i>strategy</i> is from the design of systems. In aviation, work-as-imagined is often explicit, so it can be compared to behaviors using data. These two resilient potentials aim to better understand how systems function, as well as how people contribute to unrecognized successes."

Analytical solutions are developed for boundary-value problems on the slug element accounting for non-ideal effects, including spatial variation in the slug heat flux, multi-dimensional thermal conduction, and back-face losses, which departs from the state-of-the-art method derived from the American Society of Testing and Materials. Boundary-value problem definitions are informed by preliminary finite element thermal analysis of the slug calorimeter assembly (including both slug and housing) and just the slug element. The analytical solutions are presented in a general sense and in a truncated form from error analysis. Results are shown in optimizing and validating the analytical models against available slug back-face thermal data. The optimization results indicate that the appropriate epistemic uncertainty of the deduced stagnation heat flux on the slug calorimeter is at most±2.5% for both a high-and low-enthalpy test condition. In addition, a numerical approach is used to determine the aleatory (probabilistic) uncertainty component in the slug stagnation heat flux by applying a marching least-squares slope routine through the steady-state portion of the slug back-face thermal response. Results indicate a compromise between the number of samples and the filter frequency of slug back-face thermal data points when evaluating the standard deviation of the deduced stagnation heat flux statistics. When combining the mixed uncertainty, both aleatory and epistemic, the interval of uncertainty in the deduced stagnation heat flux is determined to be up to ±4%, which is at least a 60% reduction from the standard uncertainty used in the state-of-the-art method."

A prototype operational NAIRAS model has provided tabular and graphical data products via its public web site for about ten years. A new version of the NAIRAS model has been developed that incorporates an extension of the model domain from the atmospheric ionizing radiation environment to the space radiation environment, with the addition of the trapped inner belt proton source and altitude-dependent and rigidity-dependent geomagnetic shielding of the galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar energetic particle (SEP) protons. New output products of differential and integral particle flux have been developed for the characterization of single-event effects (SEE), expanding the application of NAIRAS from human radiation exposure assessment to allowing end-users to quantify radiation environment risks to aviation and spacecraft microelectronic systems. The NAIRAS model has transitioned to prototype operations at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) where the model now operates in two modes: (1) real-time global predictions of the atmospheric radiation environment and (2) a run-on-request (RoR) service allowing the user to select a specific time period for the global dosimetric calculations, or to upload an aircraft, balloon, or spaceflight trajectory file to provide predictions of the dosimetric and particle flux quantities along the flight path.

The Sterling Wildlife Management Area in Bingham County, Idaho, has management concerns about decadent and accumulated vegetation growth encroaching on wetland habitat, which presents challenges for wildlife, decreases biodiversity, and limits public access. Targeted grazing has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to chemical herbicides or burning. Land managers introduced targeted cattle grazing in January 2021 to reduce biomass. NASA DEVELOP partnered with the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to determine the impact of grazing using NASA Earth observations from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Images were processed with TerrSet’s Land Change Modeler and ArcGIS Pro’s Change Detection Wizard to understand land changes following grazing. A Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis was performed to assess impacts on vegetation productivity and compare variance in biomass before and after grazing. A Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to compare changes in the wetland and its vegetation content to evaluate the suitability of the area for migratory birds post-grazing. Results showed a decrease in the vegetation index and an increase in the water index postgrazing. The DEVELOP team’s analysis suggests that grazing helps break down thick, senesced vegetation and increase soil moisture. Providing a workflow model will aid partners in continuing to monitor this management area and other management areas across the state."

NPR 8715.26, Nuclear Flight Safety, requires that the NASA project manager “incorporate nuclear flight safety considerations starting with program or project formulation through the point at which the SNS or other radioactive material no longer has the potential to affect Earth’s biosphere.”  

NASA’s use of SNS inherently involves partnering with other stakeholders to conduct a range of
related activities that interface with nuclear flight safety. From a categorical perspective these
include: (i) meeting the authorities and licensing requirements for possession and use of nuclear
material, as governed by other Federal authorities; (ii) conducting National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) activities for nuclear-enabled missions; (iii) meeting Federal nuclear launch authorization requirements; (iv) conducting radiological contingency planning activities, including those associated with international commitments; (v) performing risk communication and public outreach activities; and (vi) ensuring decommissioning and disposal strategies reflect National policies and interests. It is the intent of this handbook to promote an effective interface between nuclear flight safety and these interrelated categorical activities.

In addition to activities undertaken with partnering agencies, there are individual nuclear-related
activities and programs that have a nexus to nuclear flight safety, and these include: (i) applicable NASA Standing Review Boards; (ii) the US Department of Energy nuclear safety activities conducted in partnership with NASA under Memoranda of Understanding; (iii) the Department of Defense’s Range Safety activities; (iv) NASA’s general involvement in interagency and international dialogues regarding nuclear safety; (v) the NASA-administered Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Board; (vi) NASA’s program and project governance activities and nuclear-specific Technical Discipline Team activities under the Office of the Chief Engineer; and others.

This paper reports a new approach to modeling the interface between fluid and material, with attention to the conservation of species mass flux and energy on the fluid side of the interface. The general equation is presented and is shown to recover the traditional uncoupled fluid/materials response interface. Including the chemical reaction terms on the CFD side of the interface makes the heat flux exchange independent of the thermodynamic reference state and, therefore, a measurable quantity. Doing so allows the material response solver to take as input the surface heat flux rather than a film coefficient. Removing the film coefficient approximation enables more direct solution of vehicle thermal response but requires consistency in the wall state.     The mixing of the shock layer and pyrolysis gas is then computed with finite rate chemistry within the fluid solver. The boundary conditions described have been implemented in the DPLR v4.05.1 code. Char removal is captured using finite rate chemistry in DPLR’s gas surface interaction module. Aspects of coupling these solutions to material response are discussed."

This spacesuit is under development to support missions to the International Space Station (ISS) and also to the Moon. Improvements in the life and robustness of the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) has been a major objective of these efforts. The Suit Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME) was chosen as the technology to provide cooling to the xEMU and has undergone several iterations of development over this period. An ISS flight experiment centered around the SWME and other thermal control loop (TCL) technologies was developed and tested in an ISS EXpedite PRocessing of Experiments to the Space Station (EXPRESS) rack from November of 2020 to August of 2022. In addition to the SWME, the SWME EXPRESS Rack Flight Experiment (SERFE) contains several technologies from the xEMU project and demonstrated their performance in micro-gravity and over an extended duration. These included two dissimilar water pumps, custom check valves, custom bypass relieve valves, a custom thermal control valve, development pressure and temperature sensors, and the thermal loop controller. This paper presents PLSS component lessons learned after return of the SERFE flight unit in August of 2022.

Tests were conducted over a constant tensile stress range of 40–200 MPa and a temperature range of 973–1173 K. A stress exponent of 6.5 ± 0.1 and activation energies in the range of 335–367 kJ/mol were measured. Compared to its non-ODS counterpart and its parent alloy (CrMnFeCoNi), AM ODS CrCoNi has superior creep resistance at all tested stresses and temperatures. The mechanism contributing to the excellent creep resistance of AM ODS CrCoNi is attributed to the interaction of mixed character dislocations with oxide particles. The creep ductility of AM ODS CrCoNi is higher than its nonODS counterpart due to a large percentage of low angle grain boundaries associated with its columnar grain structure. It was also found that creep ductility is significantly greater at the highest applied stress of 200 MPa compared to lower stresses. The steady state dislocation structure of AM ODS CrCoNi consists of long arrays of dislocations, which is different from that observed in non-ODS CrCoNi which consists of individual curved dislocations."

In this Review, we summarize how irrigation currently impacts key components of the Earth system. Estimates suggest that more than 3.6 million km<sup>2</sup> of currently irrigated land, with hot spots in the intensively cultivated US High Plains, California Central Valley, Indo-Gangetic Basin and northern China. Process-based models estimate that ~2,700 ± 540 km<sup>3</sup> irrigation water is withdrawn globally each year, broadly consistent with country-reported values despite these estimates embedding substantial uncertainties. Expansive irrigation has modified surface energy balance and biogeochemical cycling. A shift from sensible to latent heat fluxes, and resulting land–atmosphere feedbacks, generally reduce regional growing season surface temperatures by ~1–3 °C. Irrigation can ameliorate temperature extremes in some regions, but conversely exacerbates moist heat stress. Modelled precipitation responses are more varied, with some intensive cropping regions exhibiting suppressed local precipitation but enhanced precipitation downstream owing to atmospheric circulation interactions. Additionally, irrigation could enhance cropland carbon uptake; however, it can also contribute to elevated methane fluxes in rice systems and mobilize nitrogen loading to groundwater. Cross-disciplinary, integrative research efforts can help advance understanding of these irrigation–Earth system interactions, and identify and reduce uncertainties, biases and limitations."

A unique design feature of these chambers is the gaseous helium cryopumping panels within the liquid nitrogen shroud. This shroud is used to bring the chamber to cryogenic temperatures while the cryopumping panels trap gasses using their large surface area in order to create a high vacuum environment of 5*10^-6 Torr.
	In preparation for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) flight test, a series of functionals required the chamber to run at higher temperatures, and therefore did not need active cooling from the liquid nitrogen shroud. During testing, cryopumping panels were used to mitigate contamination during this main shroud warm-up. One of the cryopumping panels in Chamber A was covered with several layers of aluminized mylar in order to thermally protect the zone from the warmed shroud. This strategy was effective and became part of operations during JWST testing.
	Currently, Chamber B has requests for both commercial and NASA space suit tests at both high and low temperatures to accurately generate thermal models. High temperature tests would greatly benefit from simultaneous shroud warming and the high vacuum environment provided by the cryopumping panels. This paper will quantitatively define the thermal loads on the panels used in previous Chamber A warm up sequences. Additionally, this report will perform a thermal analysis to judge the feasibility of adding layers of aluminized mylar to the cryopumping panels of Chamber B."

The model is validated with a minimally intrusive, approximate point source of heat in the Quiet Flow Facility at the NASA Langley Research Center.

And it will don a new spacesuit when it reaches its destination. NASA is partnering with industry to build the spacesuit and supporting systems (i.e., surface mobility tools) that astronauts will use on the Moon, starting with Artemis III. The Johnson Space Center’s (JSC) Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface Mobility Program (EHP) is managing this effort, and the U.S. Spacesuit Knowledge Capture (SKC) Program is expanding its scope to help. For 15 years, the SKC Program has collected, archived, and disseminated decades of spacesuit-related knowledge, as appropriate, to help NASA scientists, technicians, and engineers support space exploration. The SKC Program captures its knowledge by hosting and recording subject-matter expert (SME) lectures, interviews, and workshops. It also collects retired SMEs’ reports, drawings, and schematics containing legacy spacesuit knowledge. To build a technically capable spacesuit essential for future lunar exploration, spacesuit professionals borrowed much of their knowledge from legacy Extravehicular Activity (EVA) spacesuits. Most of the SKC Program’s captured knowledge has focused on legacy and current spacesuits. To support EHP, the SKC Program is expanding its knowledge capture focus beyond the spacesuit and will seek to collect knowledge from other pertinent topics (e.g., Lunar Terrain Vehicle and EVA tools). In 2007, the SKC Program began as an independent source, without funding. As demand for capturing essential spacesuit knowledge increased, consequently, the SKC Program’s funding increased. Expansion of the SKC Program was evident in 2019, when it seized the opportunity to capture the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) buildup at JSC. In 2021, its collaboration with the xEMU Technical Community of Practice facilitated training and knowledge sharing with the xEMU team. In 2022, the SKC Program began supporting EHP. This paper describes the SKC Program’s expansive evolution, plans to support EHP, and more."

Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida. The primary objective of the HCS is to attain hydraulic control of the dissolved-phase chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) plume, with the secondary objective to reduce concentrations of CVOCs in the high-concentration plume to support transition to monitored natural attenuation (MNA). CRCA has been designated Solid Waste Management Unit 041 under the KSC Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program. 

The timeframe for activities documented in this Year 3 PMR extends from September 2021 through October 2022. Baseline sampling activities were completed in June 2019, and full-scale startup of the HCS IM was completed in July-August 2019. The operational runtime of the HCS for the Year 3 reporting period was approximately 91%, with the majority of downtime attributed to system maintenance and repair. This is generally consistent with Year 1 and Year 2 runtimes of 85% and 92%, respectively. To help reduce downtime, an anti-scaling amendment, Redux 390, has been used to reduce scaling and help maintain system design parameters. Over nine million gallons of groundwater were treated during Year 3 of HCS operations, and concentrations of the site’s contaminants of concern (trans-1,2-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride) have been reduced by over 97%.

This PMR describes the activities that were performed during Year 3 to operate and monitor the HCS IM, which includes three extraction wells, seven injection wells, and conveyance piping to a modular structure containing the control panel and an air stripper. Influent and effluent sampling results from the air stripper show that the system is operating as designed and is reducing concentrations of contaminants of concern to below detection limits. In addition to HCS operation, this PMR also discusses performance monitoring that has been implemented to assess progress of the HCS IM and overall plume conditions through scheduled groundwater (quarterly and semi-annual) and sub-slab soil gas (quarterly) sampling and analysis. Two ambient air samples were also collected on a quarterly basis in the vicinity of the modular structure and the paved driveway east of the Solvent Reclamation Area during routine operation and maintenance (O&M) activities to ensure safe breathing zone air quality for on-site personnel. All sub-slab soil gas and ambient air sampling conducted during the Year 3 operational period showed results below applicable regulatory air screening limits.

Predictions made during the Year 2 groundwater model updates were in close correlation to post Year 3 plume conditions. Therefore, it can be assumed that the projected path remains valid for transition to MNA in one to two years of continuous HCS operation.

The contents of this Year 3 PMR were presented during the February 2023 KSC Remediation Team meeting, where Team consensus was reached on several items including continued O&M of the HCS, and continued monitoring of groundwater, ambient air, and sub-slab soil gas. Replacement of MW0019 and VMP04 was also recommended, as well as additional direct-push technology sampling to further delineate the downgradient plume and confirm overall site-wide low-concentration plume boundaries. Sampling for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances at CRCA is ongoing and will be submitted under separate cover."

Design of experiments was used to create input feature spaces, and a high-fidelity strategy was implemented at the discrete data points defined by the input feature spaces to design airfoils and rotor blades, predict the unsteady rotor aerodynamics and aeroacoustics, and isolate the blade-wake interaction noise from the acoustic broadband noise. A metric for the blade-wake interaction noise was developed, and the ANOPP2 Artificial Neural Network Tool was used to identify an optimal prediction model for the nonlinear relationship between the input features and the metric for blade-wake interaction noise. This optimal artificial neural network was then validated over training/test data and exhibited prediction accuracy over 91% for data previously unseen by the model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted, which showed that input features that directly modify the thrust coefficient had a dominant effect over blade-wake interaction noise. The optimal prediction model along with aerodynamic simulations were used to further study the effect of varying input features on blade-wake interaction noise, and three types of blade-wake interaction noise were identified"

This information will be critical for improving our ability to model and predict changes in the Earth's climate, as well as to manage and conserve our planet's valuable natural resources.

Performance assessments and science data product validation is a critical process for any Earth Science space-borne mission, as it involves assessing and verifying the quality of the data products generated by the mission while it is in orbit, as well as assigning uncertainties to these retrievals. More specifically, validation efforts are essential for assessing the accuracy of instrument data and the derived science products across varied spatial and temporal scales and ensuring their reliability and consistency with the mission's scientific goals and objectives. The overall plan for validation of PACE data is described in “PACE Science Data Product Validation Plan” (see, e.g., https://pace.gsfc.nasa.gov), and among range of post-launch activities, it describes the need and requirements for a post-launch airborne field campaign in support of PACE validation.

This volume outlines the plans and requirements of the PACE Postlaunch Airborne eXperiment (PACE-PAX). The main goal of PACE-PAX is to gather validation and assessment data for the PACE mission, using a variety of airborne and ground-based assets. These assets will be coordinated to obtain complementary measurements of key ocean and atmospheric variables, such as ocean color, aerosols, and clouds. By collecting data from multiple sources, PACE-PAX will help to validate and refine the data products generated by the PACE mission, as well as to identify any potential errors or biases in the measurements.

Ongoing efforts are focused on mitigating mission-related risks, including those affecting crew health and performance. Communication latency, logistics of resupply and time frame of medical evacuation are barriers to provision of healthcare for these missions, especially with respect to constraints in mass, volume, and crew training. An in-depth assessment of medical risks, capabilities and resources for a specific mission design is necessary to determine an optimal balance that maximizes likelihood of mission success.

<strong>Overview:</strong> IMPACT (Informed Mission Planning via Analysis of Complex Tradespaces) is a dynamic tool designed to estimate medical risk and outcomes for a specific mission design. In its current iteration, a list of medical conditions selected based on likelihood of occurrence and/or consequence was linked to a set of clinical capabilities and resources necessary for diagnosis and management. A probabilistic risk analysis tool was then used to identify and estimate the likelihood and consequence of risks through the following outcome metrics: loss of crew life (inflight mortality due to medical conditions), need for medical evacuation (return to definitive care), and crew disability (task time affected based on how medical conditions influence the ability to perform specific exploration mission crew tasks). Finally, the model’s optimization algorithm provides recommendations for medical capabilities that maximize risk mitigation relative to mass and volume constraints. In the Spring of 2023, IMPACT was utilized to estimate outcome metrics for a design reference mission that would be representative of an extended duration Artemis mission. Notional data generated were then used to determine a recommended set of medical capabilities and resources relative to user-defined mass and volume constraints. A multidisciplinary team has also been updating IMPACT to strengthen the model’s fidelity. Figure 1 shows how updates to outcome metric inputs for the conditions resulted in different capability and resource allocation recommendations.

<strong>Discussion:</strong> This presentation will discuss the IMPACT tool and share the latest data generated for a representative extended duration Artemis mission. Efforts to improve the fidelity of data generated by the model’s algorithm will also be discussed."

The tank was discretized into nodes in the radial and axial directions to calculate two-dimensional axisymmetric flow with heat transfer between the solid wall and fluid. The nodes are connected by branches where momentum equations are solved to calculate the flowrates. The mass and energy conservation equations and the equation of state are solved to calculate pressure, temperature, and resident mass at the nodes. The energy conservation equations at the solid nodes were solved to calculate the temperature of the solid wall. The system of equations was solved by a combination of successive substitution and simultaneous Newton-Raphson method. The numerical model accounts for a) different regimes of pool boiling heat transfer, b) condensation of vapor around the spray droplets, c) condensation of vapor at the interface of the cooled injector and ullage, and d) condensation at the liquid-vapor interphase. The numerical predictions of tank pressure, filling rate, and wall temperatures were compared with the test data. The paper also presents the effect of nodal discretization by comparing the results of the 1D and 2D models and examines the effect of the droplet diameter on tank filling."

Within each of these broad goals, significant achievements have been made in aeronautics over the decades. Specialized military aircraft can reach the edges of the atmosphere and regularly fly at supersonic speeds, with the Concorde bringing transatlantic supersonic flight to the public. In addition, commercial subsonic aircraft regularly fly nonstop flights of over 7000 nautical miles with flight times lasting over 15 hours. Each of these achievements have been enabled by research and development on the technologies required to overcome these barriers. As major technical challenges for high-speed/hypersonic flight have been overcome, the next questions that arise relate to what precisely is a viable commercial high-speed/hypersonic vehicle and what is the market for it. In 2020, NASA funded two studies to provide an independent assessment of the economic viability of high-speed/hypersonic transportation and some high level guidance on the design requirements of such a vehicle. Results from these market studies will be presented as well as insight into how these results are being used to inform ongoing strategic planning efforts in this research area within NASA’s Hypersonic Technology project."

These meshes capture important geometric features of the design and can be used in machine learning modeling. This report explores the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn features from two-dimensional (2D) airfoil designs represented as a set of nodes connected using edges. This type of network is common in aerospace applications: most geometries are represented as a mesh in order to perform analysis. The objective of this work is to use GNNs to predict the performance of 2D airfoils generated using the program XFOIL. The predicted performance parameters include bulk quantities such as coefficients of lift (C<sub>L</sub>), drag (C<sub>d</sub>, C<sub>dp</sub>), moment (C<sub>m</sub>), and node-specific quantities such as coefficient of pressure (C<sub>p</sub>). In this report, a spline convolutional graph-based neural network is compared with deep learning neural networks to predict both bulk and node-specific quantities. The findings indicate the GNNs are able to predict bulk quantities quite well; however, when the number of outputs is increased, the deep neural network (DNN) proves to be better in its prediction capability. Two different normalization strategies were compared in the training of both GNNs and DNNs: minmax and standard deviation. In both types of networks, standard deviation scaling proved to be the best."

There are currently no hypotheses for the origin of this ring in the literature, so we explore four different origin scenarios here: the dust originated from (1) the sporadic meteoroid complex that comprises the major portion of the Zodiacal Cloud, (2) recent asteroidal/cometary activity, (3) hypothetical dust-generating bodies locked in mean-motion resonances beyond Mercury, and (4) bodies co-orbiting with Mercury. We find that only scenario (4) reproduces the observed structure and location of Mercury's dust ring. However, the lifetimes of Mercury's co-orbitals (<20 Ma) preclude a primordial origin of the co-orbiting source population due to dynamical instabilities and meteoroid bombardment, demanding a recent event feeding the observed dust ring. We find that an impact on Mercury can eject debris into the co-orbital resonance. We estimate the ages of six candidate impacts that formed craters larger than 40 km in diameter using high-resolution spacecraft data from MESSENGER and find two craters with estimated surface ages younger than 50 Ma. We find that the amount of mass transported from Mercury's surface into the co-orbital resonance from these two impacts is several orders of magnitude smaller than what is needed to explain the magnitude of Mercury's ring inferred from remote sensing. Therefore we suggest that numerous younger, smaller impacts collectively contributed to the origin of the ring. We conclude that the recent impact hypothesis for the origin of Mercury's dust ring is a viable scenario, whose validity can be constrained by future inner solar system missions."

For exploration missions, returned water samples will not be an option, so spacecraft and habitats will need to be equipped with advanced water monitoring capabilities. Eventually, missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond should be equipped with analytical capabilities roughly analogous to those found in terrestrial labs. Based on what we know about current and future spacecraft environments, SWIM will seek to provide enhanced analytical capability that enables NASA to confidently send astronauts on distant missions without the possibility of returned water samples.

The SWIM architecture can be broken down in an Organic Water Module (OWM) and an Inorganic Water Module (IWM), independent of each other but can be flown together if desired; an integrated system may share some commonality, e.g., single sample injection, sampling consumables, waste, etc. Each of these main modules can be broken down further into separation (if required) and detection modules. And, each separation module can be paired with one or more detection module depending on mission, spacecraft, customer needs, and size/mass/power constraints.

This paper discusses the research and development progress toward the goal of a total water analysis system. For OWM, one of the analysis technologies that the SWIM team have been developing is a liquid-injection gas chromatograph mass spectrometer system; these systems are the workhorses of analytical chemistry laboratories world-wide.

Low-booms were propagated through realistic atmospheric profiles from the Climate Forecast System Version 2 across the USA, and loudness statistics of the low-booms are presented. The near-field waveforms correspond to aircraft configurations expected to produce minimum- and maximum-loudness levels on the ground. The simulations show that the practical Perceived Level noise dose range is 72 to 86.7 dB. Dose ranges for other single event and cumulative sonic boom metrics of interest are also provided."

ExoMiner was recently trained and utilized to classify Kepler transit signals and validate hundreds of new exoplanets from the Kepler mission. ExoMiner++ addresses some of the shortcomings of the original ExoMiner, which includes adding new diagnostic test inputs and updating some aspects of the architecture. In this talk, we discuss ExoMiner++ and its performance on the TESS data. We will explain some of the differences between the TESS and Kepler missions data and how we handle these differences in order to have a classifier trained on Kepler data transferred to accurately classify TESS signals."

The ruggedness experiment was designed with eight runs in two replicates, consisting of seven factors: strain rate (ė), heating and cooling rates (Ṫ<sub>heat</sub> and Ṫ<sub>cool</sub>, respectively), upper and lower cycle temperatures (UCT and LCT, respectively), hold time (t<sub>hold</sub>), and minimum load (F<sub>min</sub>) imparted on the samples. The results indicate that the strain rate factor had no effect on any result variable, whereas the minimum load factor had a large effect on several result variables including the austenite start and martensite finish temperatures as well as most of the strain measurements from the thermal cycle. The lower cycle temperature factor had a large effect on the stress at maximum strain during pre-straining (e<sub>i</sub>), denoted by S<sub>i</sub>, at ~7.2 MPa, as well as the A<sub>f</sub>, at 5.47 °C. Closely following the LCT effect, Ṫ<sub>heat</sub> was found to have a large effect on the austenite start temperature (A<sub>s</sub>), at a value of ~2.72 °C. The testing methodology, analysis techniques, and resulting conclusions on the ruggedness of the test method are presented."

The MTB was designed to allow adjustment of the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal placement of up to six rotors, as well as allow tilt adjustment of each rotor and pitch adjustment of the whole assembly. The six-axis load cells under each rotor give the MTB the capability of measuring the rotor performance in a wide array of configurations. The overall goal of the MTB project is to help gain a better understanding of the performance, control, interactional aerodynamics, and acoustics of multirotor and tilting-rotor systems.

The MTB project was initiated to build upon the knowledge and capabilities developed during the multirotor unmanned aerial systems (MUAS) tests in 2015 and 2017. By measuring individual rotor loads and allowing for adjustments to individual rotor position and attitude, the MTB provides a wealth of data on the aeroperformance of arbitrary multirotor configurations. The flexibility in positioning up to six rotors allows the multirotor design space to be parametrically explored and potentially optimized. The MTB is also at a larger scale than the small unmanned aerial systems (UAS) tested before, which allows for testing at rotor tip Reynolds numbers more relevant to full-scale piloted electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. 

This document contains the complete documentation of the design, loads, and stress analysis of the MTB."

The hardware problem, a capacitor installed incorrectly, removes the intended redundant path for which the PDU can relay its power and data to attached devices. Specific to the BONA context, the concern is that a failure of the single remaining path in this PDU would lead to an inability to communicate with one of the two-star trackers (STs) on Orion. By flight rule, being reduced to a single star tracker means an immediate turn around end-of-mission.
The BONA software is not intended to extend the mission, but instead act as a single star tracker attitude confirmation tool. Insurance, if you will, for the Orion project that a ground tool is available to compare the single remaining ST results with optical navigation images retrieved during the mission. Engineers operating BONA in the Mission Control Center (MCC) Mission Evaluation Room (MER) will analyze the downlinked star field images and based on the stars identified and known time of image, derive vehicle attitude estimates, which can be compared with the ST results. Potentially, in extreme situations, and with expert recommendation, the derivations could lead to navigation state updates being commanded to Orion."

iterative, and continual process for making informed decisions. NASA faces diverse and
relatively unique challenges and opportunities as the leading U.S. agency for aeronautics
development, cutting-edge scientific discovery, and human space exploration. To address these
challenges and leverage opportunities, NASA uses foresight to strategically plan technology
development across four mission directorates: Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, Space
Technology Mission Directorate, Science Mission Directorate, and Human Exploration and
Operations Mission Directorate (recently separated into the new Exploration Systems
Development Mission Directorate and Space Operations Mission Directorate). The mission
directorates leverage a broad community of experts and partners to incorporate technology
foresight into mission and program planning. Through this process NASA realizes tangible
benefits to the agency’s science, technology, and exploration programs.

As an independent office, NASA’s Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy (OTPS) provides
strategic advice, supported by independent assessments and rigorous analysis, to inform NASA
senior leadership on key areas to align mission and agency-level activities. OTPS serves as a
trusted authority to inform technology strategy at the agency to enable future missions.
Specifically, OTPS coordinates and uses inputs from a broad community of experts, both internal
and external to NASA, to inform decision making for technology plans, investments, and
partnerships. OTPS develops and maintains the NASA Technology Taxonomy to standardize
communication across the agency’s diverse technology portfolio and the related Strategic
Technology Investment Plan that integrates priorities and informs technology investment.
Through these efforts, OTPS has refined elements of foresight-informed strategic planning that
may be applicable to other technology-driven industries where foresight is essential for
resilience.

This chapter describes the processes of foresight for technology development at NASA and
provides insight into the value the agency derives from these processes. The chapter further
describes the role of OTPS as an independent advisory office that supports NASA’s efforts to
capitalize on foresight and strategic technology planning. We present these examples with
consideration for how organizations in defense, security, and other technology-driven industries
can operationalize foresight in their own strategic technology development."

 Revision C updates the Revision B version of the SRB Handbook published in 2016 to incorporate updates to NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 7120.5F, NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management Requirements. These updates include:
 - Changing the Dissenting Opinion process to the Formal Dissent process, which retains the current process augmented with an expedited escalation path.
 - Updates to requirements for establishing an Agency Baseline Commitment (ABC) and for performing Joint Cost and Schedule Confidence Level (JCL) analyses for tightly coupled programs.
 - Additional requirements for performing a JCL analysis for single-project programs and projects over $1B Life-Cycle Cost (LCC).
 - Use of initial capability cost estimates instead of LCC estimates in specific, identified instances for single-project programs and projects that plan continuing operations and production, including integration of capability upgrades, with an unspecified Phase E end point. These single-project programs and projects define an initial capability during Phase A and develop an initial capability cost that establishes the ABC at Key Decision Point (KDP) C. Initial capability is the first operational mission flight (or as defined in the KDP B Review Plan) and is documented in the KDP B Decision Memorandum. Initial capability cost includes operations cost for the initial capability. The Phase E cost estimate for continuing operations and production is established separately as part of the Operational Readiness Review (ORR) and KDP E for the 5 years after initial capability and subsequently updated and documented annually for the next 5-year period. Upgrades during Phase E that meet the Agency criteria for a major project for external reporting are treated as projects for the purposes of establishing their own development ABC outside the Phase E cost estimate. The Phase E cost estimate is updated to include production and operations costs associated with these upgrades. Development, production, and operations costs of other (i.e., non-major) upgrades are included in the Phase E cost estimate. (See NPR 7120.5, Sections 2.4.1.5 and 2.4.1.6 and the NASA Space Flight Program and Project Management Handbook (PM Handbook), Section 5.5.4 for additional information.) The scope of the SRB’s assessment with respect to initial capability, Phase E cost estimate, and major upgrades for these single-project programs and projects is defined in the Terms of Reference (ToR)."

The mission’s primary science goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun’s coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Parker Solar Probe returned a treasure trove of science data that far exceeded quality, significance, and quantity expectations, leading to a significant number of discoveries reported in nearly 700 peer-reviewed publications. The first four years of the 7-year primary mission duration have been mostly during solar minimum conditions with few major solar events. Starting with orbit 8 (i.e., 28 Apr. 2021), Parker flew through the magnetically dominated corona, i.e., sub-Alfvénic solar wind, which is one of the mission’s primary objectives. In this paper, we present an overview of the scientific advances made mainly during the first four years of the Parker Solar Probe mission, which go well beyond the three science objectives that are: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles."

The goal of this work was to take a 3D icosphere, where each face was a point to be evaluated, and display the link performance onto a 2D projection of celestial bodies for links to a node location that could be spatially located at any of the icosahedral faces. 2D projections were produced for a wide range of spatial link grid sizes and compressed into low-size MAT files for ease of access and rapid implementation. The final icosahedral projections can be displayed onto various celestial body maps, using ultra-high-resolution maps for stitching. The results have proven satisfactory and are planned to support various simulation efforts."

A unique design feature of these chambers is the gaseous helium cryopumping panels within the liquid nitrogen shroud. This shroud is used to bring the chamber to cryogenic temperatures while the cryopumping panels trap gasses using their large surface area in order to create a high vacuum environment of 5*10^-6 Torr.
	In preparation for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) flight test, a series of functionals required the chamber to run at higher temperatures, and therefore did not need active cooling from the liquid nitrogen shroud. During testing, cryopumping panels were used to mitigate contamination during this main shroud warm-up. One of the cryopumping panels in Chamber A was covered with several layers of aluminized mylar in order to thermally protect the zone from the warmed shroud. This strategy was effective and became part of operations during JWST testing.
	Currently, Chamber B has requests for both commercial and NASA space suit tests at both high and low temperatures to accurately generate thermal models. High temperature tests would greatly benefit from simultaneous shroud warming and the high vacuum environment provided by the cryopumping panels. This paper will quantitatively define the thermal loads on the panels used in previous Chamber A warm up sequences. Additionally, this report will perform a thermal analysis to judge the feasibility of adding layers of aluminized mylar to the cryopumping panels of Chamber B."

Phytoplankton is the base of majority of ocean ecosystems. It is responsible for half of the global primary production, and different  phytoplankton taxa have a unique role in global biogeochemical cycles. In addition, phytoplankton abundance and diversity are highly susceptible to climate induced changes, hence monitoring of phytoplankton and its diversity is important and necessary. 

Methods. Water samples for phytoplankton and photosynthetic pigment analyses were collected in boreal winter 2017, along transect in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) and the California Current System (CCS). Phytoplankton community was analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy and photosynthetic pigments by high-performance liquid chromatography. To describe distinct ecosystems, monthly average satellite data of MODIS Aqua Sea Surface temperature and Chlorophyll a concentration, as well as Apparent Visible Wavelength were used. 

Results. A total of 207 taxa have been determined, mostly comprised of coccolithophores (35.5%), diatoms (25.2%) and dinoflagellates (19.5%) while cryptophytes, phytoflagellates and silicoflagellates were included in the group ``others"" (19.8%). Phytoplankton spatial distribution was distinct, indicating variable planktonic dispersal rates and specific adaptation to ecosystems. Dinoflagellates, and nano-scale coccolithophores dominated NPSG, while micro-scale diatoms, and cryptophytes prevailed in CCS. A clear split between CCS and NPSG is evident in dendogram visualising LINKTREE constrained binary divisive clustering analysis done on phytoplankton counts and pigment  oncentrations. Of all pigments determined, alloxanthin, zeaxanthin, divinyl
chlorophyll b and lutein have highest correlation to phytoplankton counts.

Conclusion. Combining chemotaxonomy and microscopy is an optimal method to determine phytoplankton diversity on a large-scale transect. Distinct communities between the two contrasting ecosystems of North Pacific reveal phytoplankton groups specific adaptations to trophic state, and support the hypothesis of shift from microto nano-scale taxa due to sea surface temperatures rising, favoring stratification and oligotrophic conditions."

hydrological cycle typically transporting water vapor poleward, delivering precipitation important for local climates. Understanding ARs in a warming climate is problematic because the AR response to climate change is tied to how the feature is defined. The Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) provides insights into this problem by comparing 16 atmospheric river detection tools (ARDTs) to a common dataset consisting of high resolution climate change simulations from a global atmospheric general circulation model. ARDTs mostly show increases in frequency and intensity, but the scale of the response is largely dependent on algorithmic criteria. Across ARDTs, bulk characteristics suggest intensity and spatial footprint are inversely correlated, and most focus regions experience increases in precipitation volume coming from extreme ARs. The spread of the AR precipitation response under climate change is large and dependent on ARDT selection."

The Human Physiology, Performance, Protection & Operations Laboratory (H-3PO) at NASA is developing a Hybrid Spacesuit Simulator (HS3) to support testing and characterization of human performance during analog planetary exploration extravehicular activities (EVAs). The goal of HS3 is to create a low-cost, modular, and unpressurized spacesuit simulator as a research tool that provides relevant physical and cognitive workload approximations with EVA-like immersion. HS3 consists of a soft outer suit, thermal control, gloves, boots, helmet, and integrated bioinformatics and communications.

Baseline HS3 assessments were performed during 3-hour EVA simulations in two different subjects (DEMO1 and DEMO2) that included traverses at variable resistances and geological sampling activities. Liquid cooling garment (LCG) temperature, mean skin temperature, heart rate, motion capture, and metabolic rate were collected during each 3-hour simulated EVA. During DEMO1 and DEMO2, baseline metabolic rates at rest were 836 ± 327 BTU/hr and 869 ± 207 BTU/hr and increased to 2124 ± 548 BTU/hr and 2269 ± 559 BTU/hr, respectively, during 500m traverse. Average inlet LCG temperatures were 29.57 ± 6.62 °C and 25.63 ± 6.48 °C for DEMO1 and DEMO2 with increased outlet LCG temperatures of 33.53 ± 6.62 °C and 29.21 ± 4.79 °C, respectively. Overall, HS3 will enable future studies to characterize EVA tasks, human performance, and test future EVA capabilities in analog test environments without the need for pressurized suited environments."

Deep space travel will include added risk related to stressors from the isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environment that lies outside the boundaries of low-earth orbit.  Currently, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the gold standard treatment for many mental health diagnoses including anxiety and depression; however, SSRIs are also associated with several undesired side effects.  The utility of non-pharmacologic therapies for the management of behavioral health conditions has not yet been fully explored.
Methods:  A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and relevant articles pertaining to the psychological impacts of ICE environments, use of SSRIs in spaceflight, side effects associated with SSRIs, and non-pharmacologic treatments for anxiety and depression were reviewed.  Over 100 studies were reviewed in total.
Results:  Reduced bone mineral density, impaired hemostatic function, significant individual variability resulting from gene polymorphisms, and drug-drug interactions are well described adverse effects of SSRIs that may complicate their operational use in the deep space environment.  Many non-pharmacologic therapies have been utilized with success for the management of behavioral health conditions in the terrestrial environment that may show promise for long duration missions. 
Discussion:  Although SSRIs have long been considered standard of care treatment for many behavioral health conditions, we cannot trivialize the risk that prolonged pharmacologic therapy may pose.  The need to mitigate these risks by exploring alternative non-pharmacologic therapies has never been more relevant."

Because these systems will be provided by multiple commercial companies working with NASA, it will be very different from missions of the past, bringing new challenges. One of the challenges is related to whether NASA should move beyond simple tone annunciation alerting systems, to more advanced systems that include speech. The other is related to determining the level of consistency required of safety-critical alert systems across spacecraft. Two studies were completed to address these important issues. The first study investigated the advantages and disadvantages of a tone+speech alert relative to the traditional tone-only alert. Results indicate that speech-enhanced alerts initially take longer to silence (the default action to which NASA personnel are trained), due to the need to listen to the entire message, but ultimately provided for faster understanding of the alert situation. Speech-enhanced alerts were also preferred by a large majority of crew-like study participants. An unexpected finding was that participants took longer to respond to tone-only alerts that were heard in the same session as speech-enhanced alerts. Participants waited to hear a speech message even for alerts they were trained to know did not contain speech components. This performance error is believed to be due to negative transfer of training. A second study focused on task and alert performance using a common set of tones across two contexts (e.g., vehicles, habitats, suits) versus performance with a different set of tones for each context. Participants were able to manage two different alert sets successfully; results indicate that discriminability of the two alert sets played a major role in their success. Implications for the design of spacecraft alerts are discussed, and future areas of research are identified."

The effect of particle velocity, particle size, and impingement angle were investigated. Results show that the erosion damage in the EBC is primarily controlled by particle kinetic energy. In addition, the effect of impingement angle demonstrates the contribution of the tangential component of velocity."

The interaction of five homonuclear diatomic gases, Cl<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, with several pure metals are examined using Coulomb’s law to calculate the attractive and repulsive forces between the electrons or ions in the gas molecule and the free surface metallic electrons or ions assuming a Bohr model. These calculations demonstrate that the total energy of the electrostatic fields from the metals can exceed the molecular binding energies of Cl<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub> at some distance from the metallic surface thereby suggesting that these gases interact primarily with the metallic surface in their atomic states after molecular bond dissociation prior to reaction. In contrast, H<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> gases do not dissociate prior to reaching the metal surface due to the fact that the effective charge of the gas ions is less than the total electron charge at the outermost electronic shell. The present results correlate linearly with the electrochemical series standard reduction potential as well as with the Pauling electronegativity for several metals."

Current Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations show that the HCS crossings near the Sun could be full or partial current sheet (PCS) crossings, and they share some common features but also have different properties. In this work, using the PSP observations from encounters 4–10, we identify streamer belt solar wind from enhancements in plasma β, and we further use electron pitch angle distributions to separate it into HPS solar wind around the full HCS crossings and PCS solar wind in the vicinity of PCS crossings. Based on our analysis, we find that the PCS solar wind has different characteristics as compared with HPS solar wind: (a) the PCS solar wind could be non-pressure-balanced structures rather than magnetic holes, and the total pressure enhancement mainly results from the less reduced magnetic pressure; (b) some of the PCS solar wind is mirror-unstable; and (c) the PCS solar wind is dominated by very low helium abundance but varied alpha–proton differential speed. We suggest that the PCS solar wind could originate from coronal loops deep inside the streamer belt, and it is pristine solar wind that still actively interacts with ambient solar wind; thus, it is valuable for further investigations of the heating and acceleration of slow solar wind."

Robust cleaning and sterilization protocols are currently in place in NASA facilities, but agency experts agree that microbial contamination is unavoidable and its impact on NASA’s missions and science must be minimized. Therefore, it is critical to understand: 1) what specific microorganisms are present, 2) how they may impact scientific objectives, and 3) how to select appropriate mitigation strategies. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Planetary Protection (PP) microbiology lab historically relied solely upon enumeration of culturable microbial contamination associated with spacecraft materials or cleanrooms. However, this process is time consuming, many microbes cannot be cultured, and very few can be identified with any fidelity using NASA standard microbiological methods. The work described in this white paper includes the establishment of molecular identification capabilities at MSFC, including DNA isolation, amplification, purification, and Sanger sequencing. This capability will not only improve planetary protection efforts at MSFC (i.e. by identifying contaminating microorganisms in cleanrooms or on spacecraft) but also offers a service center-wide for the identification of contaminants that arise in other projects, processing locations, or during set up and roll out of spacecraft. This work also lays the foundation for higher throughput efforts to identify large populations of microbes across the lifetime of a project and serves as the starting point for future work into whole genome sequencing, non-culture based methods, or additional characterization studies. Ultimately, accurate identification informs appropriate mitigation strategies, increasing the chances of success for NASA’s missions and objectives."

This group of people have inherited property left with no clear title and thus have unclear group ownership with the other legal owners, which are all spouses, children, etc. of past owners. After Hurricane Irma made landfall in Georgia in September of 2017, heirs property owners became more likely to be denied access to federal relief due to the legal status of their property title. To observe how this group was impacted by Hurricane Irma, the NASA DEVELOP team partnered with The Georgia Heirs Property Law Center (The Center), a non-profit law firm that works with heirs properties owners. The team used computer assisted mass appraisal (CAMA) data to identify likely heirs property owners. They cross referenced this map with a flood map produced with surface reflectance and backscatter imagery from Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and Sentinel-1 C-SAR, sensors to identify communities in need of relief or assistance. The flood extent maps were validated against United States Geological Survey (USGS) Hurricane Irma High Water Mark in situ data taken the same day Irma crossed into Georgia. To further evaluate the impacted group, the team correlated the flood and heirs property likelihood maps to FEMA denials based on titles issues. The team’s end products were handed off to the Georgia Heirs Property Law Center for use in community outreach, educational materials, and to help direct where The Center can work to prioritize its limited legal resources."

A diverse mixture of aerial vehicle types creates significant challenges in understanding air traffic complexity, which may not correlate strongly with air traffic density. One key step for determining air traffic complexity in upper class E airspace is to first understand pairwise deconfliction metrics such as reachability, reserve area, and reserve flight time for each pair of unique aerial vehicle types under potential conflict. Therefore, pairwise deconfliction metrics are first defined, and analytical equations are derived for conflict resolution using the heading change maneuver. Next, case studies are performed to analyze deconfliction metrics to avoid secondary conflicts in upper class E airspace. The study shows that pairwise deconfliction metrics are functions of maneuverability, performance characteristics, uncertainty in position and velocity, heading angle change, and conflict angle of aerial vehicles. The next step for this research is to build a mathematical model for air traffic complexity using pairwise deconfliction metrics and validate it in an upper Class E simulation environment."

Often Bayesian techniques are adopted to estimate a probability density function over the model parameters given noisy empirical data. The methods used to perform this type of probabilistic calibration are computationally prohibitive in that they require a large number of evaluations of the expensive model. In these cases, surrogate modeling -- that is, using a fast-to-evaluate, lower fidelity stand-in for the original computational model -- may be the only option to alleviate this computational burden. However, the upfront cost of generating training data to build a surrogate model can itself be expensive. As such, it is important to be judicious when selecting training points at which the full-fidelity model is evaluated. Here, an active learning approach is proposed that enables efficient selection of training points using approximate samples of the calibrated parameter probability density function. In this way, the training points can be concentrated in regions where the calibration algorithm requires high model accuracy."

Unlike most other inclined debris disks imaged at visible wavelengths, the cold disk around HD 53143 appears as disconnected ""arcs"" of material, with no forward-scattering side detected to date. We present new, deeper Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph coronagraphic observations of the HD 53143 debris disk and show that the forward-scattering side of the disk remains undetected. By fitting our KLIP-reduced observations via forward modeling with an optically thin disk model, we show that fitting the visible wavelength images with an azimuthally symmetric disk with unconstrained orientation results in an unphysical edge-on orientation that is at odds with recent ALMA observations, while constraining the orientation to that observed by ALMA results in nearly isotropically scattering dust. We show that the HD 53143 host star exhibits significant stellar variations due to spot rotation and revisit age estimates for this system."

Commercial passenger and freight flight data and airport fuel consumption usage from 2016-2021 are captured from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website and the Sherlock Data Warehouse managed at NASA Ames Research Center. The resulting dataset is used to determine the miles flown by major aircraft. The corresponding aircraft fuel burn is estimated based on the International Civilian Aviation Organization fuel burn tables, and carbon dioxide emissions are calculated using a fuel-burn multiplicative factor. One conclusion of this analysis is that long-haul flights (flight distances > 2485 statute miles) create a disproportionately large amount of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S, while short flights (< 311 statute miles) contribute less than five percent of the U.S. aviation-related carbon dioxide emissions. Although these short-haul flights may not have a large impact on overall carbon dioxide emissions, they will be valuable as demonstration missions for the next generation of electric, hybrid, and hydrogen-powered vehicles and their supporting energy infrastructures.

TRAST is a generic tiltrotor testbed developed in collaboration between NASA and the Army. Ultimately, this test was a checkout of the model systems, functionality and familiarization, but also obtained subcritical whirl-flutter data in the terms of frequency and damping. Flutter data include two main configurations with different pitch spring stiffness, referred to as 4k and 8k, that were tested at various rotor speeds and airspeeds at the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The test included two modes of drivetrain operation: powered and windmilling. However, powered mode of operation was only conducted with the 8k pitch spring. This test reinforced the traditional knowledge of whirl-flutter trends such as flutter speed would decrease with an increase in rotor speed. The critical mode consistently being the wing vertical bending mode. The chord mode as expected was not affected by the pitch spring and was likely to go unstable at a tunnel airspeed slightly beyond the wing vertical bending mode. There were also test specific challenges such as the TRAST modal damping was more sensitive to temperature and amplitude motor than was expected. This test gathered valuable data on the baseline characterization of TRAST, how to improve the model and test practices for future wind tunnel testing. Additionally, a new more automated method for experimental subcritical damping determination based on the Stockwell transform has been demonstrated that may lead to more consistent whirl-flutter stability boundaries."

A diverse set of stakeholders at NASA are seeking to fund the development of concepts   of operations, medical requirements, and medical capabilities for such missions. However, a systematic approach to identification of current medical capability gaps and a strategic framework to gap closure is needed.  

OVERVIEW: The Exploration Medical Integrated Product Team (XMIPT) has developed a list of nine high-level medical capability gaps and associated activities required for gap closure. The list was derived based on inputs from subject matter experts at NASA including flight surgeons, other clinical providers, as well as operational and research communities regarding medical capabilities required to support human missions to the Moon and the Mars surface. Responses were reviewed and distilled to identify common themes across capabilities. To ensure alignment with established human system risks, the gap list was further refined based on inputs from NASA’s Human System Risk Board. Relevant medical gap closure activities outside of those funded by the XMIPT were identified through solicitation of inputs from Elements of NASA’s Human Research Program (particularly Exploration Medical Capability),  the broader medical operations community, and other stakeholders. This medical capability gap list is reviewed and updated regularly as new information becomes available or new stakeholders are identified.  

DISCUSSION: The medical capability gap list has matured to include a large group of NASA stakeholders and development activities. This has enabled articulation of priorities to funding entities and programmatic stakeholders, while serving as an accessible resource summarizing gap closure activities, relevant programmatic infusion points, and opportunities for collaboration between stakeholders. This presentation will provide an overview of   the nine NASA medical capability gaps and their associated   gap closure activities."

The reported simulations couple comprehensive rotorcraft aeromechanics and high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Aerodynamic solutions are computed on dynamic, deforming, unstructured, overset grid systems by an unsteady CFD solver, FUN3D, developed at the NASA Langley Research Center. An integrated overset-grid assembler, Yoga, is used for communications between component grids. Two turbulence models are compared for loose-coupling simulations in hover and low-speed forward flight conditions. One model is the negative variant of the one-equation Spalart-Allmaras model (SA-neg), and the other model is the SA-neg-R model adding a simple rotation correction term to the SA-neg model. It demonstrated that the rotation correction in the SA-neg-R turbulence model significantly improves resolution of secondary vortices and wake interactions for rotorcraft simulations."

This is largely due to the expansion of developed areas which allow for the trapping of heat, posing dangerous health risks. As a solution, many organizations have turned to urban greening and tree planting initiatives to help cool vulnerable communities. NASA DEVELOP has partnered with City Plants and the City of Los Angeles, Office of Forest Management to study the role of trees in urban environments and their relation to the mitigation of local urban heat islands. This team used NASA Earth observation data spanning from 2016 to 2022, including land surface temperature and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data collected from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and International Space Station (ISS) ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), respectively. Data from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) were also used to obtain a supervised classification of tree canopy cover. Our analysis reveals a spatial and temporal connection between temperature and vegetation, suggesting that areas with more vegetation are less likely to suffer high summertime temperatures. Results also highlight the impacts of tree planting programs, such as the Vermont Corridor planting project, which increased tree canopy cover by up to 5% in the community between 2016 and 2022. These findings support the implementation of urban greening practices and inform residents and officials about how investing in trees will help mitigate increasing heat within Los Angeles."

For this project, NASA DEVELOP partnered with the National Park Service (NPS) to investigate invasive species in disturbed lands: specifically, areas affected by off-trail travel and U.S.-Mexico border construction activities. The team assessed how construction has impacted the distribution of Lehmann’s lovegrass and Russian thistle invasives throughout Coronado National Memorial, AZ from 1986-2022. Using data from Landsat 5 and 8, Sentinel-2, NAIP, and PlanetScope, the team computed NDVI, NDMI, MSAVI2, EVI, and Tasseled Cap Wetness, Brightness, and Greenness transformations as vegetation health indicators to input into various machine learning algorithms. To minimize noise, the team conducted Principal Component Analysis on vegetation indices and spectral bands before running k-means clustering and random forest classification algorithms. Between all datasets, the team found that the median area fully overtaken by invasive plants was 5.37% of the park’s total area in 2022. The NPS will use end products to help increase restoration efforts in disturbed areas with high concentrations of invasive plants, and this project can serve as a jumping off point for future invasive species monitoring. The NPS’s collection of ground data for 2022-2023, in conjunction with future data collection, will notably improve the accuracy of classification models, leading to more precise monitoring of invasive species spread over time."

Capturing Micro-Behaviors in Teams,"Future long-duration space exploration (LDSE) crews will require extensive coordination, cooperation, and team functioning as they face a myriad of challenges rooted in both taskwork and teamwork (Bell et al., 2015; Landon et al., 2018). While exposed to extreme conditions, crew members must navigate living and working together in prolonged confinement. Moreover, astronaut teams are becoming increasingly diverse, introducing significant variability in team composition. This increasing diversity, alongside traditional constraints of LDSE, introduces additional challenges into effective team functioning. 

To date, most methods for capturing team functioning rely on self-report measures. Such measures are prone to several limitations, including but not limited to social desirability bias, halo effect, and leniency effects (Trull & Ebner-Priemer, 2013), which skew data and limit nuanced understandings of phenomena at play. Self-report measures broadly capture team functioning, lending the nature of such methods to identifying underlying “macro”-behaviors (i.e., behaviors that are long-standing and last over time). However, team functioning is far more complex than a series of macro-behaviors, rendering reliance on self-report data deficient for accurate measurement. 

Recent research demonstrates the potential of alternative methods for capturing team functioning, such as speech and physiological data (Chaffin et al., 2017; Murray & Oertel, 2018). Consequently, these methods are more suitable for capturing micro-behaviors: brief, often unconscious expressions that affect the extent to which an individual feels included by others around them (Paletz et al., 2013). Micro-behaviors can be further classified into micro-aggressions (i.e., subtle, negative exchanges; Keller & Galgay, 2010) or micro-affirmations (i.e., subtle, positive exchanges; Kyte et al. 2020), both of which influence team functioning.  

Due to the subtle nature of micro-behaviors, contextual factors have a significant impact when determining if it is aggressive or affirmative. Additionally, several iterations of micro-behaviors can have lingering effects on team interactions. For example, the use of “mm-hmm” by a crew member can function as both a micro-affirmation and micro-aggression. Specifically, it can be indication of active listening (i.e., micro-affirmation) or as an expression of annoyance (i.e., aggression) depending on the context in which it occurs. Auditory features (e.g., tone, frequency) can help delineate between the two forms; however, the contextual factors (e.g., previous interactions between team members, crew demographics) add a layer of complexity that render auditory features alone as insufficient to capture micro-behaviors.  

Consequently, this paper seeks to provide a novel approach in which multi-modal data (i.e., auditory features and contextual features) are used in a random-forest model to better identify distinguishing characteristics between micro-affirmations and micro-aggressions. In turn, detected micro-behaviors are used to predict team performance, thereby demonstrating the value of capturing micro-behaviors as supplemental data to macro-behaviors."

The field creates many of paths to generate information from a variety of sources. One such source is the astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS). As of now the investigation is focused on the quality of sleep of crew members during a long duration flight. Our team is investing time into a piece of hardware’s comfort, waste, and operability. The hardware was not originally designed for space; therefore, the device must be modified to function at a optimal level in space. The design not made for space has generated some ailments, such as discomfort and decreased mobility. A function of the internship was to produce designs that would manage the wires to increase mobility and comfort. The wires excess slack was reduced by the part that was designed. The piece was adjustable, so the patient may adjust the system to their comfort and space compatible material was used. This product will help control the direction and length of the wires, thereby aiding in comforting the patient. This multifaceted design may be used in future for all other wire management for wearable biomedical sensor on orbit."

The purpose of this work is to evaluate how effectively existing SFCs address the different hazards presented by a safety demonstrator operating in a wildland fire management scenario. This will help inform decision makers which SFCs would provide the most cost-effective solutions to fill the hazard gaps for further research. Hazards for the safety demonstrator wildland fire management scenario were collated, and the SFCs were evaluated for each hazard based on how applicable and effective the unmodified SFCs are at addressing the hazard. The SFCs are also evaluated for the gap type that needs to be addressed to improve the SFC effectiveness for the given hazard. The key finding of this assessment is that all the existing SFCs require at least some research and development to adapt to the safety demonstrator. No single SFC fully addresses any of the safety demonstrator operation hazards. The result of this study will be used to determine the performance of current SFCs and suggest strategies to adapt existing SFCs or add new SFCs."

Quantum networking is also advancing with multiple regional quantum networks and testbeds maturing across the nation. These quantum networking testbeds typically include multiple access points with a heterogeneous mixture of capabilities interconnected by fiber spanning anywhere from tens to hundreds of kilometers; many such networks incorporate a classical networking framework. Alongside these connectivity advancements in the infrastructure, there is quantum sensing device and component technology maturation that is serving to expand the body of quantum networking scenarios that are presently possible and redefining the quantum- enabled future. Bridging the present collective progress in quantum computing and quantum networking will enable the next era of purposeful advancements for national priority use-cases for the benefit of science. One such use-case is enabling future quantum computing applications via integrated regional quantum networking infrastructure in neighboring locations like New York and Maryland, both states are home to robust classical and quantum networking capabilities. To enable near-term distributed quantum computing applications via the practical integration of regional quantum networking infrastructure, free-space optical links via satellite communications will be essential to avoid the exponential loss commonly observed with fiber implementations. There is both an urgent need and a practical justification for pursuing such space-based integration scope now."

As progress is made, a main challenge still exists; the fuel in an NTP system must survive the extreme environment experienced during operating conditions. Three fuel forms have been studied including a ceramic-metallic matrix, a ceramic-ceramic matrix, and solid solution carbides. Solid solution carbides were studied previously as a fuel for NTP and was shown to be a promising technology; however, the programs were canceled before demonstration in an NTP engine test. Of the refractory metal carbides of interest, zirconium carbide (ZrC), niobium carbide (NbC) and tantalum carbide (TaC) were studied. ZrC, NbC, and TaC powders were consolidated in monocarbide (ZrC, NbC, TaC) and bi-carbide (ZrC-NbC, ZrC-TaC, NbC-TaC) forms using spark plasma sintering (SPS), with 50-50 mol% compositions of the bi-carbides of interest. The time and temperature conditions to achieve a completely homogeneous solid solution for the mixed carbides is of interest for NTP fuel applications, since this homogeneity is considered to be essential for this fuel form.  Homogeneity is typically not achieved during sintering, as surface diffusion (predominant for sintering to near ideal density) tends to occur at lower temperatures than bulk volumetric diffusion (required for solute interdiffusion to achieve a homogeneous solid solution). High temperature isochronal annealing was performed to identify the conditions to achieve a chemically homogeneous sample. The solute interpenetration vs annealing temperature was quantified using energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to accurately measure the phase stability and lattice parameter as a function of annealing conditions. The diffusion data from each sample was then used to determine self-diffusion coefficients for interdiffusion of the Nb, Zr, and Ta solutes and compared to existing literature values. The minimum annealing conditions to achieve complete chemical homogeneity for each carbide was determined."

We are evaluating epifluorescence microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as rapid, accurate, and cost-effective methods to complement other contamination detection techniques. This study is part of a larger effort to characterize background organic contamination and the efficacy of cleaning procedures in Johnson Space Center (JSC) Astromaterials Curation Laboratories and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) spacecraft assembly rooms. The low level of biomass required careful use of blanks during each stage of sample collection and preparation. FISH was performed using general archaeal and bacterial probes, as well as some group-specific probes. While some active bacteria were identified, a large majority of them were dead or inactive, and thus were difficult to identify by standard FISH. Our results are consistent with other studies that show that the bioburden present in clean rooms includes active, dormant, and dead cells."

Specifically, this paper compares the results of a Bayesian MLR model with a fixed slope to one with a random slope using WSPR and QSF18 data. Previously reported dose-response modeling efforts of WSPR and QSF18 data have used a MLR model with a fixed slope term. A random slope may more accurately depict the dose-response relationship of individuals in the efforts to produce a population summary dose-response curve. Results of a fixed versus random slope model with WSPR and QSF18 data indicate minimal difference between the modeling methods. The simpler fixed slope model is preferable for these data, but these results do not preclude consideration of a random slope term in modeling efforts of future X-59 community test data."

The heat exchanger transfers heat from the ventilation gas to the thermal control loop via a miniature shell-and-tube heat exchanger.  The flow meters calculate the flow rate of gas through the ventilation loop based on the pressure drop across the heat exchanger core.  Creare has delivered four design validation test (DVT) heat exchangers and five DVT flow meters to NASA JSC to support development of the exploration portable life support system (xPLSS). This paper describes the design and performance of the DVT units.The heat exchangers are designed to cool the ventilation gas to a specified temperature with low pressure losses under the most challenging operating conditions.  The measured performance of the DVT heat exchangers agrees well with design models and meets all performance requirements. The flow meters use a MEMS thermal flow sensor to produce a signal that is proportional to a small bypass flow around the heat exchanger core.  They are designed to achieve high measurement accuracy across the full range of xPLSS operating conditions.  We calibrated the flow meters in a special-purpose flow facility that simulates operation in the xPLSS ventilation loop.  Calibration testing shows that DVT flow meters produce digital output for vent loop mass flow that meets NASA’s accuracy requirements across the range of xPLSS operating conditions. This paper reviews the design of the heat exchangers and flow meters and presents data from the final flow meter calibration testing, heat exchanger performance validation, and initial ground testing in NASA’s xPLSS."

The study is aimed at enhanced lift over the practical angle of attack range, including stall, and at reduced drag. These benefits translate to airplane performance improvements, such as longer range or larger payload. Various flow control applications were explored using Computational Fluid Dynamics and the aerodynamic performance enhancements were benchmarked against the baseline configuration. The computational analyses are used to quantify aerodynamic benefits, as well as the input required for actuation. The results were used in a system integration study for identifying potential practical implementations, which are described in a companion paper. Combined with the integration analysis, the objective of this project is to identify the most promising flow control candidates that potentially provide material net airplane level enhancements using onboard fluidic sources.

State of the Art (SOA) radiators were design for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations where Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and dust have miniscule performance impacts. However, Artemis missions to the lunar orbit or surface will expose the radiators to high dose UV radiation and dust, which can degrade the radiator coating emissivity by up to 50% and consequently reduce performance early in missions. In addition, environmental nighttime temperatures at the lunar south pole are significantly colder and linger longer than LEO, and may require up to 4 kW of heater power to prevent coolant tubes from freezing, thawing, and rupturing. Analysis showed equipping the radiators with actively controlled louvers attenuated the UV radiation and dust effects, and limited degradation to less than 10% through End of Life (EOL) of missions. Furthermore, analysis demonstrated the ability to eliminate the heater power needed for freeze protection. Louver technology is a promising solution to maintain radiator performance and integrity for Artemis missions, but heritage louvers are passively controlled and only been used on small satellites. The technology requires maturing to active control, or motor actuated, to achieve faster thermal response times. Design considerations are discussed in this paper."

Successful performance modeling methods exist for a wide range of traditional aircraft designs. However, comparable modeling methods appropriate for UAM vehicles that combine fixed-wing and rotorcraft performance have not yet been established. One challenge to progress has been the lack of available data capturing the performance characteristics and unique flight profiles of these aircraft. This paper describes methods used to generate the required performance data and the development of performance models for UAM vehicles. Included is a review of the energy and power equations often used in developing performance models for traditional aircraft as well as a discussion of their applicability to UAM vehicles. The challenge of generating realistic performance data in over-actuated vehicles transitioning from hover to cruise flight is also addressed through an approach based on objective function optimization. A table-based performance model format adapted to UAM configurations is described, as well as parametric models intended to accompany the performance table to allow detailed modeling of power and fuel consumption during accelerated flight, turning flight, or flight at an arbitrary climb or descent rate.

The analytical expressions show that the minimum temporal separation is a function of the length and width of operational volume blocks, the relative positions of the active operational volume blocks, groundspeed of unmanned aircraft, and the incoming crossing angle. Next, the parametric study shows that the impact of the incoming crossing angle on the minimum temporal separation at a crossing waypoint increases with an increase in the width of the operational volume blocks. Finally, simulation studies are performed to understand the impact of operational volume block sizing, on-demand departure rate, minimum departure time separation, and the incoming crossing angle on the average ground delay of unmanned aircraft traveling on two routes with a single crossing waypoint and identical on-demand departure rate. Each unmanned aircraft’s estimated time of arrival at a crossing waypoint is adjusted by introducing a ground delay in departure time; no other controls (e.g., speed adjustments) are applied for strategic deconfliction. Simulation studies show that the impact of the minimum temporal separation at a crossing waypoint on the average ground delay of flights is negligible if the minimum departure time separation is at least two times the minimum temporal separation. Therefore, with an increase in minimum departure time separation at a depot, the impact of increased length of operational volume blocks enclosing the crossing waypoint on the ground delay is offset to an extent."

However, recently, thermoplastics have been investigated for use in the manufacturing of composite
materials due to their unique manufacturing characteristics. Thermoplastic resins can be reshaped and
formed, along with the added benefit of being recyclable, which thermoset resin cannot. Thermoplastic
materials undergo a crystallization process during manufacturing which affects the percent crystallinity of the material. The crystallization needs to be understood better to maximize the potential of thermoplastic resins. PEKK is a thermoplastic material with good chemical, thermal, and mechanical loading resistance. PEKK is also a material NASA is interested in for developing new bonded joint technology. The crystalline microstructure of PEKK is at the micrometer length scale, and it is of interest to model the effects of the crystallinity structure on PEKK’s bulk properties. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a simulation tool that allows for property-structure relationships between atomistic structure and nanometer-length portions of a material. This makes MD a useful tool for developing the structure-property relationship of PEKK. However, the micrometer length scale of PEKK’s crystal structure is too large for MD. Thus, a hybrid approach to modeling PEKK’s microstructure is proposed in this work where MD models are built of both the amorphous and crystalline phases of PEKK. The engineering material properties can be obtained using MD at the nanometer length scale. A micromechanics approach can then generate the micrometer length scale of the crystallinity and the effective properties can be homogenized. The objective of this paper is to show the MD model workflow and the MD-predicted properties of PEKK. The properties can then be homogenized with different crystalline percentages to build design graphs that can be used to tailor PEKK for specific composite applications."

This allows us to analyze the evolution of the events, from the erupting prominences low in the
corona to the corresponding CMEs high in the corona. We also study the changes in the global magnetic field before and after the eruptions and the magnetic field configuration at the site of the eruptions using magnetic field extrapolation methods.

AOS addresses the Decadal Survey’s call for missions measuring the targeted observables “clouds, convection, and precipitation”; “aerosol and cloud radiative properties”, and “aerosol vertical profiles”.  AOS is currently in Phase A, the concept and technology development phase, with plans for satellite launches in the late 2020’s and early 2030’s, and suborbital measurements to include field campaigns after those satellite launches.  Key precipitation-related instrumentation includes Doppler radars capable of measuring clouds and precipitation, and passive microwave radiometers with channels between 89-700 GHz. Other instrumentation includes dual-wavelength backscatter lidars, a multi-wavelength and multi-angle polarimeter, a far infrared imaging radiometer, and aerosol and moisture limb sounders that will contribute to studies of coupled aerosol-cloud-precipitation processes. 

From the perspective of precipitation science, a Ku-band Doppler radar in a 55° inclined orbit provided by JAXA will continue the heritage of precipitation radar measurements made by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM), while adding information about Doppler-derived particle vertical motions. With assumptions about particle terminal velocities, the Doppler measurements will enable estimates of the vertical air motion in storms. A higher frequency (W and/or Ka band) radar on a satellite in a polar sun-synchronous orbit will add similar information with greater sensitivity to clouds and to light precipitation. Passive microwave radiometers for AOS will be less capable than those from TRMM and GPM from a precipitation-measurement perspective, but more capable of adding information about cloud processes. Synergies among these and other instruments are expected to advance process-level understanding of aerosols, clouds, and precipitation."

Developing accurate models of two-phase flow phenomena, particularly flow boiling in the heating configuration is relevant to the propellant transfer process both in microgravity and on other planetary surfaces. Currently there is a need for more accurate, direct cryogenic data anchored models for various boiling phenomena. Recently, universal correlations for cryogens flowing in heated tubes have been developed for a wide variety of fluids, thermodynamic conditions, and various regimes across the boiling curve, and have been patched to provide a smooth, continuous predictive curve. This paper demonstrates how these correlations have been ported into Thermal Desktop to improve predictive performance. To test the validity of the new correlations, Thermal Desktop is validated against a historical dataset of flow boiling experiments in the heating configuration using liquid helium. Based on results, the new correlations show a substantial improvement over the original built-in flow boiling correlations in Thermal Desktop in predicting the wall temperature as a function of preponderant parameters for this quantum fluid."

This suit design allows crewmembers to perform extravehicular exploration, science, construction, maintenance, and contingency operations while unattached to a vehicle for life support in pressure and thermal environments that exceed human capability. The xEMU provides life support, environmental protection, and communications capabilities to the EVA crewmember while allowing sufficient mobility and visibility to perform dexterous EVA tasks. The effort documented in this paper, addressed the design, analysis, manufacturing, full-scale test article testing and validation for a Composite Hard Upper Torso(CHUT)unit. Design and analysis of the CHUT was based on measured B-basis properties of the selected S-glass/epoxy composite, and established final geometry, composite layup and interface details that met requirements. A complete manufacturing and assembly protocol was established for the CHUT starting from composite layup in the tool, to final assembly of all interface metal hardware prior to delivery to NASA for suit integration. Full-scale CHUT test articles underwent static and fatigue pressure testing (2 lifetimes), impact testing at critical stress locations for tool drop/microgravity scenarios, followed by post-impact fatigue testing. Effect of manufacturing defects was evaluated by manufacturing a full-scale CHUT with 0.375”/0.5” defects at critical stress locations, followed by static and life-cycle fatigue testing. In all cases, the CHUT design met or exceeded mass, structural, interface and functional requirements. Two (2) complete CHUT articles were delivered to NASA for full-scale suit integration and testing."

The compiled data are compared with widely used correlations.

Experimental pool boiling CHF data for the aforementioned cryogens are scarce. Based on only 25 data points found in five independent sources, the correlation of Sun and Lienhard (1970) is recommended for predicting the pool CHF of LH2. Only two experiments with useful CHF data for the pool boiling of LCH4 could be found. Four different correlations including the correlation of Lurie and Noyes (1964) can predict the pool boiling CHF of LCH4 within a factor of two for more than 70% of the data. Furthermore, based on the 19 data points taken from only two available sources, the correlation of Sun and Lienhard (1970) is recommended for the prediction of pool CHF of LO2.

Flow boiling CHF data for LH2 could be found in seven experimental studies, five of them from the same source.  Based on the 91 data points, it is suggested that the correlation of Katto and Ohno (1984) be used to predict the flow CHF of LH2. No useful data could be found for flow boiling CHF of LCH4 or LO2. The available databases for flow boiling of LCH4 and LO2 are generally deficient in all boiling regimes. This deficiency is particularly serious with respect to flow boiling."

A unique design feature of these chambers is the gaseous helium cryopumping panels within the liquid nitrogen shroud. This shroud is used to bring the chamber to cryogenic temperatures while the cryopumping panels trap gasses using their large surface area in order to create a high vacuum environment of 5*10^-6 Torr.
	In preparation for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) flight test, a series of functionals required the chamber to run at higher temperatures, and therefore did not need active cooling from the liquid nitrogen shroud. During testing, cryopumping panels were used to mitigate contamination during this main shroud warm-up. One of the cryopumping panels in Chamber A was covered with several layers of aluminized mylar in order to thermally protect the zone from the warmed shroud. This strategy was effective and became part of operations during JWST testing.
	Currently, Chamber B has requests for both commercial and NASA space suit tests at both high and low temperatures to accurately generate thermal models. High temperature tests would greatly benefit from simultaneous shroud warming and the high vacuum environment provided by the cryopumping panels. This report will perform a thermal analysis to judge the feasibility of adding layers of aluminized mylar to the cryopumping panels of Chamber B."

A new software suite was constructed which can compute lineloads rapidly enough that the calculations can run in tandem with high-fidelity fluid flow solvers. This enables the calculation of iteration- or time-dependent lineloads, which have thus far been too computationally costly to create for complicated systems like launch vehicles. The suite is organized into a standalone Python module named PCLAM (PCLAM Computes Lineloads And Moments) which can be imported into other software with minimal restructuring by the user or developer. The computed lineloads are integrated with a $C^0$ numerical quality and exhibit the expected sensitivity to underlying grid resolution.

With the increasingly rapid emergence and utilization of new technologies and systems of increasing complexity, ensuring safety becomes more difficult. The technology and practice/applications of safety/risk technologies require updating in concert with capability and systems technology changes. Hence the new, updated edition of this risk engineering book. Major changes in technology and applications, now and going forward, increasingly involve artificial intelligence (AI)/autonomy and complex systems, which are rapidly developing and moving targets when it comes to risk/safety analysis. These introduce both new risks and safety issues, and they alter more usual ones. The current reality is that often the best AI is when it is “Black Boxed”, developed “independently”, without detailed human understanding of how and by what processes decisions and results are produced. There are ongoing efforts to make the AI processes more understandable by humans, with results to be determined. Also, trusted and true autonomy is free of human intervention, which would require machines to ideate to solve in real time issues that arise due to unknown unknowns and even known unknowns. Machines using generative adversarial network (GANs) and other approaches are beginning to ideate. Overall, the capabilities and practice of AI/autonomy utilization is a work in progress with the rate of progress substantial and the impacts upon system risk/safety major."

These criteria are particularly important in space communication. Increasing mission complexity and crowding of lower frequency bands is driving the need for optical communications. This makes FSO communication technology extremely attractive, and there is significant ongoing work towards the development of FSO transceivers, ground stations, and relays. Notable projects include the Laser Communications Relay Demonstrator (LCRD), Integrated LCRD Low-Earth Orbit User Modem and Amplifier Terminal (ILLUMA-T), and CubeSat Laser Infrared Crosslink (CLICK) CubeSats. These technologies will eventually operate in unison with existing Radio Frequency (RF) systems, but there is little experimental investigation of such hybrid networks. This paper presents some experimental underpinnings of switching strategies for hybrid RF/FSO systems in various attenuation conditions. A 170 m optical path was constructed in an enclosed test chamber where atmospheric conditions can be tightly controlled. The performance of a 1550 nm infrared FSO link was evaluated in this chamber under varying conditions of turbulence and jitter. The system will eventually be used to investigate switching criteria between the FSO and RF channels. Optimizing the use of RF/FSO communication links will allow data rate, size, power, and security improvements.

A 1.62%-scale model of the aircraft was fabricated for the wind tunnel test, which took place in the NASA Glenn 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel in September and October 2021. The model had provisions for being mounted by a swept blade strut that attached at top of model ahead of the inlet, or by a rear-entry sting that held the model at the location of the nacelle. The model had alternate parts for ±0.5° deflections of the flaps, ailerons, and stabilator, and ±1° deflections of the T-tail. Off-body static pressure measurements of the flow field below the model were made on a pressure rail which had 420 orifices along its tip. The model was positioned at various heights from the rail by vertical movement of the tunnel strut, and at various longitudinal stations relative to the rail by means of a linear actuator mounted between the wind tunnel strut and the balance. Spatial averaging of model pressure signatures acquired over a range of longitudinal positions reduced the effects of tunnel flow distortions and the interference of the rail flow field and shocks on the model pressure signatures. The test was run at approximate Mach numbers of 1.36, 1.4, and 1.47, and the model was set at various angles of attack and roll relative to the rail. Plots of the model signatures for representative variations of Mach number, model angles, control deflections, and height relative to the rail are provided throughout the report. Repeatability was generally very good and gave confidence in the quality of the measurements. The signatures measured at various heights from the rail provided insight into the aging of the model shocks as they propagated from 1.2 to 3 body lengths from the model. Off-track signatures up to 45° from centerline obtained by rolling the model gave indications of the shock flow fields across the width of the sonic boom carpet. The deflections of the various control surfaces allowed assessment of the boom sensitivity to the control surface movements."

The tower loading revealed a strong impact of the SLS vehicle height on force coefficients for individual tiers. Although the umbilicals produced weak influence on the loading on both vehicle and launch tower, unsteady pressure measurements revealed a slight increase in fundamental pressure oscillation frequency at specific wind azimuth directions. Multimodal flow states were observed in the gap flow between the vehicle and solid rocket boosters, producing different load profiles along the vehicle that are now incorporated in the vehicle database. This phenomenon was investigated using time-series measurements of forces as well as tufts and smoke flow visualization."

This requires understanding the nature of the outflows and the physical transitions through the middle corona (∼1.5–6.0 Rs). While this region is still inaccessible to in situ measurements, remote sensing observations are available, but their interpretation can be controversial due to line-of-sight effects and the nonradial motion of outflowing structures close to the Sun (≤3.0 Rs). In this work, we describe a method to mitigate these challenges by generating nonradial height–time profiles of outflows by using advanced image processing techniques. The northern and southern boundaries of a large equatorial streamer during the 2008 solar minimum were identified in STEREO/SECCHI solar images, using two different methodologies based on thresholds of brightness and piecewise polynomial function fitting. To address line-of-sight issues, we used tomographic reconstruction of the 3D distribution of the coronal electron density based on SECCHI/COR2 images. Spectral analysis of the time series of the position angle of the streamer boundary revealed its oscillatory nature at some heights at 36–48 and 10.5–14.6 hr. Dividing the distance between the northern and southern streamer boundaries in equal parts at each height, we obtained nonradial height–time paths from which we generated nonradial profiles of corona/solar wind plasma outflow. We tracked outflows as they moved uninterruptedly from the Sun in EUVI, through COR1 and into COR2. Finally, we discuss the preliminary results of nonradial plane-of-sky velocities for a coronal mass ejection and two small-scale features."

The test objectives were to assess the safety, efficiency, passenger comfort and noise of the different variations of the developmental IFPs. Safety-related measures include clearance from terrain and vertical obstructions, procedure flyability, and flight path conformance. Efficiency-related measures included time required, airspace volume required, and battery energy required. Passenger comfort and ride quality measures include roll/pitch angles, roll/pitch attitude change rates, and airspeeds prior to aggressive maneuvers, subjective pilot/passenger responses and acceleration forces. The noise impacts of the different IFPs will be interpolated/extrapolated using data from the simulator fed into a separate Joby acoustic software-based tool. Overall, several tradeoffs were identified and characterized between the different variations of the developmental IFP profiles. No single version of the developmental IFP structure scored highest across all measures listed above; rather, different IFP variations proved optimal for different measures, confirming that the best IFP depends on which specific measures are prioritized for a given aircraft, location and operation."

This includes capabilities that capitalize on existing lunar resources and carry out surface manufacturing and construction activities. The goal of the Moon-to-Mars Planetary Construction Technology (MMPACT) Project is to mature these two capabilities. 
The primary resource on the Moon and the primary feedstock for manufacturing and construction is regolith. In the past, astronauts launched, landed, and lived in a spacecraft. NASA envisions a future where we make living spaces on the lunar surface instead. The innovative technologies required for lunar surface construction may be something never seen before, or they may be adaptations of existing technologies. MMPACT must screen for the most feasible technologies with the earliest potential technology insertions given the ambitious goals of the Artemis campaign. This poster summarizes recent efforts to discover and document mechanical and thermal capabilities of various technologies: a laser-based vitreous material transformation from Texas-based ICON, a molten extrusion process from ICON, a mortar from MSFC, a mortar from an MSFC-Louisiana State University partnership, and a geopolymer from a MSFC-Pennsylvania State University partnership. Other testing and development activities are documented as well.

These AM techniques reduce hardware cost, shorten fabrication schedules, increase reliability by reducing the number of joints, and improve hardware performance by allowing unconventional design. The RAMFIRE project, funded under Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Game Changing Development (GCD) Program, has furthered the use of novel AM liquid rocket nozzles in collaboration with Elementum 3D. The project advanced novel large-scale AM aluminum material technology for significant weight savings in rocket engines and launch vehicles. Previously, aluminum alloys were difficult to weld and print using additive manufacturing. Elementum 3D’s patented Aluminum 6061-RAM2 alloy allows for aluminum alloys to be printed using various AM techniques and at various scales. The alloy can be leveraged for welding wire, showing drastic improvements in aluminum weldability. The RAMFIRE project focuses on five key areas: 1) Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition (LP-DED) AL6061-RAM2 feedstock specification and verification, 2) LP-DED process development and validation, 3) LP-DED printed AL6061-RAM2 microstructural and mechanical property characterization, 4) Hot-fire test a 7k-lbf thrust class regeneratively cooled nozzle, 5) Print large scale regeneratively cooled nozzle. Hot-fire testing demonstrates potential of advanced space technologies to NASA and potential users by providing the relevant environments to advance TRL levels to the 5/6 range."

On the Antarctic ice sheet, winds redistribute snow resulting in surface mass balance that is variable in both space and time. Representing wind-driven snow redistribution processes in models is critical for local assessments of surface mass balance, repeat altimetry studies, and interpretation of ice core accumulation records. To this end, we have adapted Alpine3D, an existing distributed snow modeling framework, to downscale Antarctic surface mass balance to horizontal resolutions up to 1 km. In particular, we have introduced a new two-dimensional advection-based wind-driven snow redistribution module that is driven by an offline coupling between WindNinja, a wind downscaling model, and Alpine3D. We then show that large accumulation variability can be at least partially explained by terrain-induced wind speed variations which subsequently redistribute snow around rolling topography. By comparing Alpine3D to airborne-derived snow accumulation measurements within a testing domain over Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica, we demonstrate that our Alpine3D downscaling approach improves surface mass balance estimates when compared to MERRA-2, a global atmospheric reanalysis which we use as atmospheric forcing. In particular, when compared to MERRA-2, Alpine3D reduces simulated surface mass balance root mean squared error by 23.4 mm w.e.yr−1 (13%) and increases variance explained by 24%. Despite these improvements, Alpine3D still underestimates observed accumulation variability, thus providing an opportunity for future model improvement."

The correlations improve upon prior correlations that were developed separately for liquid nitrogen (LN2) and liquid hydrogen (LH2) pipe quenching datasets. The new correlations include equations to calculate the single-phase vapor heat transfer, film boiling heat transfer, transition boiling heat transfer, nucleate boiling heat transfer, single-phase liquid heat transfer, bulk vapor temperature during high quality film boiling, Leidenfrost temperature, critical heat flux, critical heat flux temperature, and the onset of nucleate boiling temperature. The correlations were validated against LH2, LN2, liquid methane, liquid oxygen, and liquid argon pipe quenching datasets. The eight datasets cover the following parameter ranges: pipe lengths of 0.1 to 6.5m; outer pipe diameters of 12.7 to 25.4 mm; pipe wall thicknesses from 0.51 to 1.64 mm; flow directions of upward, downward, and horizontal; gravity levels of 1g and 0g±0.01g. A numerical model assumes homogeneous mixing between the vapor and liquid and implicitly integrates the coupled energy equations for the pipe and fluid, as well as continuity for the fluid. The model was used to estimate the equilibrium quality and fluid mass accumulation along the pipes during chilldown from estimates of the fluid-pipe heat transfer extracted from temperature measurements. The correlations can be implemented in lumped parameter codes such as SINDA/FLUINT and the Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) to improve the accuracy of chilldown time and chilldown boiloff mass predictions. Such predictions are useful for designing ground or in-space cryogenic liquid transfer systems."

But guaranteeing vapor-free transfer of such low-surface tension liquids is difficult for traditional capillary-action propellant management devices (PMDs). Screen-channel liquid acquisition devices and compliant origami bladders are potential solutions, but to quantify the benefits these technologies offer, this paper present a cast study analyzing the performance metrics of an orthodox vane PMD as a benchmark for comparison. A 0.15 m3 liquid hydrogen tank at 20.3 K and 103 kPa was selected for study. Then assuming no body forces and no heat transfer (for simplicity), a steady-state 1-D differential equation was numerically solved in tandem with four possible wetted area configurations to yield an expulsion efficiency for a theoretically maximum inputted expulsion flow rate. Maximization of the flow rate was constrained by the onset of choked flow. Additional inputs, including vane height and vane number, were parametrically varied between 0.1 – 10 cm and 4 – 28 vanes, respectively."

During the Cryogenic Fluid In-situ Liquefaction for Landers (CryoFILL) testing, an opportunity arose to compare liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen behavior using the same test hardware in similar test conditions. Comparative testing would verify whether the system response to nitrogen and oxygen would behave in a similar manner. Tests that were investigated include system boil-off heat load determination, autogenous pressurization, cryocooler loop initiation, and cryocooler loop operations. Results from testing are shown and compared to verify that liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen tests yield similar system responses, and that nitrogen can be used as a substitute for oxygen in developmental tests at cryogenic temperatures."

Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has been developing a hybrid thermal control system that can be utilized for various surface assets that must survive in extreme lunar environments. This scalable system is targeted for human-rated systems and utilizes a combination of a- pumped fluid loop (PFL) and a loop heat pipe (LHP) with thermal control valve (TCV). Pumped fluid loops have a long history of use in human rated systems. They can collect large amounts of waste heat and transport it over long distances in rovers, habitats, and other systems. By utilizing a non-toxic working fluid in the habitable volume, the PFL is easily serviceable by the crew and does not pose a risk during any unexpected leaks or failures. The addition of a LHP for the exterior heat transport and rejection adds several benefits to the system for extreme environment survival. The quantity of LHP scan be tailored to optimize heat rejection for different systems and allows for larger adiative surfaces. By utilizing a TCV in combination with the LHP, there can be high heat transfer during the daytime with minimal heat transfer during the night. The TCV passively controls the amount of heat transfer through the LHP based on the environmental temperature. A prototype system has been tested in bench top and thermal vacuum conditions. Results are presented showing the feasibility of the system concept."

Here we use the Old World Drought Atlas (OWDA), a tree-ring based reconstruction of the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI), to examine this wetting trend and place it in a longer hydroclimatic context. We find that scPDSI variability in northwestern Europe is strongly correlated with the leading mode of the OWDA during the last millennium (1000–2012). This leading mode, here named the ‘English Channel’ (EC) mode, has pronounced variability on interannual to centennial timescales and has an expression in scPDSI similar to that of the East Atlantic teleconnection pattern. A shift in the EC mode from a prolonged negative phase to more neutral conditions during the 19th and 20th centuries is associated with the wetting trend over its area of influence in England, Wales, and much of northern continental Europe. The EC mode is the dominant scPDSI mode from approximately 1000–1850, after which its dominance waned in favor of the secondary ‘North–South’ (NS) mode, which has an expression in scPDSI similar to that of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We examine the dynamical nature of both of these modes and how they vary on interannual to centennial timescales. Our results provide insight into the nature of hydroclimate variability in Europe before the widespread availability of instrumental observations."

The focus of this TFG was to assess the current capabilities of WMLES and Lattice-Boltzmann methods on a complex high-lift configuration across a wide range of angles ofattack. Preliminary analysis of the submitted data suggests that>250𝑀spatial degrees offreedom are needed to accurately predict pitching moments at high angles-of-attack due tolarge pressure gradients present on the outboard slat and main element for𝛼 >17◦(correctedfor free-air). While some scatter is reported in pitching moment coefficient at the low-angles ofattack (𝛼 <11◦) - likely caused by differences in flap separation possibly due to low Reynoldsnumber effects - excellent agreement is observed between the submissions near the𝐶𝐿,maxstate.Objective superiority of WMLES methods over steady state RANS can be seen in terms of lack ofexcess outboard separation; a majority of the good quality WMLES and LB submissions predictwedge-shaped separation patterns consistent with the experimental oil flow. Differences in theonset of stall mechanism in the free-air configuration for𝛼 >20◦is reported with two distincttopologies observed.

Topology B is characterized by boundary layer weakness emanatingfrom the inboard side of the wing-pylon juncture substantially larger than any weakness in thewing-body juncture (due to corner-flow); submissions in this category do not show any tendencyfor occurrence of a pitch break for the free-air configuration within the vicinity of𝛼=21.47◦.The in-tunnel simulations submitted by 3 participants using different discretizations, grids andclosure models show excellent agreement with the experiment in terms of a) integrated loads,b) surface flow-topology, and c) mechanism for the onset of inboard stall.

In 2013 alone, around 60% of the total spacecraft launched had a mass under 600 kg, and of those under 600 kg, 83% were under 200 kg and 37% were nanosatellites (1). Of the total 1,849 spacecraft launched in 2021, 94% were small spacecraft with an overall mass under 600 kg, and of those under 600 kg, 40% were under 200 kg, and 11% were nanosatellites (1). Since 2013, the fight heritage for small spacecraft has increased by over 30% and has become the primary source to space access for commercial, government, private, and academic institutions. The total number of spacecraft launched in the past 10 years is 5,681 and 45% of those had a mass.

As with all previous editions of this report, the 2022 edition captures and distills a wealth of new information available on small spacecraft systems from NASA and other publicly available sources. This report is limited to publicly available information and cannot reflect major advances in development that are not publicly disclosed. We encourage any opportunity to publish mission outcomes and technology development milestones (e.g., via conference papers, press releases, company website) so they can be reflected in this report. Overall, this report is a survey of small spacecraft technologies sourced from open literature; it does not endeavor to be an original source, and only considers literature in the public domain to identify and classify devices. Commonly used sources for data include manufacturer datasheets, press releases, conference papers, journal papers, public filings with government agencies, news articles, presentations, the compendium of databases accessed via NASA’s Small Spacecraft Systems Virtual Institute (S3VI) Information Search, and engagement with companies. Data not appropriate for public dissemination, such as proprietary, export controlled, or otherwise restricted data, are not considered. As a result, this report includes many dedicated hours of desk research performed by subject matter experts reviewing resources noted above. Content in this 2022 edition is based on data available by October 2022. This report should not be considered as a comprehensive overview of all the technologies but a great reference for the current state-of-the-art SmallSat technologies.

The organizational approach for each chapter is relatively consistent with previous editions and includes an introduction of the technology, current development status of the technology’s procurable systems, and summary tables of technologies surveyed. The content in each chapter is uniquely organized to present a mini-stand-alone report on spacecraft subsystems. As in previous years, chapters include information from previous editions but are updated with new and maturating technologies and reference missions. Tables in each section provide a convenient summary of the technologies discussed, with explanations and references in the body text. The authors have attempted to isolate trends in the small spacecraft industry to point out which technologies have been adopted after successful demonstration missions. Lastly, the authors tried to use the terms “SmallSat,” “microsatellite,” “nanosatellite,” and “CubeSat” in a consistent manner, even as these terms are often used interchangeably in the space industry.

Every subsystem chapter contains updated information to reflect the growth in the small spacecraft market. Significant changes are included in several chapters. The “Complete Spacecraft Platforms” chapter now includes information on the two main market options, hosted payload services and dedicated buses. The “Power” chapter provides information on the development of solid-state batteries with significantly higher energy than the current state-of-theart lithium-ion batteries. A large effort was made to update the “Communications” chapter to appropriately capture the recent technology maturation of optical communications for SmallSats. The “Ground Data Systems and Mission Operations” chapter was updated to reflect the recent establishment of the Near Space Network and influx of SmallSat Optical Ground Stations. The “Guidance, Navigation and Control” chapter was updated to include Lidar sensor technology. The “Deorbit Systems” chapter includes a discussion of recently proposed changes by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to limit a spacecraft’s lifetime to no longer than 5 years after end-of-mission. The “Identification and Tracking” Chapter includes updated information on the progress of SmallSat tracking. Finally, this report now encompasses technology funded by NASA’s Small Spacecraft Technology (SST) program’s SmallSat Technology Partnerships (STP) initiative which is described further in this Introduction. The reader can find the included SST technology in the “On the Horizon” section of the “Thermal Systems”, “Communications”, and “Guidance, Navigation, and Control” chapters.

A central element of this report is to list state-of-the-art technologies by NASA standard Technology Readiness Level (TRL) as defined by the 2020 NASA Engineering Handbook, found in NASA NPR 7123.1C NASA Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements. The authors have endeavored to independently verify the TRL value of each technology by reviewing and citing published test results or publicly available data to the best of their ability. Where test results and data disagree with vendors’ own advertised TRL, the authors have attempted to engage the vendors to discuss the discrepancy. Readers are strongly encouraged to follow the references cited in the literature describing the full performance range and capabilities of each technology. Readers of this report should reach out to individual companies to further clarify information. It is important to note that this report takes a broad system-level view. To attain a high TRL, the subsystem must be in a flight-ready configuration with all supporting infrastructure—such as mounting points, power conversion, and control algorithms—in an integrated unit.

An accurate TRL assessment requires a high degree of technical knowledge on a subject device, and an in-depth understanding of the mission (including interfaces and environment) on which the device was flown. There is variability in TRL values depending on design factors for a specific technology. For example, differences in TRL assessment based on the operating environment may result from the thermal environment, mechanical loads, mission duration, or radiation exposure. If a technology has flown on a mission without success, or without providing valid confirmation to the operator, such claimed “flight heritage” was discounted. The authors believe TRLs are most accurately determined when assessed within the context of a program’s unique requirements.

While the overall capability of small spacecraft has matured since the 2021 edition of this report, technologies are still being developed to make deep space SmallSat missions more routine and more cost effective. 

Future editions of this report may include content dedicated to the rapidly growing fields of assembly, integration, and testing services, and mission modeling and simulation–all of which are now extensively represented at small spacecraft conferences. Many of these subsystems and services are still in their infancy, but as they evolve and reliable conventions and standards emerge, the next iteration of this report may also evolve to include additional chapters."

Numerically controlled electrical discharge machining (EDM) has progressed to commonly be used as a machining process for initial sectioning, detailed roughing, and even some finishing operations. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of EDM on resulting surface conditions of superalloy 718 after slicing using typical rough, semi-finish, and finish condition sets with a typical wire EDM machine. Surface roughness, residual stress, and microstructures were compared for these conditions. The varied EDM conditions influenced surface roughness as intended. The residual stresses and surface roughness directly corresponding to the EDM steps were determined. While roughness decreased when progressing from rough to finish EDM conditions, tensile residual stresses unexpectedly increased. Brief assessments after EDM of two higher performance powder metallurgy disk superalloys ME209 and LSHR indicated this inverse relationship of roughness versus tensile residual stress was also present for these superalloys, where tensile residual stresses were significantly enhanced."

The process is time-consuming both in preparation and for analysis upon return 6-12 months later. Badges also require precious crew time for deploy, retrieval and stow. As NASA’s focus in space exploration shifts to the Moon and Mars, archival sample return becomes increasingly impractical, so the aim of this project is to develop a highly reliable real-time analyzer for H2CO at low concentrations with data downlinked. Potential sources of H2CO include materials off gassing, use of formalin as a tissue fixative in biological payloads and overheating of acetal polymers. The Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentration (SMAC) for H2CO is 100 ppb for exposures of 7 days or longer. ISS concentrations recently run only 10 - 30 ppb but have spiked as high as 60 ppb in the past. Gateway real time monitoring requirements call for a range of 8 - 140 ppb. For this project, a concentration range of 5 - 500 ppb H2CO is targeted. The core tunable diode laser spectroscopy (TDLS) technology was developed by Vista Photonics through the NASA and US Navy Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs. Monitors based on this technology have been demonstrated on ISS, trialed on a nuclear submarine and are in production as Anomaly Gas Analyzers for both ISS and Orion. Initially, direct absorption TDLS was used exclusively in these monitors, however, the H2CO target concentration is much lower, and a longer wavelength required, so a photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) technique was adapted, where the laser excitation is detected by a sensitive microphone vs. a conventional photodetector. This paper will discuss the results of NASA-JSC laboratory testing of a prototype PAS based formaldehyde monitor and explore potential adaptations for Gateway missions and beyond."

Successful performance modeling methods exist for a wide range of traditional aircraft designs. However, comparable modeling methods appropriate for UAM vehicles that combine fixed-wing and rotorcraft performance have not yet been established. One challenge to progress has been the lack of available data capturing the performance characteristics and unique flight profiles of these aircraft. This paper describes methods used to generate the required performance data and the development of performance models for UAM vehicles. Included is a review of the energy and power equations often used in developing performance models for traditional aircraft as well as a discussion of their applicability to UAM vehicles. The challenge of generating realistic performance data in over-actuated vehicles transitioning from hover to cruise flight is also addressed through an approach based on objective function optimization. A table-based performance model format adapted to UAM configurations is described, as well as parametric models intended to accompany the performance table to allow detailed modeling of power and fuel consumption during accelerated flight, turning flight, or flight at an arbitrary climb or descent rate. A discussion of future work is also provided, including the need for refinement of UAM performance modeling methods and formats, especially in conjunction with improvements to aerodynamic modeling of vehicles with complex designs where strong interaction effects may dominate important regions of the flight envelope."

In such a system, the gas turbine will experience a loss of power generation as altitude increases, however the electric system will not. This difference results in designs that may over size the electric system at high altitude or under size at low altitude. Two studies are performed within this paper. The first looks at extracting power from the engine for use with electric aircraft propulsion at cruise and the second reviews a design of an engine that uses thrust assist for takeoff. Both studies look at the effects of changing altitude on the amount of power extraction or insertion that can be taken from the turbofan as dictated by operability limits. Results of the paper show that low-pressure compressor surge margin and high-pressure compressor speed can be pushed to unaccepted limits with large scale power extraction or insertion, however these issues can be mitigated by adding power extraction or insertion at off design operating points to compensate.

focusing on development of a predictive understanding of the export, fate and carbon cycle
impacts of the global net primary production. This co-funded program (NSF, private funding1,
and international participation) was conceived in 2013, with EXPORTS Science plan published in
2016 (Siegel et al 2016, EXPORTS Writing Team 2015) and its implementation plan finalized in
2016 (EXPORTS Science Definition Team 2016). More details are presented in Siegel et al
(2021).

EXPORTS campaign is structured as a multiyear effort (Figure 1). It started with “Pre-EXPORTS”
modeling and data-mining activity followed by a first phase with two major field programs and
a second synthesis and modeling phase. The “Pre-EXPORTS” projects, total of 6 of them (Table
1), funded under A.3 Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry 2015 call, helped to plan the field
campaign (Resplandy et al 2019, Rousseaux & Gregg 2017), and supporting further global
synthesis with datasets mined from the literature (e.g. Bisson et al (2020), Bisson et al (2018),
Kramer and Siegel (2019)), directly responding to objectives outlined in Science Plan (see
section 6 in Team (2015)) and Implementation team (see Figure 1 in Team (2016)).

This document presents a compilation of the final reports of the Pre-EXPORTS funded projects,
in hope of synthesizing the outcomes, and insuring the legacy of this program. Each of these
reports contains a list of published papers, and reader should refer to them to see results in details."

To find a material capable of withstanding the high temperatures and corrosive nature of molten regolith, first-principles thermodynamic calculations were performed on platinum group metals in the presence of iron (Fe) and silicon (Si) to determine favorable compositions for resisting unwanted secondary phases that could form on the surface of the material. As a result of these first-principles calculations, the kinetic properties of elements such as aluminum (Al), Fe, and Si can be more easily derived, which would provide insight into the longevity of such a material when used in an MRE reactor. The effort funded by this CIF project mapped the entire phase diagram of platinum group metals, which is beneficial not only to MRE where high temperatures and molten material are present, but also aerospace applications like turbine materials, terrestrial metal processing techniques, and energy storage applications. This project narrowed a broad spectrum of refractory metals down to a small list of alloys that would be able to survive not only the high temperatures of an MRE reactor, but also the thermodynamic forces that would cause inferior alloys to form secondary phases, which would ultimately consume the electrodes of the reactor. This research needs to be followed up with experimental demonstrations of these alloys in an MRE environment."

Two modeling approaches are explored: the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) with Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model closure, and a hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes/Large Eddy Simulation (RANS/LES) paradigm employing a Zonal Detached Eddy Simulation (ZDES) closure with enhanced shielding protection. Fan stage performance metrics, aerodynamic quantities and turbulent flow structures are analyzed in this work. Initial studies focusing on grid and time-step sensitivity are presented. Sensitivity to different variants of the SA turbulence model is analyzed, supporting the use of the baseline SA model in the production runs. Two conditions are analyzed in detail using URANS and hybrid RANS/LES (HRLES). Mean flow quantities are well-captured by both methods in the low-speed (approach) regime. While URANS misses all the upstream-propagating noise in the inlet due to the rotor-locked tones being evanescent in nature at subsonic fan tip speeds, HRLES captures this broadband component in its pressure field. At the high-speed (sideline) condition, URANS shows better agreement with the SDT data than HRLES in the interstage flow-field. In this regime, URANS captures the tonal content propagating through the inlet, since the tones are now cut-on. Both methods are suitable to capture fan stage performance metrics and mean flow quantities, but only HRLES is able to resolve the fine turbulent structures responsible for broadband noise. The results support the use of the sliding mesh technique implemented in this work for future turbomachinery applications within the LAVA solver framework."

For laser telecommunication to be cost effective for future missions, a wide-spread global network of operationally responsive optical terminals should be established. There has been a decades-old need for a single modular open systems approach (MOSA) ground terminal architecture capable of supporting multiple space missions ranging from LEO to Lunar distances with 2-way laser communications.

At the heart of LCOT’s design concept is the Free-Space Optical Subsytem (FSOS).

The silicon-rubber molds cast on the interface between the nickel nosetip and the stainless steel forebody were measured using a 3D optical measurement system and a stylus profilometer and were evaluated for step direction and height. The step around the nosetip/forebody interface was found to vary in both magnitude and direction, but values were generally modest with most samples below 60 μm across the span and only two samples, both cast in the gutter, with step values larger than 100 μm. Impressions of the secondary-side tripping elements were strictly scanned with the optical device and similar methods were used to calculate trip height as step height. The measured centerline trip height was 2623 ±12 μm, while the leading-edge, quadrant 2 and 3, trip heights were 897 ±5 μm and 891 ±18 μm, respectively. Surface imperfections on the nose and forebody were also evaluated. Surface roughness values and spectra were estimated, and profiles were extracted across the imperfections to quantify the magnitude of those features."

Artemis-1, the uncrewed exoLEO test flight of the Orion spacecraft, was completed in 2022. There were four navigation Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) that are part of the Orion navigation system. The Atmospheric Extended Kalman Filter (ATMEKF) estimates the vehicle position, velocity, and attitude (referred to as the vehicle state) during the ascent and entry phases of flight. Once Orion is outside of Earths atmosphere, the Earth Orbit Extended Kalman Filter (EOEKF) and CisLunar Extended Kalman Filter (CLEKF) estimate the translational states, depending on the phase of flight, while the Attitude Extended Kalman Filter (ATTEKF) estimates the rotational state of the vehicle.  The Kalman filters propagate the vehicle state forward in time using a combination of dynamics models and the output data from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The filters update the vehicle states and associated uncertainties, in the form of the covariance matrix, using pseudorange measurements from GPS (in ATMEKF/EOEKF), optical navigation measurements of the Earth or Moon (in CLEKF), and star tracker measurements (in ATTEKF). Simultaneously, the Kalman filters estimate error sources in the sensors, which are included in the state vectors as Exponentially Correlated Random Variables (ECRVs).

Currently, there is no standard technique or set of metrics to evaluate the level of ACC which compares results obtained by different users and manufacturers. In this work, ACC in different types of capacitors were characterized by analysis of current transients during the constant voltage ramp or power surge testing (PST) techniques. It is shown that although the shape of transients may vary at different test conditions, the transfer charge and energy remain practically the same. The level of ACC is characterized by the energy dissipated in the part during PST. Variations of the dissipated energy with moisture content, test temperature, and voltage are evaluated. Effects of different reflow soldering conditions and long-term (up to 3000 hours) storage at 125 °C are discussed."

By contrast, the recent Fortran standards empower developers to express parallel algorithms without directly referencing lower-level parallel programming models. Fortran’s parallel features place the language within the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) class of programming models. When writing programs that exploit data-parallelism, application developers often find it straightforward to develop custom parallel algorithms. Problems involving complex, heterogeneous, staged calculations, however, pose much greater challenges. Such applications require careful coordination of tasks in a manner that respects dependencies prescribed by a directed acyclic graph. When rolling one’s own solution proves difficult, extending a customizable framework becomes attractive. The paper presents the design, implementation, and use of the Framework for Extensible Asynchronous Task Scheduling (FEATS), which we believe to be the first task-scheduling tool written in modern Fortran. We describe the benefits and compromises associated with choosing Fortran as the implementation language, and we propose ways in which future Fortran standards can best support the use case in this paper."

Often this equipment must not only cover the lower face of the wearer, but also accommodate motion of the lower jaw and resultant deformation of the face shape. Although the application is different, head borne equipmentdesigned for astronauts has similarly critical design requirements including comfort and protection from other environmental hazards while allowing for maximum performance. To improve the design of such systems and to ensure adequate accommodation of the user population, NASA Johnson Space Center is collaborating with the U.S. Army’s Development Command Soldier Center (DEVCOM SC) to statistically analyze facial landmark and measurement data from large Soldier anthropometric databases ( ANSUR 1988 and ANSUR II). Anthropometric measurements were incorporated from 5383 males and 3594 females for analysis, including individuals aged 17-58 across a range of races. Facial landmarks were analyzed, specifically the 3D coordinates of the Menton, Prementon, Gonion, Tragion, Stomion, Zygion, Pronasale, and Subnasale. These data were statistically correlated with demographiccharacteristics, such as sex and population origin. A statistical model of the lower head-face surface geometry is currently in development to describe the variance of head and face shape across the population. The model will be able to visually show the statistical trends of the different shapes and sizes of the head, along with the synthetically represented boundary cases. The specific analytical methods and outcomes will be detailed in the final proceeding. This study will provide a more comprehensive assessment of how face shape varies across the military population compared to traditional linear measurements. The outcome of this study is expected to provide critical insight and recommendations for improved protective equipment design and development, not only with Soldiers but also astronauts in future exploration missions, as well as first responders and others that require critical equipment fitted to the maxillofacial and or mandibular region."

They elucidate and quantify the linkages between viruses and ballast minerals to increase understanding of carbon cycling in the oceanic biological carbon pump and the impact of viruses within it. By providing knowledge than can be used to improve the parameterization of carbon export in Earth system models, the project will help reduce uncertainty in regional marine biogeochemical projections, potentially improving marine ecosystem and fisheries management on timescales from seasons to decades. The project includes activities that provide teaching resources and hands-on training to educators within a ‘Tools of Science’ program that provides a simple and succinct way to communicate the process of scientific research to students in a way that is useful to teachers. 

The project couples laboratory-based experiments on model host-virus-grazer systems with extensive field based observational and manipulative studies on natural populations of diatoms and coccolithophores, the two phytoplankton groups that account for most of the estimated particulate organic matter flux to the deep ocean. Experiments and measurements integrate diagnostic biological and chemical controls on infection and particle coagulation theory with microscale physics and grazing to quantify links to each hypothesized export mechanism under field-relevant turbulent conditions. Cutting-edge engineering and analytical tools are used to diagnose and track infection dynamics while characterizing and quantifying particle aggregation and disaggregation, mineral dissolution, sinking dynamics, grazing rates, and fecal pellet production at unprecedented resolution and under well-defined, microscale physical regimes.

For example, warming can advance the progression of stratification thereby changing the availability of nutrients to surface phytoplankton, or influence the surface mixed layer depth, thus affecting light availability. Here, we use a time series of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll remote sensing products to characterize the response of the phytoplankton community to increased temperature in the Northeast US Shelf Ecosystem. The rate of change in SST was higher in the summer than in winter in all ecoregions resulting in little change in the timing and magnitude of the spring thermal transition compared to a significant change in the autumn transition. Along with little phenological shift in spring thermal conditions, there was also no evidence of a change in spring bloom timing and duration. However, we observed a change in autumn bloom timing in the Georges Bank ecoregion, where bloom initiation has shifted from late September to late October between 1998 and 2020—on average 33 d later. Bloom duration in this ecoregion also shortened from ∼7.5 to 5 weeks. The shortened autumn bloom may be caused by later overturn in stratification known to initiate autumn blooms in the region, whereas the timing of light limitation at the end of the bloom remains unchanged. These changes in bloom timing and duration appear to be related to the change in autumn thermal conditions and the significant shift in autumn thermal transition. These results suggest that the spring bloom phenology in this temperate continental shelf ecosystem may be more resilient to thermal climate change effects than blooms occurring in other times of the year."

This ‘core’ has a considerable task given the rapid cadence of the TES program and the typically low-TRL of payloads; configurability and compatibility are key to prevent mission-specific hardware. However, at only 15 watts the current core has become insufficient to support the program’s growing missions and increasingly demanding payloads. To this end, the NOW program is developing new cores to support two TES mission classes: a single-PCB ‘MiniCore’ designed to support 80-watt missions 6U or smaller in LEO, and a three-PCB, radiation-tolerant ‘StackCore’ designed to support 6U and larger missions over 500 watts in LEO and beyond.

 The ‘MiniCore’ design consists of three main segments: a processor-agnostic C&DH, a software-configured EPS, and a backup low data-rate radio. The design philosophy was to enable rapid-manufacture in a turbulent supply chain, hence the design consists of COTS parts with a focus on those able to be drop-in replaced with radiation-tolerant versions when demanded by the mission. As a single PC-104 sized circuit board, power density and ease of integration also dominated design, demanding the use of modern features such as single-point USB-C for easy charging and monitoring of the spacecraft on the ground. The ‘MiniCore’ can support 80 watts of load, 140 watt-hours of storage, and over 20 watts of optimized solar generation with extensive power monitoring throughout. The ‘MiniCore’ supports one battery pack, six solar-panels, six loads, five actuators, Iridium SBD, and an internal 802.15.4 network. Additionally, the processor-agnostic design can accept any PJRC Teensy 3.x or Adafruit Feather microcontroller unit to enable processor scaling with mission requirements or environment. It is expected a development unit of this design will be completed before conference. 

The ‘StackCore’ design consists of three stacked PC-104 sized circuit boards: one dedicated to power generation and storage, one dedicated to power distribution, and one dedicated to C&DH tasks. This delineation is necessary to support the transition from highly integrated ICs to discrete analog circuitry, enabling a primarily analog control power system able to operate without software in a radiation environment with finer monitoring compared to the ‘MiniCore’ design. The planned base architecture supports over 500 watts of load, 250 watt-hours of storage, and over 80 watts of optimized solar generation. The power distribution board allows for the use of daughter cards hosting custom converters or interfaces for payloads, in addition to the software-configured supplies used on the ‘MiniCore’. This core stack will be managed by a Vorago ARM M4 microcontroller and support the same wireless communications as the ‘MiniCore’, with optional integration of a NOW S-band radio and attitude determination sensors for ‘black box’ functionality. It is expected the prototype will still be in development during conference."

While sex-based differences play an integral role in health on Earth, there is a paucity of data to inform space flight-induced health and performance implications for female astronauts, which may be critical to ensure health, safety, and mission success. Therefore, this retrospective investigation characterized aerobic capacity in female and male astronauts to inform whether sex differences exist from pre to postflight.

METHODS: A NASA historical database (n=47 crew; 11 female, 36 male) of International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers was used to characterize sex differences in aerobic capacity changes from pre to postflight to update the NASA Aerobic and Muscle Risk Evidence Report. Aerobic capacity (VO2pk; ml/kg/min) and peak power (W) were assessed using a graded cycling exercise protocol that included a 3-min warmup at 50 W, with stepwise increases in resistance (25 W/min) until volitional fatigue. Group differences in baseline demographics and the percent change in aerobic capacity from preflight (~90 days before launch) to postflight (~3 days after return) were compared using independent t-tests. Significance was set at P<0.05 (Mean ±SD). 

RESULTS: At preflight, females were younger (44.5±6.6 vs 48.6±5.6 yrs; p=0.041), weighed less (68.8±10.0 vs 81.0±8.8 kg; p< 0.001), with lower VO2pk (32.8±5.9 vs 37.8±6.0 ml/kg/min; p=0.021) and aerobic peak power (229±42 vs 299±52 W; p< 0.001) than males, but had similar heart rate at VO2pk (176.0±7.3 vs 173.0±10.8 beats/min; p=0.406). ISS flight durations (F: 205.0±58.3 vs M: 176.0±40.5 days; p=0.061) and reductions in VO2pk from pre to postflight were comparable between sexes (F: -11.8±10.7%; M: -8.8%±7.9%; p=0.32). However, females had a greater reduction in aerobic peak power than males (−13.3%±8.9% vs −4.9%±8.8%; p < 0.01). 

CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that some indicators of fitness (i.e., aerobic peak power) are more impacted in female astronauts compared to males after long-duration space flight missions. Future investigations with larger sample sizes are necessary to identify the physiological basis of sex-based differences and develop effective countermeasure approaches for both sexes."

This is expected to substantially improve sustainability of the ISS ECLSS and reduce requirement on power and weight. Here, we discuss the current development and evaluation efforts on different alternatives on not only the configuration and setup of the MFECR at an Engineering Design Unit (EDU) scale but also the selection of component materials."

The coupling of FBG sensors to an OFDR interrogator results in a highly distributed measurement system utilizing sensors that are lightweight, immune to electromagnetic interference, and low-profile.  This paper presents and explores a basic derivation of OFDR-FBG signals, the processing of those signals, the assembly of a basic OFDR system, an example measurement scenario, and the effects of specific component and configuration changes on interrogator speed, resolution, and accuracy."

One drawback of these laboratory demonstrations is the insufficient analogy of the analyzed analog samples with expected future targets. We present the results obtained using the K-Ar laser experiment (KArLE) on two old and K-poor chondritic samples, Pułtusk and Hvittis, as better lunar analogs. The KArLE instrument uses laser ablation to vaporize rock samples and quantifies K content by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), Ar by quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS), and ablated mass by laser profilometry. We performed 64 laser ablations on the chondrites to measure spots with a range of K<sub>2</sub>O and Ar content and used the data to construct isochrons to determine the chondrite formation age. The KArLE isochron ages on Pułtusk and Hvittis are 5059 ± 892 Ma and 4721 ± 793 Ma, respectively, which is within the uncertainty of published reference ages, and interpreted as the age of their formation. The uncertainty (2σ) on the KArLE ages obtained in this study is better than 20% (18% for Pułtusk and 17% for Hvittis). The precision, which compares our obtained ages to the reference ages, is also better than 20% (11% for Pułtusk and 4% for Hvittis). These results are encouraging for understanding the limits of this technique to measure ancient planetary samples and for guiding future improvements to the instrument."

However, unmanned aerial vehicles, crewed reentry vehicles, and ground-to-flight extrapolation all benefit from transition models. Because no single transition model is ideal for the complete spectrum of applications, it is useful to incorporate a variety of models in general-purpose CFD solvers, such as the NASA OVERFLOW Overset CFD code. While the Langtry-Menter 𝛄 − 𝑹𝒆<sub>𝛉𝒕</sub> model, currently available in OVERFLOW, has been widely used for CFD predictions of flows with laminar, transitional, and turbulent boundary layers, it does not possess the Galilean invariance property, a desirable attribute for rotorcraft applications. To help overcome that limitation, we have recently implemented Menter's baseline version of the SST-based γ transition model, along with a Galilean invariant stationary crossflow extension within OVERFLOW (version 2.3e). An initial assessment of the newly implemented model has been carried out using 2D benchmark cases including flat plates and the NLF-0416 airfoil, addressing several transition scenarios ranging from bypass transition due to freestream turbulence, natural transition via Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities, and transition due to a laminar separation bubble. The crossflow extension has been applied to the infinite swept NLF(2)-0415 wing and the 6:1 prolate spheroid. Wherever possible, the results were obtained on a sequence of meshes to ascertain the grid convergence behavior, which has been evaluated through global metrics such as force coefficients as well as local values of the skin-friction coefficient at selected points near and within the transition region. Overall, the model appears to be correctly implemented and the results show promise for further development using the framework of the γ transition model."

Driver medical conditions leading to an injured EVA crewmember needing assistance or rescue were analyzed and correlated to established, defined consequence categories. Catastrophic Drivers were identified, and three mitigation strategies were analyzed to determine if there was a potential change in consequence with their application. Risk consequence across the mitigations were compared with each other and the original risk without mitigations. Mitigations were further evaluated in a broader context with prospective preventions to understand the design and risk trade space associated with an early Artemis EVA."

Currently, there are considerable differences in how existing parameterizations represent flux response, timing, and duration of MEE precipitation, especially considering its high-energy tail (≳300 keV). This study compares the nature of ≳300 to ≳30 keV electron fluxes to better understand differences within MEE precipitation. The MEE fluxes are estimated from measurements by the Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED) onboard the Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) from 2004 to 2014. The fluxes are explored in the context of solar wind drivers: corotating high-speed solar wind streams (HSSs) and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) alongside their associated solar wind properties. Three key aspects of ≳300 keV electron fluxes are investigated: maximum response, peak timing, and duration. The results reveal a structure-dependent correlation (0.89) between the peak fluxes of ≳30 and ≳300 keV electrons. The epsilon coupling function correlates well (0.84) with the ≳300 keV peak flux, independent of solar wind structure. The ≳300 keV flux peaks 0–3 days after the ≳30 keV flux peaks. The highest probability (∼42%) occurs for a 1-day delay, while predictive capabilities increase when accounting for solar wind speed. The ≳300 keV flux response has the highest probability of lasting 4 days for both CMEs and HSSs. The results form a base for a stochastic MEE parameterization that goes beyond the average picture, enabling realistic flux variability on both daily and decadal scales."

Monitoring how the ocean carbon cycle is changing is fundamental to managing climate change. Satellite remote sensing is currently our best tool for viewing the ocean surface globally and systematically, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and the past few decades have seen an exponential growth in studies utilising satellite data for ocean carbon research. Satellite-based observations must be combined with in-situ observations and models, to obtain a comprehensive view of ocean carbon pools and fluxes. To help prioritise future research in this area, a workshop was organised that assembled leading experts working on the topic, from around the world, including remote-sensing scientists, field scientists and modellers, with the goal to articulate a collective view of the current status of ocean carbon research, identify gaps in knowledge, and formulate a scientific roadmap for the next decade, with an emphasis on evaluating where satellite remote sensing may contribute. A total of 449 scientists and stakeholders participated (with balanced gender representation), from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Sessions targeted both inorganic and organic pools of carbon in the ocean, in both dissolved and particulate form, as well as major fluxes of carbon between reservoirs (e.g., primary production) and at interfaces (e.g., air-sea and land–ocean). Extreme events, blue carbon and carbon budgeting were also key topics discussed. Emerging priorities identified include: expanding the networks and quality of in-situ observations; improved satellite retrievals; improved uncertainty quantification; improved understanding of vertical distributions; integration with models; improved techniques to bridge spatial and temporal scales of the different data sources; and improved fundamental understanding of the ocean carbon cycle, and of the interactions among pools of carbon and light. We also report on priorities for the specific pools and fluxes studied, and highlight issues and concerns that arose during discussions, such as the need to consider the environmental impact of satellites or space activities; the role satellites can play in monitoring ocean carbon dioxide removal approaches; economic valuation of the satellite based information; to consider how satellites can contribute to monitoring cycles of other important climatically-relevant compounds and elements; to promote diversity and inclusivity in ocean carbon research; to bring together communities working on different aspects of planetary carbon; maximising use of international bodies; to follow an open science approach; to explore new and innovative ways to remotely monitor ocean carbon; and to harness quantum computing. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive scientific roadmap for the next decade on how satellite remote sensing could help monitor the ocean carbon cycle, and its links to the other domains, such as terrestrial and atmosphere."

The current scoping of the SUSAN concept is intended to compete in the medium to large (160-180 seats) narrow body market, with range capabilities of up to 2,500 nautical miles, and expected fuel burn reduction up to 40% relative to conventional 2 engine aircraft. Recent historical trends suggest growth in aviation passenger demand will continue to be met by the narrow body fleet of aircraft; however, a comprehensive review is required to understand how these current fleet trends could evolve in the future. Moreover, estimating and forecasting the potential market size is the critical first step when developing a new aircraft concept to determine commercial viability. To assist in the trade space exploration of the SUSAN concept, a generalized traffic and fleet forecast of the U.S. aviation market is conducted. Using publicly available aviation data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics and passenger demand forecasts from FAA, a multinomial logit model is estimated to predict the composition of the future fleet by aircraft size. These fleet forecasts are then used as inputs for a fleet evolution model to provide required operational forecasts at the aircraft specific level. Forecast scenarios with and without the SUSAN concept are compared, and a breakeven analysis is performed to evaluate the commercial viability of the SUSAN aircraft from an operating cost perspective. Results from the multinomial logit fleet forecast indicate the narrow body size category of 150+ seats dominating the market, comprising 87% of the future revenue passenger miles market share in 2050 (up from 60% in 2019). Forecast scenarios with the SUSAN concept see a maximum cumulative decline in fuel cost of 20% by 2050, while a breakeven analysis shows competitive advantage of the SUSAN aircraft, due to expected fuel burn reduction, at moderate levels of increased maintenance and capital costs."
321,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230004106,2023-08-03,Combined Experimental and Modeling Study of the Interactions of Acid Gas with Common Spacecraft Surfaces for Fire Safety Applications,"<p style=""text-indent: 20px;"">A fire in a spacecraft poses detrimental consequences and risks mission success in addition to crew safety. This is compounded during long-duration missions when the crew has limited options to recover from a fire. A common spacecraft fire concern is the smoldering of wire insulation, typically made from Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). This creates acid gases such as Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN). These poisonous gases are hazardous to the crew. They also interact with common surfaces within the spacecraft more than dominant combustion products such as CO2 and H2O. This makes them more difficult to track for potential fire detection techniques, or for postfire clean-up. It is imperative to be able to understand and predict the fate of these poisonous species in a microgravity environment in order to design a safe vehicle.
<p style=""text-indent: 20px;"">HCl interacts with a number of materials inside a spacecraft. Primary among these materials is aluminum, which is abundantly used due to its strong and light weight nature. Aluminum has a natural oxide layer that protects it from corrosion but is typically treated to enhance this oxide layer. Among these treatments is a chromate conversion coating (CCC), which provides a thin enough protective oxide layer to still conduct electricity, and a traditional anodized material that has a thicker oxide layer that does not conduct electricity. Nomex is another common material found inside a spacecraft. It is a flame-resistant woven polymer that is related to nylon. This commercially available material is used for cargo storage bags and as a fire barrier.
<p style=""text-indent: 20px;"">Physics-based models were developed to predict the uptake of HCl by these materials. The ultimate objective of these models is to predict the fate of HCl within the spacecraft so that sensors can be placed in meaningful locations in future missions based on the model predictions. To support these modeling efforts, experiments were performed in a cast acrylic test cell that measured the difference between the inlet and outlet concentration of HCl after inserting a sample rod of the test material. Different uptake capacities were realized for each type of sample tested. A computational fluid dynamics model (CFD) model of the reactor was then constructed that used a one-step global reaction rate with calibratable reaction (or kinetic) constants. These constants were calibrated to match the HCl uptake on the CCC aluminum samples, and the same kinetic constants were then tested for the stock and anodized aluminum samples. Model predictions matched the experimental data for the stock aluminum, and to a much lesser extent, the anodized aluminum. The model was additionally validated at different flow rates, sample surface areas, and inlet concentrations, and showed good agreement for all stock and CCC samples.
<p style=""text-indent: 20px;"">The model did not accurately predict the HCl uptake in the anodized samples compared to the other two types of aluminum. Adjusting the kinetic constants and transport properties did little to improve the prediction. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine that the oxide layer thickness of anodized aluminum is approximately 5,000 nm, compared to 250 nm for CCC and 50 nm for stock. XPS also revealed presence of chlorine further down in the aluminum oxide layer in anodized samples than CCC and stock samples after the samples were saturated with HCl, indicating that accounting for diffusion of HCl into the oxide layer is important for accurate prediction of HCl uptake onto anodized aluminum. Consequently, a multi-scale model was developed and tested. First, a single pore inside the anodized aluminum oxide layer was modeled and is referred to as the pore-scale model. In this model, HCl diffused through the pore and reacted with the aluminum oxide pore wall to create aluminum chloride. The sample was then saturated when the mass transfer resistance through the growing aluminum chloride layer became too large for the HCl to reach the aluminum oxide wall and continue the reaction. This pore-scale model was coupled to the reactor-scale model using a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, resulting in much more accurate predictions (approximately half the sum square error of the aforementioned reactor-scale model that produced good agreement for stock and CCC) for a variety of operating conditions.
<p style=""text-indent: 20px;"">The amount of water vapor or relative humidity (RH) in the flow during a reactor experiment was determined to influence HCl uptake. Experiments were performed to understand the interaction of gaseous HCl with aluminum surfaces in the presence of water vapor. The results show that increasing levels of RH increased the capacity of aluminum to adsorb HCl but decreased the capacity of Nomex to uptake HCl. A series of tests were performed on individual aluminum samples after they had been saturated with a fixed concentration of HCl in dry air conditions with the goal of determining how their HCl uptake capacity changes after various treatments with water relative to the original saturation tests. HCl-saturated aluminum samples subjected to a second dry air flow at the same HCl concentration as the original test had an uptake of 23.5% of the original sample with no treatment in between. Saturated aluminum samples subjected to an air flow with a RH of 90% in between tests had an uptake of 35.6% of the original. Saturated aluminum samples submerged in distilled water for 12 hours in between tests had an uptake of 82.2% of the original sample. Previously saturated aluminum tested with HCl and a 50% RH air flow resulted in similar uptake characteristics in multiple repeated tests. The experiments show the profound effect water vapor has on HCl uptake onto aluminum surfaces.
<p style=""text-indent: 20px;"">In the samples subjected to water vapor or liquid water, capillary condensation and capillary diffusion alters the transport of HCl significantly. A model was proposed that developed a relationship between RH and the coefficient of HCl diffusion in aluminum chloride. This produced an “S-shaped” curve with diffusion coefficient as a function of RH, with 45% RH represented as the point where the diffusion coefficient is halfway between no water saturation and 100% water saturation in the aluminum chloride product layer. No difference in uptake characteristics for the experiment or model were realized between 50% and 62% RH.
<p style=""text-indent: 20px;"">The results from the large-scale microgravity experiment, Saffire, are discussed as they pertain to the fate of HCl throughout a spacecraft. HCl was released, both as a standalone event, and in concurrence with the burning of a structured cloth. These events only produced a small response in the far field HCl sensor, while a PMMA burn that did not produce HCl had a significantly greater response. A ground-based large-scale facility was constructed to flow acid gas at the scale and configuration realized in the Saffire experiments. A CFD model of this duct was constructed to test kinetic parameters developed in this work at a larger scale and different geometric configuration and to predict the results of the large-scale facility. The models developed in this work were used to interpret the results of the microgravity tests and lead the discussion on what further experiments and models are needed in order to predict the fate of acid gas in a spacecraft environment.
<p style=""text-indent: 20px;"">To summarize, the major contributions of this work are as follows: the capacity to uptake HCl, with and without the presence of water vapor, was measured for a variety of real spacecraft surfaces. Several different models (single reactor-scale, multiscale, spacecraft-scale) were developed and with the aid of modeling, the rate of uptake for those surfaces was also predicted and validated. The kinetic parameters determined from the small-scale reactor experiments and models were used to predict large-scale and microgravity tests. Conclusions from this research will be used in the design of spacecraft vehicles and large-scale microgravity fire safety experiments. The models built by this work will aid designers in sensor placement and could be used to predict acid gas transport from fires in partial gravity, as would be seen in Lunar and Martian habitats."

Two separate approaches (i.e., airfoil modification and blade tip modification) were studied to mitigate the vortex-induced separation. Low-fidelity tools based on blade element momentum theory were shown to mispredict the rotor inflow and were also shown to not capture the vortex-induced separation caused by perpendicular blade-vortex interaction. This misprediction was exploited to isolate the aerodynamic thrust deficit caused by the vortex-induced separation (i.e., 20%) from the thrust deficit due to inflow variation (i.e., 31%). High-fidelity tools were shown to reasonably predict aerodynamic
forces within 13% and flow separation when compared to experimental results. The modified airfoil variant of the baseline rotor effectively mitigated the vortex-induced separation while the blade tip modified variant still showed separation, though the size and strength of the vortex was reduced. Acoustic predictions were underpredicted by 10 dB from preliminary measurements taken in the untreated wind tunnel. Broadband noise contributions from different rotor blade sections showed that self-noise due to flow separation and other turbulent boundary layer mechanisms was the dominant noise source for all three rotor cases, followed by blade-wake interaction noise caused by perpendicular blade-vortex interactions."

Several model architectures were trained and tested on heat capacity data generated from first-principles density functional theory calculations. Hyperparameter optimization was performed, and the optimal model was selected for heat capacity predictions. The optimal model architecture was found to have a root-mean-squared error of 5.12 ± 3.37 J/mol-K. The optimal model architecture was then used in a bagging ensemble model trained using the leave-one-group-out method to provide error estimates for model predictions. The out-of-bag score for the ensemble model was 0.997. The predicted heat capacities agree well with the DFT and experimental results and were computed orders of magnitude faster than DFT simulations. Machine learning shows the potential to provide a suitable surrogate model for thermochemical property predictions for candidate environmental barrier coating materials but refining of input material features and model architectures could further improve accuracy for these models."

The growth of tourism, coastal erosion, and urbanization have all driven land reclamation efforts across many islands. As in-situ landcover change monitoring has proven difficult across the vast archipelago, the NASA DEVELOP team collaborated with the Maldives Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Technology; USAID; and the U.S. Department of State, to utilize Earth observations to predict sea level rise impacts on coastal infrastructure. The team used a supervised classification algorithm within Google Earth Engine to create land use maps and time series analyses of nine islands and atolls using imagery from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument, and PlanetScope, covering a combined period of 2000 through 2023. Additionally, the team projected coastal inundation with a modified deterministic Bathtub model utilizing elevation data from CoastalDEM and 2050-2100 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios identified in the NASA Sea Level Rise Projection Tool. The team found that islands undergoing urban growth experienced a 23% decrease in vegetation between 2014 and 2022. Furthermore, the model predicted that 51–57% of the study area’s-built environment has a chance of inundation by 2100 under the low and high sea level scenarios. These analyses demonstrate how remote sensing can be used to both track land use changes over time and project how coastlines will be affected by sea level rise."

Part II: Aerosol–Meteorology–Cloud Interaction,"Aerosol effects on micro/macrophysical properties of marine stratocumulus clouds over the western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO) are investigated using in situ measurements and large-eddy simulations (LES) for two cold-air outbreak (CAO) cases (28 February and 1 March 2020) during the Aerosol Cloud Meteorology Interactions over the Western Atlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE). The LES is able to reproduce the vertical profiles of liquid water content (LWC), effective radius reff and cloud droplet number concentration Nc from fast cloud droplet probe (FCDP) in situ measurements for both cases. Furthermore, we show that aerosols affect cloud properties (N<sub>c</sub>, r<sub>eff</sub>, and LWC) via the prescribed bulk hygroscopicity of aerosols (¯k) and aerosol size distribution characteristics. N<sub>c</sub>, r<sub>eff</sub>, and liquid water path (LWP) are positively correlated to ¯κ and aerosol number concentration (N<sub>a</sub>) while cloud fractional cover (CFC) is insensitive to ¯κ and aerosol size distributions for the two cases. The realistic changes to aerosol size distribution (number concentration, width, and the geometrical diameter) with the same meteorology state allow us to investigate aerosol effects on cloud properties without meteorological feedback. We also use the LES results to evaluate cloud properties from two reanalysis products, ERA5 and MERRA-2. Compared to LES, the ERA5 is able to capture the time evolution of LWP and total cloud coverage within the study domain during both CAO cases while MERRA-2 underestimates them."

Infrared thermography was used to visualize the heating on the upper surface of both wings of the full-span model, and on the fuselage, for angles of incidence ranging from -10° to 10° at a fixed Reynolds number of 2.4E6 based on the chord length at the wing planform break. The fuselage boundary layer transitioned well upstream of the wing-root leading edge for all conditions. Transition fronts were identified by a steep rise in the surface temperature, and the transition coordinates were transformed from an image-based to a body-fixed system. Additionally, the state of the boundary layer was estimated at pressure ports distributed on the wings through observation of the pressure coefficient as a function of the angle of incidence. For increasing angles of incidence, the transition front was observed to advance upstream, in a mostly spanwise-uniform fashion, from near midchord at α = 0°; however, for increasingly negative angles of incidence, the transition front first receded and then advanced in a nonuniform jagged manner that is typically observed with stationary crossflow. The transition wedges first appeared inboard of the wing break and then spread outboard to near the tip by α = -6°. The upstream shift in transition at positive angles of incidence and the outboard progression of crossflow-dominated transition at increasingly negative angles of incidence are consistent with trends identified in a computational assessment of the boundary-layer transition based on both linear stability analysis and Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes-based transition models. The stability results obtained from the Langley Stability and Transition Analysis Code were used to recalibrate a dual N-factor criterion, which allowed for the prediction of transition fronts that showed excellent agreement with the experiment. The Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes-based models, from the NASA OVERFLOW 2.3 solver, that accounted for the crossflow instability showed mixed results in comparison with the experiment, with the helicity-based Langtry-Menter model performing the best. The experimental data, particularly the cases involving strong influence from both Tollmien-Schlichting and crossflow instabilities, will be valuable for the continued validation and improvement of transition models."

In this study we seek to quantify cross-relationship between sea ice and ocean states in CMIP6 historical simulations and identify common model behaviors. Multi-model mean (MMM) simulations exhibit accelerated changes in the ice and ocean system since the late 20th century. Underlying the MMM is strong inter-model variation in the simulated ice and ocean mean states and their temporal variability including trends. Despite such inter-model differences, all models show a similar ratio between sea ice reduction and upper ocean warming such that models with higher ocean warming also have higher SIE reduction and vice versa. Our results also highlight the urgent needs of reliable Arctic Ocean observations or data products in order to better contextualize modeling results."

Natural limitations in the size of transportation vehicles and ISRU production facilities necessitate an additive strategy with the size of the typical structural unit being essentially fixed and inversely proportional to the final assembly size. In prior robotic and space assembly examples, reversible mechanical integration of structural modules is typically achieved with actuated alignment and fastening mechanisms onboard every structural module. Additive assembly or manufacturing planning approaches often feature a “build front” that receives new materials or parts and progresses gradually across the target geometry. The system we describe here places much of the alignment and fastener actuation systems onboard a mobile robot that can operate at a build front while companion robots (Scaling Omni-directional Lattice Locomoting Explorer, SOLLE) provide part or material transportation. The design and evaluation of this Mobile Meta-Material Interior Co-Integrator (MMIC-I), an inchworm-style locomoting robotic assembler, is described here with an emphasis on ease of assembly and a low number of unique parts for a simple design. It is designed to assist in alignment of cuboctahedron structural unit cells with captive fasteners, defining the build front in operation. Adjacent structural unit cells are locked together with specified axial and rotational actuation of the fasteners. Hardware prototypes show that the robot is able to successfully locomote to any indexed location within a lattice structure and bolt together each set of fasteners on any interface."

The applicability of the method is discussed in the context of Uncrewed Aircraft operations at a regional airport. The relation between traffic interaction uncertainty and operational capacity at the runway is also investigated. The spatio-temporal distribution of traffic operating under Visual Flight Rules is analyzed from historical track data and visualized as heat maps generated at different altitudes. These are used to characterize the spatio-temporal uncertainty associated with traffic density, around a given airport, down to the runway. The traffic patterns at the runway are used to compute the runway capacity as a function of the probability of interaction with traffic operating under visual flight rules.

Local ranchers and landowners have reported strain on their operations, citing decreasing forage for their cattle and a need to adjust their business models. This study identified Major Land Resource Area-48 (MLRA-48) and northwestern Colorado as the key region for analysis. NASA DEVELOP partnered with the BLM Colorado River Field Office, Colorado State University Extension, USDA Forest Service, and the National Drought Mitigation Center to address concerns regarding the efficacy of remotely sensed rangeland production platforms and identify early warning climatic indicators of drought. The study identified two key platforms, The Rangeland Productivity Monitoring Service (RPMS) and Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP), which use NASA Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Landsat 9 OLI-2 to estimate rangeland biomass. We regressed these with in situ biomass data to validate their efficacy and found that RAP was more effective than RPMS in estimating rangeland biomass, though it presents a tendency to overestimate. Our study performed a random forest analysis, comparing monthly RAP biomass estimates to a variety of climate variables, including mean precipitation, temperature, Palmer Drought Severity Index, snow water equivalent, snow persistence from Terra MODIS, wind speed and direction, and vapor pressure deficit. We determined that vapor pressure deficit and precipitation are key indicators in predicting forage production in MLRA-48. Our climate analysis provided our partners with greater understanding of the influence of various climate variables in determining rangeland production and allows them to assist land managers in drought mitigation."

Computer models can be used to predict the filtering effects that the fuselage structure and interior volume have on the exterior sound field in order to simulate the resulting cabin interior noise. However, this can become expensive when a wide frequency range of analysis suitable for passenger auralization is desired. This is particularly the case when using deterministic modeling methods such as finite element analysis (FEA) wherein prohibitively high levels of detail and finite element discretizations are required to resolve the wavelengths at high frequencies. On the contrary, Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA), while not capturing important modal behaviors at low frequencies, is better suited for higher frequency analyses where structural and interior dynamics exhibit high modal overlap and spatially averaged physical quantities suffice. For this reason, a hybrid procedure is considered here that utilizes FE modal solutions at lower frequencies and SEA results at higher frequencies. A transfer function dataset containing the exterior to interior vibroacoustic filtering effect is calculated accordingly and subsequently stored to be used for a variety of exterior dynamic load cases. At low frequencies, the transfer function dataset detail is related to the level of FE model refinement whereas at high frequencies it functions as an equalizer array with a level of detail corresponding to the SEA subsystem partitioning scheme. The above procedure is described herein and demonstrated on a six passenger flight vehicle with eight propulsors in a hover flight condition."

Rather than implementing additional sensors to verify various
deployments, the GOES-R program developed an alternate approach that uses existing gyro rate sensing. The approach includes two pieces: the first is a new onboard shock detection capability to confirm initiation of individual deployment events, and the second is a ground-based dynamics verification step to confirm completion of deployment events. We first present the algorithm that detects shock events for various deployment devices along with the parameter tuning performed during ground tests. We then show inflight performance of the shock detection algorithm. While shock detection is useful for observing initiation of deployment events, completion of some deployment events cannot be determined by shock detection alone. For  these events, such as solar panel latch-up and deployable boom extension, the program developed dynamics models for the deployment transient responses. High-rate gyro data were recorded for these events, which allow the ground team to verify that the appendages were fully deployed. We show the predictive models for these events and corresponding flight results."

Reduced food consumption and loss of body mass and muscle mass have been observed during spaceflight. Hypoxic conditions that astronauts may encounter on exploration missions may further implicate satiety signals and dietary intake. Appetite, food intake, and satiety hormones were investigated under the conditions of mild hypoxia and high energy output during simulated extravehicular activity (EVA) to determine the adequacy of a mission relevant space food system to support energy balance and body composition. 

<b>Methods</b></br>
Foods realistic to early Artemis missions was packed by meal for each subject for the 11-day test based on estimated energy requirements (EER) and estimated EVA caloric requirements. No hot water or food warmer was provided and only room temperature water was available to rehydrate food and beverages in-mission, mimicking plans for early Artemis missions. Measures included food records (pre-mission, in-mission); fasted body weight (pre-mission, in-mission); Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (pre-mission, post-mission); subjective ratings and feedback of food acceptability, mealtime and meal preparation sufficiency, appetite, and nausea (in-mission); and circulating ghrelin and leptin concentration in fasted blood samples (pre-mission, in-mission: pre-post EVA). 

<b>Results</b></br>
All subjects consumed fewer calories in-mission than predicted. On average, subjects consumed 341 calories less on EVA days compared to non-EVA days in-mission (p=0.0511). The total weight loss estimate from daily weight measurements (-1.1 kg, p=0.0028) is consistent with underconsumption and supported by DXA measurements (-1.3 kg total body mass, p=0.0123 and -1.6 kg fat mass, p=0.0016). In general, most foods that were consumed were given acceptable scores, but subject comments indicated that the most acceptable foods were those not intended to be heated. Comments also indicated that subjects found their favorite foods early in the mission and avoided the foods that they did not like throughout the mission. Habitability scores indicated that overall aspects of the food system were considered borderline or unacceptable over the length of this mission. Foods that caused gas were avoided pre-EVA to prevent discomfort during pressure changes. Average fruit and vegetable intake decreased during the mission, dropping from 4.8 servings/d pre-mission to 3.4 servings/d on non-EVA days in-mission (p=0.0872) and 2.3 servings on EVA days (p=0.0020). Fasting ghrelin concentrations tended to be lower pre-EVA and on non-EVA days when exposed to mild hypoxia compared to normoxic conditions pre-mission and post-EVA (p=0.0136). Fasting levels of leptin did not change. 

<b>Discussion</b></br>
Food intake was reduced in-mission, resulting in a caloric deficit and weight loss for most subjects. Crew food and appetite ratings and comments indicated this was due to a combination of food choices, lack of preference, lack of preparation capability, lack of time for meal preparation, consumption, and cleanup, and physiological challenges with the changing pressure. The regulation of appetite stimulating hormone ghrelin, but not the appetite suppressor leptin, appeared to be sensitive to hypoxic conditions.

<b>Conclusions</b></br>
Food preparation capabilities and time for meals are important for promoting adequate food intake. Reduced appetite and food intake during missions may further be aggravated under hypoxic conditions through the suppression of ghrelin. Lack of time for meals on EVA days, and avoidance of potential gas-causing foods (e.g., health promoting fruits and vegetables) prior to EVAs, demonstrate the importance of scheduling ample recovery time between EVA days."

This site has been designated Solid Waste Management Unit (SWMU) 117 under KSC’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action Program, as the sewage treatment plant and associated areas were identified as a potential source of PFAS to the environment. This PFAS SAPR was prepared by Tetra Tech, Inc., for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract 80KSC019D0011-80KSC019F0070. This is the first progress report to document on-going SA activities; supplemental progress reports will be provided as additional data is collected.

PFAS SA activities were conducted between April 2020 and March 2022 to collect additional data to supplement the existing datasets to better understand the extent of PFAS impacts to the environment in the STP1 Area. The SA for the STP1 Area covers an approximately 130-acre investigation area with multiple structures and buildings. The focus of the SA is the STP1
Complex and associated structures, including the former Polishing Pond, former Sludge Disposal8 Area, and former Spray Field. The STP1 Complex is located in the KSC Industrial Area, at the southwest corner of 4th Street SE and C Avenue SE. The STP1 Complex is located approximately ¼-mile south and downgradient of the Fire Station #1 site (SWMU 116), which is also currently undergoing a PFAS SA because of potential releases of PFAS-containing aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF).

During the SA, a total of seven soil, 131 groundwater direct push technology (DPT), 24 groundwater monitoring well, and 11 surface water samples were collected between April 2020 and March 2022. Monitoring well samples were analyzed for 18 PFAS compounds, with all other samples analyzed for 28 PFAS compounds. The SA sample results were used along with historical results to evaluate the extent of PFAS impacts to the environment in the STP1 Area. Data generated to date and prior results were screened against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) May 2022 Tap Water Regional Screening Levels (RSL) for groundwater and residential RSLs for soil (hazard quotient of 0.1). Surface water results were screened against the State of Florida Human Health Surface Water Screening Levels (SWSLs).

Results from the SA showed exceedances of the applicable screening criteria for groundwater and surface water. Considering the current and historical dataset, PFOS is the prevalent PFAS compound. Based on these results, additional groundwater DPT and surface water sampling should be considered for PFAS analysis, focused on evaluating surface water bodies in the southeast portion of the Industrial Area, which discharge into the Banana River. Additionally, installation of monitoring wells should be considered to evaluate the interaction between the groundwater and surface water at the site. Collection of additional samples for TOC analysis should also be considered from representative groundwater (saturated soils) and surface water locations to further evaluate potential correlations between PFAS and TOC to provide a more comprehensive dataset to assist in fate and transport analyses."

Spacecraft operability must be “fail-safe” to ensure these basic human life support conditions are maintained throughout the mission and the mission(s) must be affordable. There are known effects and unknowns effects regarding aspects of human health for Mars duration missions. Mars has the order of a third g. We have no data regarding the health impacts of this on humans or the combinatorial effects associated with 45% GCR on the Martian surface over time. There is a suspicion that if humans survive such conditions over long times they will evolve to living at reduced g and become “Martians”. Cascading failures and subcritical degradations in systems of systems causing an overall unrecoverable failure are a potential issue. There are two exremely complex systems associated with humans-Mars missions: the technical, engineering, and architectural system of systems that enable the mission and the humans. Both need to be mutually configured and operated to mitigate the overall risks and hazards of the mission. Regarding the humans that mitigation includes both the mission risks and supporting-to-increasing the human immune and other concomitant physiological systems. This report will summarize the risks, current mitigation approaches, and putative approaches including lifestyle, nutrition, and “wellness” approaches to possibly improve the human capacity to withstand the large number of combinatorial human physiological rigors of the missions.

However, high suspended sediment levels during flushing events have negatively impacted downstream aquatic ecology and recreational opportunities. To address these problems, DEVELOP partnered with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Shoshone River Partners, and United States Geologic Survey. During term one, the team developed a workflow to map turbidity using PlanetScope imagery, analyze time series precipitation data, and create landcover maps. For this term, we focused on three methods to gain a better understanding of sediment sources: 1) improving remote sensing of turbidity, 2) modeling sediment transport within the watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and 3) conducting a snow cover time series analysis using Suomi NPP VIIRS imagery. Through remote sensing, we found Dry Creek/Homesteader Creek and Penney Gulch/Rough Gulch had the highest concentration sediment plumes. The SWAT+ model created a high-resolution grid model of the watershed, identifying high sedimentation in the western and southern subbasins but displayed low-correlated calibration and validation results due to limited observed data. We analyzed the snow cover extent alongside other hydrologic variables and found that snow melt events correlated with increases in suspended sediment concentration and turbidity values. Coupling remote sensing with hydrological modeling will give watershed managers a new perspective on high-priority regions for implementation of remediation to reduce the sediment build-up at the Willwood Dam."

In this paper, a design optimization study is carried out to compare mechanically geared, magnetically geared, and direct drive motor drivetrain topology achievable performance in a 100 kW hover power quad rotor propulsor application. Design studies are carried out accounting for a nominal mission profile. Studies are carried out assuming constant propulsor rotor RPMs of 400, 1000, 2000, and 3000 RPM. Results show that mechanically geared drives are the lightest at all RPMs but their weight benefit over direct drive and magnetically geared decays with increased rotor RPM. Direct drive is shown to always achieve the highest efficiency due to its lower motor speed resulting in low electrical frequencies. Magnetically geared drivetrains are shown to need some requirement refinement or technology improvement to provide significant benefit over direct drive drivetrains."

This paper reports a new approach to modeling the interface between fluid and material, with attention to the conservation of species mass flux and energy on the fluid side of the interface. The general equation is presented and is shown to recover the traditional uncoupled fluid/materials response interface. Including the chemical reaction terms on the CFD side of the interface makes the heat flux exchange independent of the thermodynamic reference state and, therefore, a measurable quantity. Doing so allows the material response solver to take as input the surface heat flux rather than a film coefficient. Removing the film coefficient approximation enables more direct solution of vehicle thermal response but requires consistency in the wall state.     The mixing of the shock layer and pyrolysis gas is then computed with finite rate chemistry within the fluid solver. The boundary conditions described have been implemented in the DPLR v4.05.1 code. Char removal is captured using finite rate chemistry in DPLR’s gas surface interaction module. Aspects of coupling these solutions to material response are discussed."

Synoptic (i.e., concurrent and spatially unified and resolved) observations of thermospheric temperature and composition at ∼150 km altitude are made for the first time, allowing GOLD to disambiguate temporal and spatial variations. Here we analyze the daytime effective temperature and column integrated O and N2 density ratio (ΣO/N<sub>2</sub>) data simultaneously observed by GOLD over 120°W–20°E longitude and 60°S–60°N latitude from 13 October 2019 to 12 October 2020. Daily zonal mean values are calculated for each latitude and compared with NRLMSIS 2.0 and simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X). On average, the GOLD observations show higher temperatures than Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter radar (MSIS) and WACCM-X by ∼20–60 K (5%–10%) and 80–120 K (12%–18%), respectively. The ΣO/N<sub>2</sub> ratios observed by GOLD are larger than the MSIS results by ∼0.4 (40%) but smaller than the WACCM-X simulations by ∼0.3 (30%). The observed and modeled results are correlated at most latitudes (r = 0.4–0.8), and GOLD, MSIS, and WACCM-X all display a similar seasonal variation and change with latitude. WACCM-X simulates a larger annual variation in ΣO/N<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that the thermospheric circulation is overestimated and atmospheric waves and turbulence transport are not properly represented in the model."

This report details experiments in the NASA Langley Grazing Flow Impedance Tube to quantify the relative drag of several perforate-over-honeycomb liner configurations at flow speeds of M=0.3 and 0.5. Various perforate geometries and orientations are investigated to determine their resistance factors using a static pressure drop approach. Comparison of these resistance factors gives a relative measurement of liner drag. For these same flow conditions, acoustic measurements are performed simultaneously with the drag measurements for tonal excitation from 400 to 3000 Hz at source sound pressure levels of 140 and 150 dB. Educed impedance and attenuation spectra are used to determine the impact of variations in perforate geometry on acoustic performance. The goal is to identify a perforate that will reduce the drag penalty associated with conventional round-hole perforates by 60%. One perforate design, based on a slot geometry, is shown to reduce this penalty by 50%. Further reductions may be possible but require a reduction in measurement uncertainty to allow a statistically rigorous evaluation."

Lunar missions, both crewed and uncrewed, include orbiters, landers, rovers, and surface stations.  

All these missions require communications with Earth, either via Direct to Earth (DTE) links or through relays in lunar orbit. Multiple DTE options are available among existing and planned ground stations: Deep Space Network (DSN), European Space Agency, and others.  Relay options include the planned Lunar Gateway, LunaNet compliant relays, and some lunar landers propose to launch dedicated orbiters.

The dilemma for lunar system designers is to identify a communication link which meets mission requirements but does not have issues of limited access (e.g. DSN is in high demand supporting deep space missions with high priority and some with inflexible schedules), system impacts (high power Radio Frequency (RF) for DTE links), cost (dedicated relay), or operational date. 

To avoid this difficult decision, a Flexible Radio for Lunar Missions is proposed, which will enable system designs to proceed prior to any final decision on the communication network to be used, by enabling compatibility with any of multiple DTE or orbital relay communication systems.  The Flexible Radio will support the necessary frequency, bandwidth, modulation, and power requirements to interoperate with the majority of known or planned DTE or relay systems, and can be designed into a lunar mission without prior knowledge of which link will ultimately be used.  Furthermore, the link being used can be changed as needed during the mission, in near real time.

The Flexible Radio design will leverage work already completed at NASA in the areas of Wideband RF, Software Defined Radio, Adaptive Coding and Modulation, and Phased Array antennas.

The Flexible Radio requires sufficient bandwidth to cover the allocated frequencies for both the operation of links in cislunar space and for space-to-Earth links; the flexibility to support multiple modulations, data rates, and coding schemes; the ability to identify available relays, detect and recognize the signals of those relays, and adapt its own frequency, modulation, symbol rate, and code rate to operate with the detected relay (or DTE station); and finally, it requires appropriate software to support network configuration and interoperability with the detected network.

The Flexible Radio can be designed in a sufficiently small, lightweight, and low-power package to be used in a wide variety of lunar systems.

The initial implementation, as proposed, will focus on the Ka-band, supporting up to 2 GHz bandwidth around the 27 GHz frequency for return links, and 23 GHz for forward links.  Other frequency bands are under consideration for future configurations.

The software defined modem will support OQPSK, BPSK, and NASA-defined modulations which also support two-way ranging with data.

For near-real time adaptation, the Flexible Radio will scan the sky for available relays, using a phased array antenna with Adaptive/Cognitive Communications.  It will then configure for network interoperability supporting DTN and other protocol options.  The Flexible Radio will support scheduled connections and on-demand use when available."

This reduced-order model is combined with a simple finite element beam model of a sting to estimate the dynamics of the full assembly. We make comparisons between a full finite element model and the hybrid reduced-order model to show that this hybrid reduced-order model is capable of predicting the first six natural frequencies to within 10% error. This technique could be used to identify reduced-order parameters for a large number of balances and stings, which could then be used to estimate the dynamics of different measurement assemblies."

Capturing Micro-Behaviors in Teams,"Future long-duration space exploration (LDSE) crews will require extensive coordination, cooperation, and team functioning as they face a myriad of challenges rooted in both taskwork and teamwork (Bell et al., 2015; Landon et al., 2018). While exposed to extreme conditions, crew members must navigate living and working together in prolonged confinement. Moreover, astronaut teams are becoming increasingly diverse, introducing significant variability in team composition. This increasing diversity, alongside traditional constraints of LDSE, introduces additional challenges into effective team functioning.

To date, most methods for capturing team functioning rely on self-report measures. Such measures are prone to several limitations, including but not limited to social desirability bias, halo effect, and leniency effects (Trull & Ebner-Priemer, 2013), which skew data and limit nuanced understandings of phenomena at play. Self-report measures broadly capture team functioning, lending the nature of such methods to identifying underlying “macro”-behaviors (i.e., behaviors that are long-standing and last over time). However, team functioning is far more complex than a series of macro-behaviors, rendering reliance on self-report data deficient for accurate measurement.

Recent research demonstrates the potential of alternative methods for capturing team functioning, such as speech and physiological data (Chaffin et al., 2017; Murray & Oertel, 2018). Consequently, these methods are more suitable for capturing micro-behaviors: brief, often unconscious expressions that affect the extent to which an individual feels included by others around them (Paletz et al., 2013). Micro-behaviors can be further classified into microaggressions (i.e., subtle, negative exchanges; Keller & Galgay, 2010) or micro-affirmations (i.e., subtle, positive exchanges; Kyte et al. 2020), both of which influence team functioning.

Due to the subtle nature of micro-behaviors, contextual factors have a significant impact when determining if it is aggressive or affirmative. Additionally, several iterations of microbehaviors can have lingering effects on team interactions. For example, the use of “mm-hmm” by a crew member can function as both a micro-affirmation and micro-aggression. Specifically, it can be indication of active listening (i.e., micro-affirmation) or as an expression of annoyance (i.e., aggression) depending on the context in which it occurs. Auditory features (e.g., tone, frequency) can help delineate between the two forms; however, the contextual factors (e.g., previous interactions between team members, crew demographics) add a layer of complexity that render auditory features alone as insufficient to capture micro-behaviors.

Consequently, this paper seeks to provide a novel approach in which multi-modal data (i.e., auditory features and contextual features) are used in a random-forest model to better identify distinguishing characteristics between micro-affirmations and micro-aggressions. In turn, detected micro-behaviors are used to predict team performance, thereby demonstrating the value of capturing micro-behaviors as supplemental data to macro-behaviors."

An approach to estimate the permeability of water through the various coating systems using the oxide thickness versus time measurements and the theory of oxide growth is demonstrated.

DDFRG1 was a previous model developed for production of protons and light ions. A new model for pion production is developed in the present work and is called DDFRG2, which is based upon thermal production of pions from a central fireball source. The Lorentzinvariant double-differential cross section is calculated in the central fireball frame, and is Lorentz transformed to the laboratory frame, which results in a closed-form analytic formula involving no numerical integration, and which can be run very efficiently in radiation transport codes. The Lorentz-invariant double-differential cross section is then integrated over angle to give the singledifferential energy spectral distribution. Two versions of the DDFRG2 pion production are developed, namely DDFRG2-SIMPLE and DDFRG2-FULL. Both versions produce pion production Lorentz-invariant double-differential cross sections and also pion production single-differential spectral (energy) distributions. The SIMPLE version contains only one adjustable parameter. The FULL version contains three additional adjustable parameters. Both DDFRG2 versions are compared to over 1,000 data points. The SIMPLE version describes the p + <sup>12</sup>C → π − much better than the current HZETRN pion model. For other reactions, the SIMPLE version is of comparable quality to the current HZETRN pion model compared to data. For both the p + <sup>12</sup>C → π − reaction and all other reactions, DDFRG2-FULL describes the data much more accurately than the current HZETRN pion model."

Present-day International Space Station (ISS) EVA operations require an intricate and tight choreography of crew, space suits, tools, systems, and flight teams to plan, train, and execute with limited advanced informatics. Additionally, EVA operations, aside from the Apollo Lunar surface missions, have predominately focused on maintenance and construction tasks where success criteria are clearly measurable. However, future exploration missions expect to enable crew to carry out scientific objectives in increasingly Earth-independent ways. In this paper, the Joint Augmented Reality Visual Informatics System (Joint AR) characterizes the design space for developing a modular augmented reality (AR) device for a spacesuit form factor that can support crew decision-making for EVA. This paper highlights the project’s experience with a product-focused management style and use-case centered systems engineering approach to iteratively design, build, and test. The Joint AR product features were defined via trade studies and market analysis of previous EVA display efforts, various AR components such as optics, commercial AR systems, light engines, data interfaces, graphics engine software and analog test beds. We outline the defining architectural design decisions, including safety criticality considerations, suit mounting interfaces, computer architectures, and partnership contracting mechanisms. The outcomes of these studies, architecture decisions, and management requirements result in a recommended design which is the Joint AR product. We discuss the evolution, development of these system components, and what work remains. We hope to share a unified understanding of various design decisions and how they impact the future of crew members’ access to data during Lunar and Martian EVAs. This ongoing effort can enable a community-wide discovery process toward realizing necessary AR features and capabilities for future missions."

373,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017551,2023-08-03,Analysis of Strategic Conflict Management Approaches as Applied to Simulated UAM Operations,"This report presents the results of a comparison analysis of candidate Strategic Conflict Management (SCM) strategies as applied to Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations. The SCM strategies investigated included: no SCM, resource scheduling (RS), resource flow rates (FR), area-based flow rates (AR), and conflict detection and resolution (CR). The study evaluated each strategy against the same 3 levels of flight demand in a representative airspace construct for the Dallas/Fort Worth region. The study also accounted for different levels of uncertainty in operational planning and equivalent levels of trajectory following error. In the analysis, we compared the SCM strategies’ effectiveness in reducing the need for the tactical conflict management layer to act and looked at the metrics of unmitigated losses-of-separation (LOS), flight delays imposed by strategic planning, and throughput of the overall airspace. 

The study results indicated that the CR strategy was the most effective at reducing LOS and percentage of flights with LOS, even in the presence of trajectory error when uncertainty is accounted for in planning. Thus, if the objective is to reduce the number of actions that the tactical conflict management layer will have to take, in terms of conflicts that may need to be resolved, CR is the strategy to use. The FR strategy was found to be the worst at reducing LOS and percentage of flights with LOS. Thus, it is not very effective at reducing the actions required by a tactical conflict management layer.

In the airspace tested, the demand was high enough to produce unacceptable levels of flight delay and reductions of throughput when the SCM strategies were implemented. This was especially evident at the higher levels of trajectory uncertainty and error. The need to account for expected levels of uncertainty becomes more and more important as the demand level increases and as the level of trajectory error increases. This is because the likelihood of flights with LOS increases as the density of operations increases and as the level of trajectory error increases. 

Accounting for uncertainty in the SCM strategies improves the strategy effectiveness with respect to LOS but increases delays and reduces throughput. Thus, there is a tradeoff between scalability and allowable levels of uncertainty. That is, we can implement an air traffic management construct that allows high levels of uncertainty, but we can expect that same system to have limits on scalability that may be evident even at small demand levels, such as those used in this study. Therefore, the results in this study indicate that an air traffic system should attempt to implement mechanisms appropriate for reducing uncertainty where possible in order to increase the chances for scalability. And this increased level of predictability of operations needs to be balanced with mechanisms for ensuring flexibility when operational conditions and plans need to change, even though those types of changes should be the exception rather than the rule under normal conditions.

The study also introduced a trade space that could serve as a mechanism for selecting the appropriate SCM strategy in a trade-off between uncertainty and error, mean flight delay, and the LOS metrics (which this study equates to the potential for tactical conflict management actions). The optimal solution for a given airspace, demand level, and other factors, could likely be a combination of SCM strategies, although this study only compared the use of a single SCM strategy at a time. The CR strategy appeared to have the best opportunity for scalability by limiting the number of potential tactical actions to nearly zero."

375,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017651,2023-08-03,Monitoring Airspace Complexity and Determining Contributing Factors,"The national airspace has evolved over many years to accommodate increased traffic demand while simultaneously maintaining air travel as one of the safest forms of transportation. One of the reasons for this success is the ability of the air traffic control system and the operators to adapt and accommodate to situations that routinely disrupt normal operations. These situations may include: adverse weather, delays, early arrivals, equipment outages, and other factors that are outside the operators’ ability to control. These factors can lead to states where automation is unable to properly handle these issues, and therefore air traffic controllers and pilots have to intervene — ultimately increasing communication between operators resulting in higher workload. As controller workload increases to handle sub-optimal operating conditions, complexity increases. This is because, under these conditions humans are required to make tactical decisions in response to external factors. This results in a departure from the original strategic plan where operations would be more efficiently managed. Human operators manage airspace complexity under rigid regulations but in a constantly changing environment. The airspace is divided into sectors and the number of aircraft assigned to each controller is limited for safe handling. Some prior studies devised airspace complexity metrics in commercial aviation and related these metrics to controller workload. The upper bounds on the system load are pre-determined. Such bounds on complexity make for a safe system, but the system cannot scale and adapt to autonomous, dense, and heterogeneous traffic — including the many types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) envisioned to be added to the operations. We hypothesize that, as traffic density and heterogeneity grow, and other key metrics change, there will be phase transitions at which the way traffic should be managed changes significantly. We offer a method for in-time detection of contributing factors that lead to phase transitions, characterized by increased complexity. To the best of our knowledge, there is no tool similar to ours that identifies such contributing factors or precursor patterns."

This test leveraged several unique diagnostic capabilities, including eight distributed force and moment measurements on the launch tower tiers, new umbilical and crew access arm configurations, and unsteady pressure acquisition on the rocket nose in the cargo configuration. The tower loading revealed a strong impact of the SLS vehicle height on force coefficients for individual tiers. Although the umbilicals produced weak influence on the loading on both vehicle and launch tower, unsteady pressure measurements revealed a slight increase in fundamental pressure oscillation frequency at specific wind azimuth directions. Multimodal flow states were observed in the gap flow between the vehicle and solid rocket boosters, producing different load profiles along the vehicle that are now incorporated in the vehicle database. This phenomenon was investigated using time-series measurements of forces as well as tufts and smoke flow visualization."

Several different designs for helium compressor technologies have been developed for use on Earth; however, significant design changes are required to meet the power, thermal/heat dissipation, vacuum, vibration/shock, size, mass, and efficiency requirements needed for space and launch environments. Currently, no capability exists for mass efficient on-orbit GHe (or xenon) transfer, nor has it ever been attempted. This effort proposed several challenging requirements for the vendor to develop a one-of-a-kind pneumatic compressor prototype.

In order to develop a compressor prototype at a TRL 4, a partnership with Air Squared, Inc. was established. This CIF project concluded with the receipt of a prototype along with a proposed design for a flight unit; however, it will not be built due to funding limitations. 

The vendor had moderate success with initial testing of the prototype at lower pressures (with shimming configured for low pressure). There were delays with testing since the unit was built for higher pressures and the low pressure shimming was challenging to implement. It was found that operation of the compressor at lower pressures caused increased friction on the motor shaft which resulted in the unit drawing more power (current). This was initially thought to be a motor or controller defect. Subsequent high pressure testing at KSC showed that the friction was reduced for the optimal design point (with a high pressure shimming configuration) and the motor (and controller) performed nominally. Following the vendor testing, the unit was tuned/shimmed for a nominal inlet pressure and shipped to KSC for high pressure testing using the custom-designed setup in the Vehicle Assembly Building. The unit performed well, showing the capability to achieve over higher pressure of compression. The pressure differential could likely increase, however, the maximum output of the power supply used for testing was reached, limiting the compressor motor’s capability. Following the GN2 testing, the test setup was converted to GHe with at high pressure. It was shown that although the unit was unable to achieve similar high pressure differentials due to reverse leakage of the GHe through the scroll tip seals, it did achieve the desired GHe compression. This may still be useful for some applications, however, for the purpose of on-orbit GHe transfer, the single stage design would need to be changed to include multiple stages to achieve the compression goals initially proposed by the project."

The freestream Mach number is 0.75,and the Reynolds number based on the chord length is 10million. These conditions are the same as the wind-tunnel experimental conditions of McDevitt and Okuno (1985).1The NASA FUN3D solver is used for the simulations, which is an unstructured, compressible flow solver.

Aerodynamic results at the Reynolds number of 1.8 million show good comparison with the experimental measurements at different angles of attack from pre-stall to post-stall regimes. The pressure plateaus caused by the flow separation and the recovery of pressure inside the separation bubble around the iced leading edge are well predicted with the scale-resolving simulations when sufficient grid resolution is used around the accreted ice. The unsteadiness of the turbulent flows around the iced airfoil is also examined through the turbulent kinetic energy with the Reynolds normal stress anisotropy. Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (KHI) arises at the shear layer triggered by the upper ice horn and leads to rapid laminar-to-turbulent transition over a large range of angle of attack. With the increase of the angle of attack, the region with high turbulence intensity induced by the unstable shear layer spreads quickly over the entire upper surface of the airfoil. The coherent KHI modes from the upper and lower ice horns are extracted using the spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) technique. The SPOD modes  extracted from the upper shear layer have large-scale variations in the spanwise direction and low-rank behavior where the energy of the leading SPOD mode at each Strouhal number of the KHI largely represents the total energy when the mode number in the spanwise direction is small."

The goal of P-ACTIVE is to develop all-solid-state tunable optical filters that can serve as low-Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) replacements to the ubiquitous filter wheel technology current in use, and serve as a starting point for completely new optical component technologies. By using materials commonly used in electronic memory devices, namely chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs), in conjunction with nanostructured surfaces with exotic, tailored optical responses (“metasurfaces”), the P-ACTIVE filters are able to tune their optical transmission/reflection behavior in real-time. Because of this new functionality, P-ACTIVE filters are highlighted for NASA science and space programs such as next generation Lidar, landing system (SLS) thermal monitoring, thermal imaging, imaging spectroscopy, and disaster monitoring (e.g., volcanic  eruption observations from SmallSats). 

This document intends to serve as a compendium of the P-ACTIVE project. We begin by describing the project from background science and assume no prior knowledge of the subject. We then address experimental and theoretical results of P-ACTIVE device performance, as well as recent results obtained from the MISSE-14 mission related to space qualification of P-ACTIVE devices and constituent materials. We conclude with a prospective view of the P-ACTIVE technology, and discuss the potential for these filters and other similar metasurface devices to serve NASA’s mission."

Heavy rainfall events oversaturate the ground, overflow waterbodies, and overwhelm stormwater infrastructure. Vulnerable areas receive heavy damage from flooding events due to physical factors like increased impervious surfaces, poor stormwater systems, and limited greenspaces. These vulnerable neighborhoods are comprised of aging populations, minority communities, and lower income levels. Lack of data in these communities have made it difficult to implement policymaking and flood mitigation strategies. Using the Urban Flood Risk Mitigation model (InVEST) and the PlanetScope satellite constellation, the team visualized historical flooding and tree canopy coverage as a measure of flood susceptibility. The team also used the Arc-Malstrom model to provide further insight into where flooding accumulates via surface elevation depressions in the study area. To validate these models, the team explored the spatial variation of rainfall events using NASA’s Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM IMERG). The resulting maps highlight areas surrounding the cities of Youngstown and Warren as being the most flood susceptible and socially vulnerable, while the city centers contain the lowest tree canopy coverage. The DEVELOP team collaborated with the Environmental Collaborative of Ohio (ECO) to create products for end users within the City of Warren’s Water Pollution Control Department, the Eastgate Regional Council of Governments and the Healthy Community Partnership of Mahoning Valley. These products help identify target areas for preventative flood mitigation measures as well as areas ideal for green infrastructure intervention."

Aviation can be a solution. Organizations supporting NASA’s Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept are conducting studies on feasible concepts of operations for the new air traffic management system required to implement UAM. NASA’s High Density Vertiplex (HDV) team conducts studies using both live flights and simulations.

Significance:  The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a communication tool developed for this team to enhance team situation awareness. Specifically, the study aims to determine if the communication tool is effective in allowing NASA-Langley and NASA-Ames team members playing different roles to understand what others are doing so that completed steps can be communicated to the whole team. 

Methods:  This study asks participants to conduct four distinct scenarios using an Adobe XD prototype. Participants included five members of the target audience, who each received up to 15 minutes of training on how to use the Adobe XD prototype. The participants were NASA-Ames or NASA-Langley researchers, developers or tech leads who had 0 to 15 years of experience. Their ages ranged from 20 to 40 years old, and they were of both genders. After training, each participant was asked to do 4 tasks of varying difficulty, using the prototype testbed. After each task they reported on task difficulty and after all tasks were completed they were asked to fill out the System Usability Survey (SUS). Performance will be assessed through task completion time and accuracy rating. 

Results: User perception was evaluated by the SUS which showed a mean score over the six participants of 84. All the participants were above the acceptable range which was 70 and nobody was in the marginal usability zone between 50 and 70. In addition, most of the participants did well in terms of time on task, success rate and task difficulty on all the tasks except for Task 3. Participants had two minutes to do the task correctly to succeed at the task, otherwise it was marked as a failure. The geomean for Task 1 for completion time was 22.20; Task 2 was 58.28; Task 3 was 84.68 and Task 4 was 19.61. In Task 3, three out of six people failed this task but all five scored this with an average score 4.2 out of 5 for self-rating on task difficulty."

The Composite Materials Handbook-17 (CMH-17) suggests developing strength allowables at the coupon level (lowest level of the “building block” approach) and using a rigorous statistical analysis to arrive at a strength allowable upon which the structure is to be further designed at higher levels of the building block pyramid. But do these coupon level tests truly represent meaningful stresses at which the composite in the final structure can withstand considering the effects of loading rate? Open hole compression (OHC) strength was chosen for this study since most structures are designed to some damage tolerance criteria and OHC strength testing is rather simple to perform. A quasi-isotropic lay-up was chosen since this is a very common lay-up sequence. The results show that for structures that experience a very small loading rate (0.0005 in/min) the allowables developed at the standard 0.05 in/min loading rate are higher than what the composite can withstand at this lower loading rate. Conversely, at a high loading rate of 10 in/min the strength values found at the standard test rate of 0.05 in/min are slightly lower and not “in family” using the statistics suggested in CMH-17. These results question if standardized test rates are reliable, at least to the fidelity of being “in family” per CMH-17. Some creep rupture tests were also performed to demonstrate that OHC strength values could be lower than the slowest test speed used in this study (0.0005 in/min)."

Currently, the concept for satellite pointing relies on a dual axis star tracker that compares images of the celestial sphere to a star catalog to obtain a 3-axis orientation solution. Most star trackers are designed with a wide field of view (required to obtain enough bright starts to achieve a navigational fix) and only provide reliable pitch and yaw estimates thus necessitating the use of a second star tracker looking at an axis perpendicular to the first one to obtain an accurate estimate of the roll of the spacecraft.

In the new concept the optical design will be modified to ensure that both the Earth and the Moon will be within a narrow field of view centered on Earth relative to the field of view of most star tracking systems. Because of the proximity of the bodies, it is possible to obtain highly accurate estimates of the pitch, yaw and roll of the spacecraft relative to the Earth/Moon system. The new tracker will allow for accurate 3-axis control of the spacecraft from a single tracker thus allowing the second star tracker, which would normally be pointed in a direction perpendicular to the one pointed at earth, to obtain the spacecraft roll estimate. This wide field star tracker facilitates functions like the initial satellite pointing during the acquisition phase of establishing the laser communication link or solving the lost in space problem should the system need to be reset. This new design will be tested in simulation and compared for 3-axis pointing accuracy against a standard commercial star tracker."

One of the most popular ML class of models is artificial neural networks (ANN). ML is increasingly being used in the design and analysis of composite materials and structures, specifically in the constitutive modeling of composite materials with the focus on greatly accelerating multiscale analyses of composite materials and structures through development of surrogate models. Towards that end, both Python and MATLAB-based neural nets have been developed to predict initial stiffness and fatigue life of an eight-ply symmetric polymer matrix composite laminate. Two types of neural networks, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), have been developed for both platforms. Results show that the both neural net types can provide an excellent estimate of initial stiffness as well as fatigue life of eight-ply symmetric polymer matrix composite laminate. RNNs are better able to capture the shape of the fatigue curve of a laminate. This tool can be very useful for system level studies to obtain an estimate of desired properties and life of PMC composite laminates. The associated surrogate models could also be used in composite multiscale analyses to replace the actual physics-based calculations at lower scales and thereby significantly increase the computational efficiency of such analyses and thus make multiscale analyses a viable industrial tool for large scale structural problems."

Mechanically connected joints used in cryogenic fluid lines as part of space flight elements need to survive launch vibrations and remain leak-free to minimize the loss of on-board commodity and hazardous gas accumulation.  In 2020, a cryogenic test apparatus was developed which can evaluate the leak performance of pressurized threaded fluid fittings.  The fittings were mounted in the TVAC and cooled to cryogenic test temperature and pressurized with helium while the leak rate was measured using a calibrated GHe leak detector.  The test articles for the initial proof of concept testing were ¼ and 1 inch Swagelok VCR fittings with three different types of seal rings copper, nickel, and Ni. Each fitting configuration (size/seal material) was subjected to two consecutive cryogenic thermal cycles, followed by exposure to a launch vibration profile at ambient temperature, after which two additional TVAC cycle tests were performed.  

The testing reported here is a continuation of the 2020 tests with a statistically significant large number of samples and test runs. Three Swagelok VCR fitting sizes were tested ¼, ½ and 1 inch, and five (5) samples of each fitting size, each sample was tested with SST and Ni seal rings (Total of 30 unique test articles).  Each test article was subjected to four (4) thermal cycles. Half of these cycles were performed before vibration testing and half were performed after vibration testing.  The vibration testing was performed to evaluate the ability of the fittings to survive launch-type vibration profiles and remain leak-free. Leak checking of each fitting was completed at temperatures between 20K – 30K. The test procedure in Section 8.0 was designed to facilitate a qualification test program by allowing a higher test throughput rate coupled with repeatable test profiles. 

Results were very positive and show that out of the 30 samples they all passed with leak rates a factor of 2-3 lower than the established 10-6sccs GHe leak threshold. The result showed the Ni seals had lower leak rate, but the SST was more rugged. There were two deviations where damage to the Ni seal ring during assembly resulted in a leaky fitting, this is discussed in Section 10.7 Test Deviations. These fittings show great promise for space flight use and further testing is recommended to fully qualify the fittings per the ASTM F1387-19 and/or other relevant NASA specifications.

The test equipment hardware and software capability developed for this testing is generic and not restricted to VCR fittings. It can be employed to evaluate/qualify the leak performance of other types of fittings and a wide range of other cryogenic fluid components such as valves, gages, connectors, etc."

Of the 11,416 sources studied in 3.75 hr of on-sky exposure time, 7438 are M31 sources with well-measured radial velocities. The observations reveal intricate coherent kinematic structure in the positions and velocities of individual stars: streams, wedges, and chevrons. While hints of coherent structures have been previously detected in M31, this is the first time they have been seen with such detail and clarity in a galaxy beyond the Milky Way. We find clear kinematic evidence for shell structures in the Giant Stellar Stream, the Northeast Shelf, and Western Shelf regions. The kinematics are remarkably similar to the predictions of dynamical models constructed to explain the spatial morphology of the inner halo. The results are consistent with the interpretation that much of the substructure in the inner halo of M31 is produced by a single galactic immigration event 1–2 Gyr ago. Significant numbers of metal-rich stars ([Fe/H] > − 0.5) are present in all of the detected substructures, suggesting that the immigrating galaxy had an extended star formation history. We also investigate the ability of the shells and Giant Stellar Stream to constrain the gravitational potential of M31, and estimate the mass within a projected radius of 125 kpc to be (log<sub>10</sub>) (M<sub>NEW</sub>) (<125 kpc)/(M<sub>ꙩ</sub>) =(11.80<sup>+0.12</sup><sub style='position: relative; left: -2.5em;'>−0.10</sub>).

These defects are often undetectable by battery management systems, prompting the need to advance nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques for battery applications. In this work, two ultrasonic approaches were compared to establish their relative merits for this application: local ultrasonic resonance spectroscopy, and guided wave ultrasound.  Benchtop experiments on batteries seeded with lithium chips emulating plating were used to demonstrate the two techniques.  The results show the ability to identify and map local changes in cell structure."

The technique leverages the fact that the solar radiation background signals from dense cirrus clouds are largely unpolarized due to the internal multiple reflections within the non-spherical ice particles and the multiple scattering that occurs among these particles. Therefore, the ratio of polarization components of the cirrus background signals provides a good estimate for the polarization gain ratio (PGR) of the lidar. Using airborne backscatter lidar measurements, this technique was demonstrated to work well in the infrared regime. However, in the visible and ultraviolet regime, the molecular contribution is too large to be ignored, and thus corrections must be applied to account for the highly polarizing characteristics of the molecular scattering. Ignoring  molecular scattering contributions can cause PGR errors of 2-3% at 532 nm, where the CALIPSO lidar makes its depolarization measurement. Because of the wavelength dependence of -4 of the molecular scattering, the PGR error can be even larger at the 355 nm wavelength that will be used by ESA’s EarthCARE lidar. To correct the molecular scattering contributions to the lidar received solar background signal, a look-up table has been created using a polarization-sensitive radiative transfer model. This presentation describes the theory and implementation of the molecular scattering correction."

However, sea ice processes and feedbacks with the ocean and the atmosphere can modulate this seasonal cycle. Here, the atmospheric feedbacks are quantified in a series of idealized sensitivity experiments performed with an eddy-permitting (1/4°) NEMO-LIM3 Southern Ocean configuration, including a representation of ice shelf cavities, in which the model was either driven by an atmospheric reanalysis or coupled to the COSMO-CLM<sup>2</sup> regional atmospheric model. In these experiments, sea ice thermodynamics and dynamics as well as the exchanges with the ocean and atmosphere are strongly perturbed. This perturbation is achieved by modifying snow and ice thermal conductivities, the vertical mixing in the ocean top layers, the effect of freshwater uptake/release upon sea ice growth/melt, ice dynamics and surface albedo. We show that the changes in surface heat fluxes are very different between the configurations driven by the reanalysis and those coupled to the atmosphere. Atmospheric feedbacks enhance the response of the modelled winter ice extent to any of the perturbed processes, and the enhancement is strongest when the albedo is modified. The response of sea ice volume and extent to changes in entrainment of subsurface warm waters to the ocean surface is also greatly amplified by the coupling with the atmosphere. By contrast, the atmospheric feedbacks can damp the impact of the perturbations affecting the heat conductivity through sea ice."

While industry requires robots that can perform repetitive tasks with precision and speed, the space environment needs robots to cope with uncertainties, dynamics, and communication delays or interruptions, similar to human astronauts. These demands make a well-suited application for compliant robotics and behavior-based programming. Pose Target Wrench Limiting (PTWL) is a compliant behavior paradigm developed specifically to meet these demands. PTWL controls a robot by moving a virtual attractor to a target pose. The attractor applies virtual forces, based on stiffness and damping presets, to an underlying admittance controller. Guided by virtual forces, the robot will follow the attractor until safety conditions are violated or success criteria are met. PTWL was tested on a variety of quasi-static and dynamic tasks that may be useful for future space operations. Results demonstrate that PTWL is a powerful tool. It makes teleoperation easy and safe for a wide range of quasi-static tasks. It also facilitates the creation of semi-autonomous state machines that can reliably complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention."

For EBCs with a silicon (Si) bond coat, a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer forms at the EBC –bond coat interface. The TGO layer is considered the weak interface, and directly influences the life of the EBC. Moreover, FOD has been shown to cause significant  subsurface  damage  resulting  in  delamination  or spallation of the EBC which can occur at the EBC -bond coat interface or the bond coat -substrate interface. The purpose of this work is to investigate the synergistic effects of oxidation and FOD in a ytterbium disilicate (𝑌𝑏2𝑆𝑖2𝑂7) EBC. FOD testing is conducted on as-deposited and steam oxidized samples at room temperature using a 1.59-mm hardened steel ball projectile.

Additionally,  a quasi-static, mechanical assessment of the EBC bond strength in the presence of a growing TGO is presented."

This method is not only tedious and time consuming for both the crew and ground teams but also results in inaccuracies in location and availability of medical supplies over time. Fortunately, the ISS is frequently resupplied by cargo launches and crew expeditions, and an accurate inventory count is less critical. However, for exploration missions, resupply will be greatly limited or unavailable entirely, and increasing communication latency will impair crew-ground communications. On longer missions, with large medical systems and time constrained crew, NASA needs a method of accurately managing medical inventory without reliance on ground teams and with as little crew time and effort as possible. 

The Exploration Medical Integrated Product Team (XMIPT) project called Medical Exploration Development and Implementation Scoping (MEDIScope) prepared a concept of operations and preliminary requirements for an Automated Medical Inventory System (AMIS) and completed a market survey and trade study of potential inventory management technologies in partnership with the market research firm, yet2.  The products from the MEDIScope effort, including the market survey results, preliminary functional requirements and a concept of operations, have been handed off to a development team at Glenn Research Center (GRC) and ZIN Technologies for technology maturation.

The top and bottom perforate layers have the same dimensions with aligned perforations while the middle layer perforate can be longitudinally shifted up to 0.075 inches to change the effective porosity of the facesheet. These configurations range in porosity from 100% open down to 10% open in addition to two closed configurations (0% porosity). Gaps are introduced between the facesheet layers ranging from no gap to 0.016 inches. These configurations are tested in the NASA Langley Grazing Flow Impedance Tube to determine their acoustic impedance spectra. Introduction of a gap affects the acoustic impedance of the liner where the resonant frequency of the liners decreases with increased gap thickness for liners with an open area ratio above 25% but increases with gap thickness for liners with an open area ratio below 25%. Additionally, it is observed that increasing the gap height results in a reduction of the effect of porosity on acoustic impedance. The results show that the presence of such gaps can have a significant effect on liner impedance especially as porosity decreases."

Marin County, located in the San Francisco Bay Area, has had significant development in the wildland-urban interface and periods of highly wildfire-prone conditions. The NASA DEVELOP team collaborated with Fire Foundry (a Marin-based fire service workforce development program) and the Marin County Fire Department to develop models to assist with fire management. Using data from Sentinel-2A, PlanetScope, ECOSTRESS, a county-wide LiDAR mapping effort, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), our team developed a number of input data layers for three different models to evaluate wildfire severity. One model performed a suitability analysis with weights based on scientific literature; another model utilized a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network trained on previous fires in Marin and neighboring Sonoma County to predict the difference normalized burn severity; and the third inputted data layers into the FlamMap tool that outputs risk categories. We compared model outputs and performed a weighted overlay analysis to identify specific locations where a fireline could be constructed to interrupt the progress of an active fire.

These nuclear power systems would generate heat from either the radioactive decay of isotopes or fission nuclear reactors. That heat would be converted to usable electricity using highly efficient Stirling convertors for a wide range of power needs needing 10s of watts to 50 kWe. NASA’s Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Program is maturing advanced thermoelectric and dynamic conversion technologies that would increase the system efficiency beyond what is currently possible using heritage systems to enable a larger number of robotic missions or higher power missions to solar system bodies of interest.

HEMM’s high performance is enabled by a field winding composed of 2nd generation high temperature superconducting (HTS) coils that are designed to operate at temperatures below 62 K. The superconducting rotor is conductively cooled to cryogenic temperatures using a rotating cryocooler embedded inside the machine’s shaft. This paper presents a static test of the full-scale superconducting rotor in a thermal vacuum chamber. The experimental setup is described in detail. Thermal and electromagnetic 3D finite element analyses of the experimental setup are shown along with a comparison of the model results to model results for HEMM. The thermal response during cool down from room temperature is discussed. Electrical measurements are presented for operation at different dc current excitations up to the rated current of the rotor (57.2 A) and temperature limit of the HEMM design (62 K). The results suggest that minor damage to one superconducting coil occurred at 50 A and 61.2 K, causing increased resistance in the system, but that the system could still be stably operated at 57.2 A and 62 K when conductively cooled by a cryocooler."

A 1.62%-scale model of the aircraft was fabricated for the wind tunnel test, which took place in the NASA Glenn 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel in September and October 2021. The model had provisions for being mounted by a swept blade strut that attached at top of model ahead of the inlet, or by a rear-entry sting that held the model at the location of the nacelle. The model had alternate parts for ±0.5° deflections of the flaps, ailerons, and stabilator, and ±1° deflections of the T-tail. Off-body static pressure measurements of the flow field below the model were made on a pressure rail which had 420 orifices along its tip. The model was positioned at various heights from the rail by vertical movement of the tunnel strut, and at various longitudinal stations relative to the rail by means of a linear actuator mounted between the wind tunnel strut and the balance. Spatial averaging of model pressure signatures acquired over a range of longitudinal positions reduced the effects of tunnel flow distortions and the interference of the rail flow field and shocks on the model pressure signatures. The test was run at approximate Mach numbers of 1.36, 1.4, and 1.47, and the model was set at various angles of attack and roll relative to the rail. Plots of the model signatures for representative variations of Mach number, model angles, control deflections, and height relative to the rail are provided throughout the report. Repeatability was generally very good and gave confidence in the quality of the measurements. The signatures measured at various heights from the rail provided insight into the aging of the model shocks as they propagated from 1.2 to 3 body lengths from the model. Off-track signatures up to 45° from centerline obtained by rolling the model gave indications of the shock flow fields across the width of the sonic boom carpet. The deflections of the various control surfaces allowed assessment of the boom sensitivity to the control surface movements."

This spacesuit is under development to support missions to the International Space Station (ISS) and also to the Moon. Improvements in the life and robustness of the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) has been a major objective of these efforts. The Suit Water Membrane Evaporator (SWME) was chosen as the technology to provide cooling to the xEMU and has undergone several iterations of development over this period. An ISS flight experiment centered around the SWME and other thermal control loop (TCL) technologies was developed and tested in an ISS EXpedite PRocessing of Experiments to the Space Station (EXPRESS) rack from November of 2020 to August of 2022.

438,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230005990,2023-08-03,Alternate Approach to Multi Layer Insulation Modeling to Reduce Node Count,"For models with a limitation on the overall node count, the typical approach to Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) modeling may generate nodes that are necessary for the analysis, but do not represent components of particular interest. This leaves fewer nodes that can be utilized to model components of greater importance than the MLI. A common approach to modeling MLI is to include a separate MLI node representing the outer layer of the insulation and a radiative coupling based on the area multiplied by an effective emissivity. Therefore, wherever insulation is included, one node is needed for the underlying surface and another node for the insulation. Since many spacecraft and instruments include MLI covering a sizable portion of their designs, this may result in a considerable number of nodes being used for MLI.

An alternate method to MLI modeling was developed that eliminates the MLI node, while still preserving the effect of the insulation for the underlying surface, thereby increasing the available nodes that could be used elsewhere in the model. This approach relies on preserving the baseline reflectivity, while reducing the absorptivity (based on the blanket effective emittance) and including a transparency. An inactive second surface is placed just behind the base surface that fully absorbs any energy that is transmitted without including its effect in the model. In essence, this approach applies only the energy that makes it through the blanket to the underlying surface. This method was tested out on the Roman Space Telescope model in local areas in preparation for its use in the generation of a launch model, which is constrained in the allowable node count. This paper documents the performance of the method and presents a comparison between the One-Node MLI method and the traditional two node MLI approach."

This individualized monitoring approach will inform targeted treatment strategies to maximize medical resource utilization by accounting for individual susceptibility to radiation-related illnesses.

As human spaceflight progresses beyond Earth’s magnetic shielding, radiation exposure poses a significant risk to astronaut health and safety. Extended operation in this environment comes with an increased risk of radiation exposure, leading to higher risks of radiation sickness, cancer, central nervous system effects, and degenerative diseases. While conventional physical dosimetry techniques capture radiation dose, individualistic susceptibility to radiation damage is varied. Multiple characteristics, including age, body weight, sex, genetics, and immune status, have been found to influence radiosensitivity (Liu et al. 2011, and Bouffler 2016). This differential response necessitates individualized monitoring and targeted treatment strategies to maximize medical resource utilization; however, a practical diagnostic platform for quantifying long-term, low dose radiation-induced tissue damage does not currently exist. 

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by mediating the degradation of messenger RNA. The levels of particular miRNAs are influenced by biological processes such as inflammation and serve as biomarkers for a variety of conditions including cancer (Singh et al. 2017). MicroRNAs are found in various bodily fluids and are amenable to collection via liquid biopsies, providing a minimally invasive and easily quantifiable readout for a variety of radiosensitive reporters. A preliminary signature of 15 spaceflight sensitive miRNA has been identified in rodent and human studies, including miR-21-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-16a-3p, miR-34a-3p, and miR-223-3p. These targets generally increased expression with radiation dose and linear energy transfer, though variation between individuals is not yet described.   

Current gaps in the field include a lack of understanding of longitudinal biological responses to long-term, low dose radiation exposure and the absence of space-compatible point-of-care technology for quantitative biological monitoring. In this body of work, we aim to develop an automated bleed-to-read system to process whole blood for the detection of miRNA biomarkers in order to monitor individualistic responses to radiation exposure. This will be achieved via separating serum (or plasma) from whole blood, followed by extraction, amplification, and quantification of the miRNA using a RT-qPCR reaction. Previously, the WetLab-2 hardware enabled execution of a RT-qPCR reaction aboard ISS; however, it is a manual system that requires crew manipulation and bulky components (Parra et al. 2017). To address these issues, automated fluid handling hardware was developed for each stage of sample preparation. Extraction of total RNA is achieved by sequentially pumping reagents through an off-the-shelf nucleic acid binding column (miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Advanced Kit, Qiagen). This approach eliminates several manual pipetting and centrifuging steps and limits the use of toxic chemicals commonly found in other sample processing techniques. The resulting elution will then be automatically dispensed for RT-qPCR analysis using a compact rotary qPCR (Mic qPCR Cycler, Bio Molecular Systems) that will improve spaceflight compatibility by removing bubbles from the detection region, another challenge highlighted by WetLab-2 (Parra et al. 2017). Efforts are also being made to simplify the RT-qPCR reaction to a 1-step air-dryable mix to improve long-term reagent stability at room temperature and reduce system complexity. 

By automating the RT-qPCR processes via microfluidic manipulation, RADREADS will reduce crewmember hands-on time and enable the personalized detection of radiation-induced tissue damage during long duration missions. Minimally invasive, longitudinal monitoring of individual’s response to radiation exposure will inform how the physiological system responds to long-term low dose space radiation and enables development of targeted countermeasures by the medical team.  Ultimately, this portable technology will require minimal technical expertise and can also be used to monitor miRNA biomarkers associated with other diseases."

The performance targets for this machine are 25 kW/kg and 99% efficiency. The concept design is a partially superconducting machine that builds on NASA’s  past  work  on  its  High  Efficiency  Megawatt  Motor(HEMM). A   partially superconducting machine design tool is used to create a preliminary concept design capable of  achieving  the  target  specifications  for  the  SUSAN  generator.

As a result of declining lake levels, over 50% of the lakebed is now exposed. Dust storms may grow in frequency and intensity across Northern Utah as lakebed dust becomes airborne under specific meteorological conditions. In our research project, we utilized satellite imagery from Terra and Aqua, Sentinel-5P, CALIPSO, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI-2, Suomi NPP, ground sensor environmental data, and demographic data to understand the relationship between lake desiccation and dust, and the impact of pollution upon the communities surrounding the Great Salt Lake. By plotting changes in Lake Surface Area against Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over our study period (2010-2022), we found an inverse relationship (R2=0.3423) between lake surface area and dust levels within our study area. We conducted a Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) and Extinction Coefficient Plot, from which we identified that during dust events, the aerosol type is mainly polluted dust and the aerosol height is 200 meters from the surface. Lastly, we created bivariate choropleth maps, which demonstrate which census tracts within our study area are most vulnerable to AOD (a proxy for PM2.5 from dust), NO2 and HCHO (precursors to ozone). In summary, our findings revealed that declining lake levels are associated with an increase in intensity of dust events, and these dust events will particularly impact residents of Tooele County and the west side of Salt Lake City. Project resources support partner needs by informing targeted air monitoring efforts, lakebed management practices, and advocacy efforts for GSL stewardship."

The heat exchanger transfers heat from the ventilation gas to the thermal control loop via a miniature shell-and-tube heat exchanger.  The flow meters calculate the flow rate of gas through the ventilation loop based on the pressure drop across the heat exchanger core.  Creare has delivered four design validation test (DVT) heat exchangers and five DVT flow meters to NASA JSC to support development of the exploration portable life support system (xPLSS). This paper describes the design and performance of the DVT units.The heat exchangers are designed to cool the ventilation gas to a specified temperature with low pressure losses under the most challenging operating conditions.  The measured performance of the DVT heat exchangers agrees well with design models and meets all performance requirements. The flow meters use a MEMS thermal flow sensor to produce a signal that is proportional to a small bypass flow around the heat exchanger core.  They are designed to achieve high measurement accuracy across the full range of xPLSS operating conditions.  We calibrated the flow meters in a special-purpose flow facility that simulates operation in the xPLSS ventilation loop.  Calibration testing shows that DVT flow meters produce digital output for vent loop mass flow that meets NASA’s accuracy requirements across the range of xPLSS operating conditions. This paper reviews the design of the heat exchangers and flow meters and presents data from the final flow meter calibration testing, heat exchanger performance validation, and initial ground testing in NASA’s xPLSS."

We applied a novel approach with terrestrial water storage observations from the GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites to delineate and characterize 1,056 extreme events during 2002-2021.  Dwarfing all other events was an ongoing pluvial that began in 2019 and engulfed central Africa.  Total intensity of extreme events was strongly correlated with global mean temperature, more so than with the El Nino Southern Oscillation or other climate indicators, suggesting that continued warming of the planet will cause more frequent, more severe, longer, and/or larger droughts and pluvials.  In three regions, including a vast swath extending from southern Europe to southwestern China, the ratio of wet to dry extreme events decreased substantially over the study period, while the opposite was true in two regions, including sub-Saharan Africa from 5°N to 20°N."

We use CMB simulations with noise representative of three experiments—the Planck satellite, the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS), and the LiteBIRD satellite—to test how current and future data constrain the anomalies. We find the correlation coefficients ρ between temperature and E-mode estimators to be less than 0.1, except for the point-parity asymmetry (ρ = 0.17 for cosmic-variance-limited simulations), confirming that E-modes provide a check on the anomalies that is largely independent of temperature data. Compared to Planck component-separated CMB data (smica), the putative LiteBIRD survey would reduce errors on E-mode anomaly estimators by factors of ∼3 for hemispherical power asymmetry and point-parity asymmetry, and by ∼26 for lack of large-scale correlation. The improvement in Q–O alignment is not obvious due to large cosmic variance, but we found the ability to pin down the estimator value will be improved by a factor ≳100. Improvements with CLASS are intermediate to these."

This mission will advance the understanding of the electromagnetic space environment at the Moon in support of the Artemis program, exploration, and the geosciences. Here we present the science rationale motivating the mission. The candidate mission science objectives include: (1) constrain the origins of crustal magnetic fields; (2) determine the nature of plasma interactions with crustal magnetic fields; (3) characterize plasma waves and turbulence at the Moon; (4) characterize the lunar surface electric potential in varying plasma environments; (5) constrain the composition, thermal state, and structure of the lunar upper mantle and crust; (6) characterize the ionizing radiation in lunar orbit; and lastly, (7) determine the density of the dust exosphere as a function of latitude, longitude, and altitude, including the lunar polar space environment. The measurement requirements include simultaneous two-point observations of the 3-component vector magnetic field, plasma distribution (flux, energy, density, temperature), and single-point observations of energetic particles (protons, electrons, gamma rays), and dust. These measurements are important because it helps us understand how future astronauts, robots, and space hardware will live and work on the lunar surface."

Each model is perturbed by uniformly increasing the sea surface temperature by 4 K. The simulated cloud fraction, the perturbed states and cloud radiative kernels are used to derive cloud feedback in the shortwave (SW), longwave (LW) and their sum (Net). Compared to AMIP5, the cloud fraction in AMIP6 increases by 9.1%, while the perturbation leads to a 0.25% decrease. The Net cloud feedback at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) is almost double (174%). Statistical tests support that this change is mainly due to an increase in the surface SW cloud feedback caused by optically thick, middle and low clouds. The contribution of the atmospheric Net component (12%) stems from the increase in the atmospheric LW cloud feedback, likely to play a role in weakening (strengthening) the northward (southward) meridional atmospheric energy transport, while the opposite is true for the surface LW and Net cloud feedback in the meridional oceanic energy transport. The substantial increase in cloud feedback at the TOA primarily contributes to the higher climate sensitivity. The cloud feedback spread in AMIP6 is comparable to that in AMIP5."

However, establishing a solid physical connection between solar and tropospheric variability has posed a considerable challenge across the spectrum of Earth-system science. Over the past few years a new picture to describe solar variability has developed, based on observing, understanding and tracing the progression, interaction and intrinsic variability of the magnetized activity bands that belong to the Sun’s 22-year magnetic activity cycle. A solar cycle’s fiducial clock does not run from the canonical min or max, instead resetting when all old cycle polarity magnetic flux is cancelled at the equator, an event dubbed the “termination” of that solar cycle, or terminator. In a recent paper, we demonstrated with high statistical significance, a correlation between the occurrence of termination of the last five solar cycles and the transition from El Niño to La Niña in the Pacific Ocean, and predicted that there would be a transition to La Niña in mid 2020. La Niña did indeed begin in mid-2020, and endured into 2023 as a rare “triple dip” event, but some of the solar predictions made did not occur until late 2021. This work examines what went right, what went wrong, the correlations between El Niño, La Niña and geomagnetic activity indices, and what might be expected for the general trends of large-scale global climate in the next decade."

The survey data consists of eighty-channel detector plane histograms that accumulate photon counts over time periods of at least 5 minutes. These histograms are processed on the ground and are used to produce the survey dataset between 14 and 195 keV. Survey data comprises > 90% of all
BAT data by volume and allows for the tracking of long term light curves and spectral properties of cataloged and uncataloged hard X-ray sources. Until now, the survey dataset has not been used to its full potential due to the complexity associated with its analysis and the lack of easily usable pipelines. Here, we introduce the BatAnalysis python package, a wrapper for HEASoftpy, which provides a modern, open-source pipeline to process and analyze BAT survey data. BatAnalysis allows
members of the community to use BAT survey data in more advanced analyses of astrophysical sources including pulsars, pulsar wind nebula, active galactic nuclei, and other known/unknown transient events that may be detected in the hard X-ray band. We outline the steps taken by the python code and exemplify its usefulness and accuracy by analyzing survey data from the Crab Nebula, NGC 2992, and a previously uncataloged MAXI Transient. The BatAnalysis package allows for ∼ 18 years of BAT survey to be used in a systematic way to study a large variety of astrophysical sources."

One of the more recent advancements has been with reusable sorbents being regenerated with a combination of heat and vacuum. One such technology is the Thermal Amine Scrubber (TAS) flight experiment on the ISS, though several others are currently flying or preparing to fly. A model was created of the TAS to predict chemical performance, using fundamental chemistry and physics based on principles rather than  empirical relations. Since the physical laws are true across all conditions, such a model enables greater model accuracy outside the bounds of test data, and allows for virtual testing of the hardware at conditions that are prohibitively difficult or expensive to actually test. This paper details the model’s development, operation, and correlation to data from the flight unit. The model is then compared to a data set taken from the flight unit under different flow, CO2 partial pressure, and bed configuration conditions, resulting in only a 2% error. The equations and principles laid forth in this paper are applicable to a wide range of thermally regenerated sorbents, and additional models of a similar nature would allow for potentially the most straightforward and direct method of comparison of technologies available to date."

Fast-to-flight demonstrations of each aspect of the work are carried out during hands-on crew interaction with flight scale hardware on ISS during the 2022-2023 timeframe.

Using this argumentation, many observation-based land surface studies avoid satellite-observed soil moisture. Here, based on peer-reviewed literature across several fields, we argue that such a viewpoint is overly limiting for two reasons. First, microwave soil emission depth considerations and statistical considerations of vertically correlated soil moisture information together indicate that L-band measurements carry information about soil moisture extending below the commonly referenced 5 cm in many conditions. However, spatial variations of effective depths of representation remain uncertain. Second, in reviewing isotopic tracer field studies of plant water uptake, we find a prevalence of vegetation that primarily draws moisture from these upper soil layers. This is especially true for grasslands and croplands covering more than a third of global vegetated surfaces. Even some deeper-rooted species (i.e., shrubs and trees) preferentially or seasonally draw water from the upper soil layers. Therefore, L-band satellite soil moisture estimates are more relevant to global vegetation water uptake than commonly appreciated (i.e., relevant beyond only shallow soil processes like soil evaporation). Our commentary encourages the application of satellite soil moisture across a broader range of terrestrial hydrosphere and biosphere studies while urging more rigorous estimates of its effective depth of representation."

This paper details the testing of the TS at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) including the vibration (vibe) test, pre-vibe thermal vacuum (t-vac) cycle test, post-vibe t-vac cycle test, and long duration t-vac cycle test. The data collected from the pre- and post-vibe tests are compared to show the impact of the vibe test on performance. The data collected from the long duration test is used to calculate the total thermal contact conductance through the TS interfaces for both ‘on’ (TS closed, during hot plateau) and ‘off’ (TS open, during cold plateau) configurations, and the turndown ratio is also calculated. Challenges experienced throughout testing are also discussed."

In addition to water, these overshoots also transport various chemical species, affecting chemistry and radiation in the stratosphere. It is not currently known, however, how much transport is a result of this mechanism. To better understand overshooting convection, this study aims to characterize the durations of overshooting events. To achieve this, radar data from the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) network is composited onto a three-dimensional grid at 5-min intervals. Overshoots are identified by comparing echo-top heights with tropopause estimates derived from ERA5 reanalysis data. These overshoots are linked in space from one analysis time to the next to form tracks. This process is performed for 12 four-day sample windows in the months May–August of 2017–19. Track characteristics such as duration, overshoot area, tropopause-relative altitude, and column-maximum reflectivity are investigated. Positive correlations are found between track duration and other track characteristics. Integrated track volume is found as a product of the overshoot area, depth, and duration, and provides a measure of the potential stratospheric impact of each track. Short-lived tracks are observed to contribute the most total integrated volume when considering track duration, while tracks that overshoot by 2–3 km show the largest contribution when considering overshoot depth. A diurnal cycle is observed, with peak track initiation around 1600–1700 local time. Track-mean duration peaks a few hours earlier, while track-mean area and tropopause-relative height peak a few hours later."

It describes some of the adjustments that were necessary to match the system hardware, as well as next steps in verification and validation. The outputs of the model were compared to the results of several tests in HyPER, and in the process captured an additional torque loss that is still being analyzed for the root cause but has been confirmed in the hardware.

Each of these models was used to perform a series of aerosol perturbation experiments, in which emissions of different aerosol types (sulfate, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon) in different northern mid-latitude source regions, and of biomass burning aerosol over South America and Africa, were substantially reduced or eliminated. We find that the Arctic warms in nearly every experiment, the only exceptions being the U.S. and Europe BC experiments in GFDL-CM3 in which there is a weak and insignificant cooling. The Arctic warming is generally larger than the global mean warming (i.e. Arctic amplification occurs), particularly during non-summer months. The models agree that changes in the poleward atmospheric moisture transport are the most important factor explaining the spread in Arctic warming across experiments: the largest warming tends to coincide with the largest increases in moisture transport into the Arctic. In contrast, there is an inconsistent relationship (correlation) across experiments between the local radiative forcing over the Arctic and the simulated Arctic warming, with this relationship being positive in one model (GFDL-CM3) and negative in the other two. Our results thus highlight the prominent role of poleward energy transport in driving Arctic warming and amplification, and suggest that the relative importance of poleward energy transport and local forcing/feedbacks is likely to be model dependent."

These new services need a language to represent and deconflict trajectories, and a common language will simplify coordination between the new airspace domains as well as traditional airspace.  A Trajectory Specification Language (TSL) was  previously  proposed  for  traditional  air  traffic,  and  it  can  also  serve  as  a  common language for the new aviation domains and services.  The TSL specifies a reference trajectory in 4D space along with spatial tolerances that determine a bounding volume at any given time in flight.  The tolerances are defined in terms of the route-oriented cross-track, along-track, and vertical axes, and they are allowed to vary with distance along the route.

Artemis missions to the lunar orbit or surface will expose the radiators to high energy UV radiation and dust, which will degrade the radiator’s coating emissivity and consequently reduce heat rejection performance. In addition, subfreezing environmental temperatures during transit to lunar orbit and nighttime on lunar south pole can rupture coolant tubes, reduce heat rejection performance, and worst-case scenario result in a Loss of Mission (LOM). Louver technology would be a promising solution to maintaining radiator performance and integrity for Artemis missions, but heritage louvers are passively controlled. This technology needs maturing to active control, or motor actuation, to achieve faster thermal response times. Actively controlled louver design considerations are discussed in this paper. The analysis that follows shows actively controlled louvers can attenuate high energy UV radiation and dust, as well as protect the coolant from freezing."

The complexity and integrated nature of the partial turboelectric powertrain architecture presents failure modes and hazards not found in conventional aircraft propulsion designs. Previously, various electrical and mechanical faults and associated recovery modes were demonstrated in a dynamic model of the powertrain. It was shown that certain faults were catastrophic without recovery logic, due specifically to the interaction of the subsystems. However, in each case, the logic, known as a reversionary control mode, enabled continued operation with assumed sufficient thrust to maintain safe flight. The current work evaluates the powertrain faults and recovery strategies using a full aircraft model in a piloted flight simulator, and places it in the context of current regulatory practice. Faults initiated in flight were successfully mitigated, with the accommodated aircraft subsequently evaluated against certification requirements for three-engine aircraft, which were shown to be appropriate for the STARC-ABL configuration."

The Robotic Refueling Mission–3 (RRM3) experiment launched in 2018 and was designed to demonstrate tank self-pressurization during storage and active cooling of liquid methane in microgravity. Creating accurate models using existing datasets from flight experiments such as RRM3 is a vital step toward developing appropriate modeling tools to form pre-test predictions for future flight systems. The goal of this work was to create a working model in Thermal Desktop of the RRM3 source Dewar during the microgravity self-pressurization experiment. The pressure rise, temperature distribution of the fluid inside the tank, and the wall temperatures were all tracked and compared with test data.  Initial results show good agreement between each of these metrics and the experimental results. This work is ongoing and will yield further insights into the thermal behavior of cryogens in microgravity."

A teaming partnership with JPL has been established to study and develop a compelling application of the ADEPT mechanically deployable hypersonic decelerator as part of the Venus Drag Modulated Aerocapture (VDMA) JPL R&TD effort. The primary work of this activity is to develop a design tool for the ADEPT drag skirt  (e.g. a CFD-anchored CBAERO model) that enables rapid estimation of aerothermal environments for a range of candidate trajectories. This capability will enable rapid feasibility trades and design assessments for early stage mission concept evaluation for ADEPT Drag Modulated Aerocapture applications.  Results of using TPSizer provided an ADEPT carbon fabric design thickness of the required number of fabric layers needed for predicted aerothermal environments and still have sufficient fabric remaining for overall vehicle integrity.  This resulted in aerothermal design closure of the ADEPT drag skirt.  In addition, the similar methodology for Venus DMA was used to assess a similar DMA operation at Earth as part of a possible Technology Demonstration Mission (TDM) for ADEPT DMA.  This analysis showed that there is a close similarity of design approaches for an Earth DMA TDM that would be applicable to Venus DMA mission designs."

We identify 11 of these jets as blowout jets and four as standard jets (with six uncertain), based on their X-ray-spire widths being respectively wide or narrow (compared to the jet’s base) in the XRT images. From corresponding Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), essentially all (at least 20 of 21) of the jets are made by minifilament eruptions,consistent with other recent studies. Here, we examine the detailed nature of the erupting minifilaments (EMFs) in the jet bases. Wide-spire (“blowout”) jets often have ejective EMFs, but sometimes they instead have an EMF that is mostly confined to the jet’s base rather than ejected. We also demonstrate that narrow-spire (“standard”) jets can have either a confined EMF, or a partially confined EMF where some of the cool minifilament leaks into the jet’s spire. Regarding EMF visibility: we find that in some cases the minifilament is apparent in as few as one of the four EUV channels we examined, being essentially invisible in the other channels; thus it is necessary to examine images from multiple EUV channels before concluding that a jet does not have an EMF at its base. The size of the EMFs, measured projected against the sky and early in their eruption, is 14′′ ± 7′′, which is within a factor of two of other measured sizes of coronal-jet EMFs.  A full report on these results will be published in the Astrophysical Journal.  This work was supported by NASA's HGI, HSR, and HSOC programs, and by the NASA/MSFC Hinode Project."

Astronaut activities in low Earth orbit resupply consumable materials and can require alternative technologies if transportation of chemicals is deemed hazardous. Plasma technology and applications are able to generate commodities that assist in achieving Earth independence. Plasma interaction with water generates acid in-situ using on-board resources of electricity and breathable air without the need for large infrastructure. At Kennedy Space Center, researchers have shown that plasma is able to produce nitric acid, and therefore nitrates, in a plant-usable form in water.

Multiyear La Niña events in particular may be both predictable at long lead times and favor drought in the bimodal rainfall regions of East Africa. However, SST patterns in the tropical Pacific and adjacent ocean basins often differ substantially between first- and second-year La Niñas, which can change how these events affect regional climate. Here, we demonstrate that multiyear La Niña events favor drought in the Horn of Africa in three consecutive seasons [October–December (OND), March–May (MAM), OND]. But they do not tend to increase the probability of a fourth season of drought owing to the sea surface temperatures and associated atmospheric teleconnections in the MAM long rains season following second-year La Niña events. First-year La Niñas tend to have both greater subsidence over the Horn of Africa, associated with warmer waters in the west Pacific that enhance the Walker circulation, and greater cross-continental moisture transport, associated with a warm tropical Atlantic, as compared to second-year La Niñas. Both the increased subsidence and enhanced cross-continental moisture transport favors drought in the Horn of Africa. Our results provide a physical understanding of the sources and limitations of predictability for using multiyear La Niña forecasts to predict drought in the Horn of Africa."

Existing tools for the coupling of the NASA OVERFLOW structured overset RANS solver and LASTRAC stability analysis code have been extended to capture boundary-layer transition in high-speed flows driven by either Mack’s first-mode or secondmode instabilities and/or crossflow instabilities. The efficacy of this coupled approach has been demonstrated by examining a variety of supersonic and hypersonic test cases for which experimental validation data is available. The intermittency prescription parameters inherited from prior low-speed applications are found to be suitable for some, but not all high-speed flow scenarios. The method is found to be robust for straight cone configurations and improvements necessary to accurately capture transition on geometries with spatially complex amplification factor envelopes with intermediate regions of slow N-factor variation are examined. The automated, coupled analysis is demonstrated for a 3d supersonic test case and found to perform well within the limits of the linear stability analysis on which it relies. Finally, a preliminary investigation of the method’s robustness to non-ideal CFD meshes is conducted."

New technologies will be necessary to extend planning and execution capabilities for lunar surface activities. The Joint Augmented Reality Visual Informatics System (Joint AR) at NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) is one such technology. Joint AR is a suit-mounted augmented reality (AR) display and compute system which facilitates unprecedented information exchange and data visualization capabilities between mission support operators and suited crew.

This paper describes challenges associated with developing an AR technology for an envisioned work domain by applying a sociotechnical lens to the iterative testing and development of novel AR technology through virtual reality (VR). A foundational VR testbed was established, providing a high-fidelity approximation of the lunar surface and enabling testing of envisioned AR system features in parallel with real world product development. Using this environment, a series of human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted using VR to deploy a notional AR system supporting use cases envisioned for lunar exploration extravehicular activity (xEVA).

Our findings indicate VR is a powerful and immersive tool for testing capabilities which extend beyond the limitations of current AR technology. Our VR testbed enables early testing of proposed system features, advancing identification of high-value features and driving present-day development of Joint AR. Future work directions are discussed, including lessons learned and a roadmap for an iterative research and development approach applying VR (among other testbeds) to accelerate Joint AR system maturation."

The method can be applied to most existing models with pressure taps, and only requires that a fine angle-of-attack sweep be performed.  A small but abrupt change in the static pressure is visible when the transition front passes over the pressure tap.  Results from a recent Juncture Flow test entry are used to illustrate the technique.  Infrared thermography measurements of the transition front compare very well to the transition locations obtained from the static pressure ports.  Some differences in behavior occur depending on the dominant transition mechanism.  While the technique is somewhat qualitative, it can be an excellent tool for estimating the transition location when other tools are not readily available.  Given the simplicity of the technique, and the fact that most wind-tunnel models are already designed with numerous static pressure taps, this method can be applied with very little overhead."

Failure to do so may result in events such as compressor stall/surge and combustor blow out. Transient operability concerns constrain the engine design and can result in sacrifices of efficiency and/or thrust responsiveness. The traditional approach to transient operability management is control logic that limits the fuel flow command. A companion paper presents a strategy for optimizing the transient fuel flow control logic taking into consideration transient operability and thrust responsiveness. The study covered here extends this idea to an electrified gas turbine engine that employs a power/energy management concept known as Turbine Electrified Energy Management (TEEM). TEEM uses an electric power system interfaced with the engine (hence the term ‘electrified gas turbine engine’) to further improve transient operability and alleviate associated design constraints. There can be costs associated with implementing TEEM in terms of power and energy requirements that impact the size of the electrical power system. However, the results of this study show that through optimization of the transient limit logic, power and energy requirements needed to implement TEEM can be significantly reduced. Among the conclusions that can be drawn from the results of the illustrative application covered herein are: (1) there is a reduction in the electric machine power requirement to manage operability during accelerations by 200 to 400 hp, and (2) power transfer from the low pressure spool (LPS) to the high pressure spool (HPS) is the most effective option for improving operability during decelerations, followed by the options of only injecting power on the HPS or only extracting power from the LPS."

These ambitious goals will require significant changes in in-flight medical care due to constraints on mass, volume, power, crew time, and medical evacuation capabilities. Furthermore, while crews currently rely on real-time communications with ground-based medical providers, as distance from Earth increases, so do communication delays and disruptions. The crew will need to autonomously detect, diagnose, treat, and prevent medical events. These constraints require development of transformative solutions and new technologies. 

Through participation in the Human Research Program’s (HRP) Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) research, NASA has developed and demonstrated a Medical Data Architecture (MDA), a platform upon which a robust capability of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) can be built. As a result, NASA is now positioned to build an advanced autonomous CDS System (CDSS) which will aid in crew health decision-making. 

The CDSS combines data management aspects of a system that would lead to the autonomy required by NASA-STD-3001, Section 3, Health and Medical Care Standards.

Two modeling approaches are explored: the unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (URANS) with Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model closure, and a hybrid Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes/Large Eddy Simulation (RANS/LES) paradigm employing a Zonal Detached Eddy Simulation (ZDES) closure with enhanced shielding protection. Fan stage performance metrics, aerodynamic quantities and turbulent flow structures are analyzed in this work. Initial studies focusing on grid and time-step sensitivity are presented. Sensitivity to different variants of the SA turbulence model is analyzed, supporting the use of the baseline SA model in the production runs. Two conditions are analyzed in detail using URANS and hybrid RANS/LES (HRLES). Mean flow quantities are well-captured by both methods in the low-speed (approach) regime. While URANS misses all the upstream-propagating noise in the inlet due to the rotor-locked tones being evanescent in nature at subsonic fan tip speeds, HRLES captures this broadband component in its pressure field. At the high-speed (sideline) condition, URANS shows better agreement with the SDT data than HRLES in the interstage flow-field. In this regime, URANS captures the tonal content propagating through the inlet, since the tones are now cut-on. Both methods are suitable to capture fan stage performance metrics and mean flow quantities, but only HRLES is able to resolve the fine turbulent structures responsible for broadband noise. The results support the use of the sliding mesh technique implemented in this work for future turbomachinery applications within the LAVA solver framework."

NASA’s Deputy Administrator and Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate tasked the Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy with answering two questions related to the Artemis campaign: (1) what technical and policy considerations should NASA take into account in the selection of lunar landing and operations sites, and (2) what technical and policy considerations should NASA take into account when implementing tools such as safety zones in order to protect these operations and U.S. interests?

We present policy tools (options and recommendations) to NASA leadership and program planners so that they can consider policy measures to respond to challenges inherent in landing and operating at the lunar South Pole—this answers question one.

A second order accurate, non-dissipative finite volume discretization is used to systematically investigate the effects of different polyhedral Voronoi mesh types using a sequence of three canonical problems with increasing complexity. First, inviscid isentropic vortex propagation is studied to demonstrate the substantial reduction of errors for rhombic dodecahedron and truncated octahedral cell types over Cartesian hexagonal cells of identical spacing. Furthermore, the reduction of errors induced at cell-size transitions (grid-coarsening interfaces) due to Lloyd smoothing iterations is quantified. It is shown that by utilizing an appropriate viscous flux discretization, a constant coefficient subgrid scale model is sufficient for non-linear stability at the 2:1 cell-size transitions on polyhedral grids, although some further error reduction does occur when smoothing is utilized. Next, forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence at an asymptotically large Reynolds number is studied to demonstrate the non-dissipative character of the inviscid flux discretization, and the non-linear robustness and accuracy offered by the viscous flux discretization using a subgrid scale model for all three Voronoi grid types. Finally, Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulations (WMLES) are performed to study the high-lift aerodynamics on the McDonnell Douglas 30P30N multi-element airfoil at two distinct grid levels and for two distinct Voronoi cell types. The formulation is shown to predict the aerodynamic loading with high accuracy at all angles of attack when sufficient resolution is reached, and the hexagonal prism grid topology, while  computationally more expensive, has higher effective resolution compared to the Cartesian grid topology with the same spacing."

To date, most Wild 2 particles available for study are relatively large and coherent particles extracted individually from the ends of hollow, carrot-shaped impact tracks produced during impact into aerogel. However, >65% of the impacting mass can be found in the ‘bulb’ of the track, including nearly all of the <1 μm size fraction [2]. This fraction contains organic-rich material and is likely to include presolar grains, representing a critical opportunity to constrain the organic and presolar inventory of primitive outer solar system materials. However, the small size and susceptibility of this fraction to melting or alteration during capture poses significant analytical challenges.   

Previous attempts to extract and concentrate fine-grained material from the bulb of Stardust tracks have attempted to develop techniques that efficiently destroy aerogel and leave impactor particles relatively unharmed. The low density and high porosity of silica aerogel makes it more susceptible to attack by etching with hydrofluoric acid (HF) [3] or CF4 plasma ashing [4] than collected cometary silicates. Previous studies of HF vapor etching used HF solutions varying between 5 to 49% and noted that at high concentrations and etch rates, a liquid droplet was produced according to the etching reaction 4HF + SiO2 → SiF4 (g) + 2H2O [3]. SiF4 readily decomposes into HF and silicic acid in water, which has the potential to alter the freed cometary silicates. The plasma ashing technique avoids production of a liquid droplet and minimizes damage to embedded silicates but requires specialized equipment [4].

In this abstract, we present recent improvements to the HF etching procedure with the aim of constructing an etching chamber capable of slowly etching silica aerogel using small quantities of dilute HF. The etching chamber can be assembled using readily available materials."

The primary human performance-related risks involve deconditioning of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscles systems due to prolonged exposure to the reduced gravitational input. The chronological history of U.S. space flight is reviewed as a starting point to inform and understand the gaps in the knowledge to these risks.  

Maintenance of physical performance capabilities involves understanding the health of many organ systems (peripheral [vascular, heart, blood volume, skeletal muscle] and central [brain]) that ultimately contribute to the submaximal and maximal capacity of the aerobic (VO2peak), skeletal muscle (strength and endurance) systems. Maintaining astronaut VO2peak, muscle mass, strength, and endurance before, during, and after space flight is a significant priority to NASA for the current International Space Station (ISS) era, as well as for future exploration missions. A growing research database from both space flight and ground-based analog studies finds that the cardiorespiratory system is compromised and skeletal muscles (predominantly postural muscles of the lower limbs) undergo atrophy. These structural and metabolic responses to living in microgravity conditions contribute to physiological deconditioning during space flight that potentially increase the risks to astronauts returning to surface operations (i.e., Moon, Mars, or Earth). The time course changes from short to long-duration space flight and the relationships between in-flight performance deconditioning levels are not well characterized. Moreover, there are large interindividual variabilities that may be dependent on genetics, age, sex, preflight fitness levels, and individual exercise prescriptions that need further careful evaluations. Efforts should be made to understand the current status of preflight, in-flight, and postflight exercise performance capability and to define the operational goals and target areas for protection with the in-flight exercise program.

There is a bi-directional relationship between exercise prescription and hardware countermeasures that need further understanding in-flight. For example, hardware with limited capabilities/modalities may be counterbalanced by changes in exercise prescription (i.e., frequency, time, intensity, volume) for providing effective responses to maintain fitness. Importantly, the minimal requirements for exercise prescription on ISS hardware may not translate to lower capability hardware on exploration missions. Due to limited volume on exploration vehicles, future Artemis missions to the Lunar surface will not have similar exercise hardware capabilities as ISS. This may alter the effectiveness of hardware to provide adequate physiological stress on  bodily systems  allowing for adaptations to maintain aerobic capacity, strength, and bone density. Thus, it will be important to understand the exercise responses of current ISS countermeasures to develop individualized exercise prescriptions that minimize aerobic and muscular risks, accounting for the large variability of responses among crewmembers. Newer exploration exercise hardware is currently being evaluated that is more compact (i.e., E4D and Orion Flywheel) and will require careful evaluation of  the hardware on the stressor (i.e., metabolic rate, oxygen uptake, and heart rate work relationships, and force plate load profiles) needed the human body to protect and maintain crew health and performance. Moreover, exercise responses on the hardware need careful evaluation on the chronic adaptations. Lastly, in-flight evaluation of hardware exercise response may differ in 0-g or partial-g compared to 1-g. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the stress on the body will be the same in each environment. Understanding this has a direct impact on exercise prescriptions.

This document provides an overview of key scientific investigations that have been conducted before, during, and after human space flight missions, as well as from human ground-based analog studies that contribute to the evidence base on changes in aerobic capacity and muscle mass, strength, and endurance. Additional data from rodent and nonhuman primate experiments of skeletal muscle unloading completed during space flight or ground-based flight-simulations provide supportive information about this risk topic. Most importantly, a recent, large dataset from long-duration ISS crew has been added to give improved insight into the variability of exercise response of crew, demonstrating that a large portion of the crew population return to Earth with greater than 10-20% loss of aerobic capacity and muscle strength and endurance. Data from human space flight and ground-based studies are narrowing in on the required exercise paradigms but thus far still provide an incomplete answer to an effective approach for maintaining skeletal muscle function and aerobic fitness of all human space travelers. Finally, the relationship of this risk topic to various space flight operational scenarios is examined and discussed."

In this paper, we present our work on improving the formal requirements specification experience in PLCverif through the use of natural language. To this end, we integrate NASA’s FRET, a formal requirement elicitation and authoring tool, into PLCverif. FRET is used to specify formal requirements in structured natural language, which automatically translates into temporal logic formulae. FRET’s output is then directly used by PLCverif for verification purposes. We discuss practical challenges that PLCverif users face when authoring requirements and the FRET features that help alleviate these problems. We present the new requirement formalization workflow and report our experience using it on two critical CERN case studies."

Due to decreasing O availability at these low fO2, and an abundance of S(sup 2(-)), sulfur (S) acts as an important anion that changes the partitioning behavior of many elements and modifies the physical properties of silicate melts. Preliminary observations suggest that major and minor elements exhibit different geochemical affinities in highly reduced, S-rich systems compared to terrestrial rocks. The speciation and bonding environment of S, dictated by P/T/fO2 conditions, may strongly influence the degree to which S affects partitioning behavior.

Here we investigate the partitioning behavior of major, minor, and trace elements between silicate melt, sulfide melt, and metal as well as the coordination chemistry of S in highly reduced silicate melts. Our work is focused on investigating solely the entropy-dependent temperature effect on partitioning of elements for which we currently have MESSENGER data (K, Na, Th, U, Si, Mg, Fe, Ti, Ca, Al, Cr, Mn, S, Cl) as well as a host of geochemically relevant trace elements such as REEs (P, Co, Ni, Mo, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Yb). Previous studies in which temperature, pressure, and fO2 were co-varied found that as fO2 decreases, heat-producing elements U and Th become more chalcophile, while K becomes less chalcophile. Concurrently, nominally lithophile elements Mg and Ca become more chalcophile and were observed as minor elements in exsolved sulfides and bonded with S species in silicate melt. These studies, however, could not disentangle entropic effects from changes in the fO2. New temperature-dependent partitioning data from our work will be used to determine which elements are most likely to retain their lithophile character and hence be incorporated into silicates, and which elements are likely contained within the sulfide (chalcophile) and metal core (siderophile), setting the stage for the thermal and magmatic evolution of reduced planetary bodies."

Capabilities of the HIMIT are demonstrated here by testing three classes of acoustic liners: a narrow chamber liner, conventional single degree of freedom liners, and over-the-rotor liners. The experimental results are compared to results in NASA Langley's Normal Incidence Tube (NIT) for validation. The Zwikker and Kosten Transmission Line (ZKTL) model is also compared to the HIMIT results for selected configurations to study its applicability at high SPLs and frequencies. The HIMIT and NIT impedance spectra compare favorably up to 3.0 kHz, which is the upper frequency limit of the NIT analysis. The ZKTL model was used at frequencies up to 6.0 kHz and showed great comparison for the entire frequency range tested, indicating that the model may be used at high frequencies when the plane wave mode is dominant."

Gathering of EVA motion patterns is necessary for risk analysis and mitigation. However, many existing techniques, such as motion capture systems, are not only cost-prohibitive but are impractical for retrospective analysis of past missions. In this work, a software tool was developed, which can estimate the 3D poses of a spacesuit from photographs or videos, without using special sensors or equipment. The tool is based on the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) system, which was trained by studying and capturing motion patterns of past and current spacesuit test data. The AI/ML tool was further enhanced using synthetically generated data, in which the suit postures, backgrounds, camera angles and illumination conditions were parametrically adjusted and rendered for training. The tool, incorporated the methodologies of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), was trained, and tested in the cloud computing environment. The trained model was then applied on new imagery and video to extract estimated joint positions and suit outlines. The joint positions were further processed to capture activity (“digging”), pose labels (“bending”), and other useful downstream information. The model performance on new imagery and video was successfully assessed for accuracy and reliability. This AI/ML based posture recognition tool thus allows for the quantification of injury risk and task performance characterization for both current and past missions and training, which can immensely help to improve EVA task and suit design."

Artemis I, the un-crewed exoLEO test flight, was completed in 2022. This paper will summarize the performance of the onboard targeting algorithm, the two-level targeter (TLT), during the flight. The function of the TLT is to autonomously recompute the burn targets for the upcoming burn (or multiple burns) in response to navigation and vehicle dispersions, providing a solution that meets all of the trajectory constraints. Although the TLT has been utilized previously as a ground-based planning tool, the Artemis I mission is the first time it has been flown onboard. The lessons learned from TLT performance during Artemis I will help to inform the further development of the algorithm for future Artemis missions."
510,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230000826,2023-08-03,High-Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN) User Guide Version 1.0,"Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) has been identified as a key technology to enable and facilitate the development and growth of future space networks. Classically, space communications networks are collections of disparate links that are manually managed either point-to-point or use space relays. The accelerating accessibility of space enables a new scaling of space nodes, yet both the manual management of configurations and scheduling and the lack of structure connecting links precisely prohibit scaling. This challenge gives rise to newer and larger classes of communications needs that are met by DTN, which must overcome the disconnection, disruption, latency, and mobility featured in space communications systems.

DTN joins the underlying links as an overlay, and can be made to communicate over any protocol stack. The core actions of DTN are store, carry, and forward, where data are stored instead of dropped if there is no immediately available outduct. It does this by taking the DTN unit of data, bundles, and providing necessary layers to adapt these bundles to the underlying transport protocols of choice; these are called convergence layers. DTN's Bundle Protocol (BP) can then be used on top of terrestrial protocol stacks, such as TCP/IP, as well as protocols for space, such as LTP/AOS, all in the same network. For emphasis it is noted that bundles can be of essentially any size, and hence this convergence to lower layers of choice is necessary.

Existing DTN implementations have operated in constrained environments with limited resources, resulting in low data speeds. However, as various technologies have advanced, data transfer rates and efficiency have advanced, which has pushed the need for a DTN implementation for ground systems and for spacecraft that is performance-oriented in order to not impose an unnecessary bottleneck.

High-rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN) takes advantage of modern hardware platforms to substantially reduce latency and improve throughput compared to today’s DTN operations. The HDTN implementation maintains interoperability with existing deployments of DTN that conform to IETF RFCs 4838, 5050, and 9171. At the same time, HDTN defines a new data format better suited to higher-rate operation. It defines and adopts a massively parallel pipelined and message-oriented architecture, allowing the system to scale gracefully as its resources increase. HDTN’s architecture also supports hooks to replace various processing pipeline elements with specialized hardware accelerators. This offers improved Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) characteristics while reducing development complexity and cost."

Prescriptive maintenance takes this a step further and considers the entire aviation ecosystem to schedule maintenance actions optimally. With the ability to reduce maintenance costs by up to 30%, as reported by the Department of Energy, these maintenance strategies have been identified to be an important investment to reduce a airline costs. However, despite great interest and technological advances in areas such as diagnostics, prognostics, sensing, computation, and machine learning, the adoption of predictive and prescriptive maintenance has not been widely applied in aviation. 
<p style=""text-indent: 25px;"">To shed light on this issue, we conducted an analysis of the barriers preventing or limiting the adoption of predictive and prescriptive maintenance in aviation. Through discussions with subject matter experts across industry, academia, standards bodies, and government, we identified five key challenges: complexity of prediction; validation, safety assurance, and regulatory challenges; cost of adoption; difficulty in quantifying impact and informing decisions; and data availability, quality, and ownership challenges. This study provides a detailed overview of these barriers and areas where stakeholders could invest to overcome them, aiming to support the scaled adoption of predictive and prescriptive maintenance in aviation."

Testing will be performed using EP’s Frost-Mint cryogenic propellant test stand, using an engine updated based on data collected from previous engine testing at Plum Brook Station, to determine conditions under which the cryogenic propellants will consistently and reliably ignite. 

In FY22 the project successfully completed the following milestones. The cryogenic test stand Frost-Mint was upgraded to include an integrated vacuum tube and liquid nitrogen cooling system enabling cold vacuum ignition testing. The Integrated GN2/LN2 Ultra-Low-temperature Enclosure (IGLUE), a custom-built close-coupled heater exchanger shroud was designed, fabricated, tested and integrated into the test stand. The vacuum tube and IGLUE enabled the thruster body and propellants to be conditioned to temperatures and pressures desired. This work recreated the no-light conditions experienced during vehicle-level thermal vacuum testing and obtained thruster performance data and ignition imagery."

Regional governments across Russia have started to design and develop adaptation policies and plans (i.e. outputs) to this end. Our comprehensive understanding on the state of wildfire adaptation in policy is limited. In this article we systematically review policies and plans developed to adapt to wildfires in the Russian Arctic. Using systematic approaches, we identify 12 wildfire adaptation outputs adopted between 2008 and 2020. Our findings indicate that wildfire adaptation outputs are aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and improve wildland fire response, implemented through legislative and regulatory mechanisms, developed at the regional level, adopted in response to national mandates, and mainstreamed into existing forest management policies. Although there is evidence of wildfire adaptation planning occurring in the Russian Arctic, we find that the nature and extent of wildfire adaptation outputs are not sufficient to address the seriousness and severity of climate change, with key shortcomings found in relation to the scientific, human, and management characteristics. We argue that expanding the profile of climate change research in the Russian Arctic and improving the dialogue among researchers, local and Indigenous peoples, and decision-makers are critical for providing useful recommendations for policy makers to accelerate wildfire adaptation in the Russian Arctic."

They are supplemented with available Chandra X-ray data, optical data taken by Hyper Suprime-Cam on Subaru, and millimeter-wave SZE data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Taking into account departures from spherical symmetry, we have reconstructed non-parametrically the inner pressure profile of two clusters as well as electron temperature and density profiles for RCS J2319+0038. This is one of the first such measurements for an individual cluster at z≳0.9⁠. We find that the inner pressure profile of both clusters is much shallower than that of local cool-core clusters. Our results consistently suggest that RCS J2319+0038 hosts a weak cool core, where radiative cooling is less significant than in local cool cores. On the other hand, HSC J0947−0119 exhibits an even shallower pressure profile than RCS J2319+0038 and is more likely to be a non-cool-core cluster. The SZE centroid position is offset by more than 140 h<sup>−1</sup><sub>70</sub> kpc from the peaks of galaxy distribution in HSC J0947−0119, suggesting a stronger influence of mergers in this cluster. We conclude that these distant clusters are at a very early stage of developing the cool cores typically found in clusters at lower redshifts."

For example, untimely activation of pyrotechnics used for a flight termination system could override an abort capability. Over the years, NASA and the military have learned lessons about safe pyrotechnic circuit design and test, many of which are codified. However, with NASA’s recent efforts to move toward a development model than leans more heavily on Commercial Partners these requirements have not always been directly levied on projects and in some cases been misinterpreted.

The updated stratospheric aerosol subtyping algorithm used in the version 4.5 (V4.5) release of the Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) level 2 data products now delivers more comprehensive and accurate classifications than its predecessor. The original algorithm identified four aerosol subtypes for layers detected above the tropopause: volcanic ash, smoke, sulfate/other, and polar stratospheric aerosol (PSA). In the revised algorithm, sulfates are separately identified as a distinct, homogeneous subtype, and the diffuse, weakly scattering layers previously assigned to the sulfate/other class are recategorized as a fifth “unclassified” subtype. By making two structural changes to the algorithm and revising two thresholds, the V4.5 algorithm improves the ability to discriminate between volcanic ash and smoke from pyrocumulonimbus injections, improves the fidelity of the sulfate subtype, and more accurately reflects the uncertainties inherent in the classification process. The 532 nm lidar ratio for volcanic ash was also revised to a value more consistent with the current state of knowledge. This paper briefly reviews the previous version of the algorithm (V4.1 and V4.2) then fully details the rationale and impact of the V4.5 changes on subtype classification frequency for specific events where the dominant aerosol type is known based on the literature. Classification accuracy is best for volcanic ash due to its characteristically high depolarization ratio. Smoke layers in the stratosphere are also classified with reasonable accuracy, though during the daytime a substantial fraction are misclassified as ash. It is also possible for mixtures of ash and sulfate to be misclassified as smoke. The V4.5 sulfate subtype accuracy is less than that for ash or smoke, with sulfates being misclassified as smoke about one-third of the time. However, because exceptionally tenuous layers are now assigned to the unclassified subtype and the revised algorithm levies more stringent criteria for identifying an aerosol as sulfate, it is more likely that layers labeled as this subtype are in fact sulfate compared to those assigned the sulfate/other classification in the previous data release."

This mathematical fact contradicts the accepted unconditional inverse relation between Whitham’s F-function and equivalent area in the sonic boom research literature. Piecewise linear approximations of an F-function and of the second derivative of an equivalent area are used to derive numerical formulas for conversions between Whitham’s F-function and equivalent area. Numerical results are included to show convergence of the numerical conversions as the maximum length of the segments for piecewise linear approximations goes to zero. These numerical conversions are approximately the inverse transforms of each other when the second derivative of an equivalent area is continuous and the slope of the equivalent area at the origin is zero.

524,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230002362,2023-08-03,"Mineralogical, Elemental, and Tomographic Reconnaissance Investigation for CLPS (METRIC)","METRIC is a robotic science laboratory that can determine the mineralogy, elemental chemistry, micromorphology, and thermophysical properties of planetary regolith. The METRIC suite comprises METRIC XRD/F, an X-ray diffraction/X-ray fluorescence instrument that can determine the mineralogy and elemental chemistry of regolith samples; METRIC XCT, a micro X-ray computed tomography instrument that can be used to evaluate grain/crystallite sizes and textures; METRIC IRS, an imaging spectrometer mounted on a rover that can determine mineralogy and thermophysical properties at the landing site; and a pneumatic sample collection, processing, distribution system developed by Honeybee Robotics. The payload elements could be deployed on a static lander or a rover. Data returned from the METRIC payload would inform origin, formation, and evolution of rocky planetary bodies.

METRIC XRD/F draws on heritage from the CheMin instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover [1], with a few important improvements. Like CheMin, METRIC XRD/F operates in transmission geometry and uses piezoelectric actuators on sample cells in a tuning fork geometry to induce convective grain motion of the regolith to create a randomly oriented powder. MSL CheMin uses an energy-sensitive CCD to collect XRD patterns and XRF spectra simultaneously from the same sample cell, resulting in qualitative XRF data. METRIC XRD/F uses two different sample cells, one optimized for XRD and one optimized for XRF, and a silicon drift detector to detect fluoresced X-rays. This improvement to the XRF capabilities provides quantitative geochemical data of major elements down to Z = 11 and allows for the detection of minor and trace elements that are critical for evaluating geologic evolution of the Moon (e.g., P and Th). Modest improvements to the XRD geometry and hardware allow for better angular resolution and the ability to distinguish between members of the pyroxene group.

METRIC XCT uses the same geometry and much of the same hardware as METRIC XRD/F, where a CCD would capture images of a regolith sample in a 3 mm diameter sample tube that is rotated 360° in steps <1°. Image brightness can be used to infer compositional data, where brighter materials indicate a higher Z, much like scanning electron microscopy. Data from METRIC XCT complement those from METRIC XRD/F. Particle size, shape, and texture can provide petrologic and provenance information, whereas vesicle size and morphology in volcanic or impact melt lithologies can inform cooling rates.

METRIC IRS is a hyperspectral thermal imager that can be mounted to a lander or rover to provide mineralogical data from the broader landing site and help determine whether the samples analyzed by METRIC XRD/F and XCT are representative. The METRIC IRS spectral range (8–14 μm) and resolution (10.8 cm-1) allow for quantitative mineralogy from modelling Reststrahlen bands of major rock-forming minerals (e.g., silicates, phosphates). Radiance cubes can be processed and modelled with an onboard high-performance computer to determine mineral abundances of plagioclase, high-Ca pyroxene, pigeonite, orthopyroxene, olivine, and glass.

Regolith samples can be acquired, processed, and delivered to the X-ray instruments via multiple sample handling systems, but the pneumatic sampling systems developed by Honeybee Robotics [e.g., 2] are best suited for relatively low-cost missions that are being competed for the Moon (e.g., NASA’s Payloads and Research Investigations for the Surface of the Moon program). There are pneumatic sampling systems that collect surface material and other systems that pneumatically drill up to ~1 m below the surface, providing material that has not been space weathered and has not been affected by the lander’s exhaust.

The Artemis IV&V organization is actively supporting six distinct development efforts: Orion, the Space Launch System (SLS), Exploration Ground Systems (EGS), Mission Control Center (MCC), the Lunar Gateway, and the Human Landing System (HLS), representing a wide diversity of developer organizations, management structures, and development approaches. With much of this extremely complex flight and ground software being essential to human safety both on the ground and in space, Artemis IV&V is likewise challenged to provide more value-added assurance to future Artemis missions within a constrained budget.

To meet this challenge, Artemis IV&V employs a variety of novel and evolving “Adaptive IV&V” approaches for planning and executing IV&V analysis to increase both the efficiency and effectiveness of the IV&V Program’s assurance activities, and to address the difficulties imposed by assuring software for a large, highly integrated, multi-mission enterprise managed and executed by physically and organizationally distinct programs.

Instilling agile principles like iterative planning cycles, self-organizing teams, and regular retrospectives, into IV&V planning and execution has led to a more rapid turnaround of a minimum viable assurance product and allowed for increased alignment of assurance activities with development progress. Adopting an assurance case methodology has led to greater consistency and clearer communication of assurance design and provided a foundation for long-term maintenance of assurance plans, products, and results across missions. The IV&V-developed Assurance / Safety Case Analytical Network (A-SCAN) framework and tool has enabled the quantification and tracking of system/software risk and confidence. These confidence measures provide a means to repeatedly express the impact of planned and completed assurance work and the remaining residual risk. Applied as part of a “Follow-the-Risk” organizational ethos, this allows consistent rightsizing of analysis rigor and intensity commensurate with the perceived risk of defects, as well as appropriate targeting of the highest risk areas of the software to find safety issues before they can manifest. Finally, the development of the IV&V Advanced Risk Reduction Integrated Software Test and Operations Tri-program Lightweight Environment (ARRISTOTLE), an integrated software-only simulation of Orion, SLS, and EGS systems, has made it possible to independently test integrated pad and flight scenarios and inject faults to observe how the Artemis multi-program, mission software behaves in degraded modes and in response to hazards.

These adaptive IV&V investments have enabled Artemis IV&V to become more efficient and effective in IV&V planning and execution and respond more readily to changes in the risk landscape, increasing the breadth and depth of risk reduction possible within the available resources. Residual risk tracking allows IV&V to communicate more effectively with stakeholders, both internal and external at all levels, and inform key decision-making personnel. This evolving assurance design approach provides IV&V surety that work is performed in the highest risk, most value-added areas of the software, to keep our astronauts and ground crews safe and ensure mission success."

Replacing a physical turbomachinery/rotor with a model driving a subscale electromechanical system capable of emulating subscale torque loads and responses is a lower risk, lower cost alternative to using the full-scale turbomachinery/rotor for initial control system verification. This paper outlines a novel control and scaling approach for emulating dynamic subscale torque loads  using electric machine (EM) hardware for electrified aircraft propulsion research and development purposes. The approach, known as the  Sliding Mode Impedance Controller with Scaling (SMICS), drives a mechanically coupled, two-EM system to behave like a subscale hardware representation of a hybrid-electric turbomachinery shaft. One EM reflects the inertial dynamics and torque load of the subscale turbomachinery under steady-state and transient operation while the second EM represents a motor/generator connected to the shaft, which is intended to hybridize the turbomachinery. This closed loop control and scaling algorithm applies impedance and sliding mode control schemes, along with parameter scaling, to match subscale, desired dynamics in real-time and to allow this system to be driven by a full-scale hybrid-electric turbomachinery model and control. The paper elaborates on the concept of the closed loop control and scaling approach and explains the significance of using impedance and sliding mode control. It shows a derivation of the closed loop control and  scaling algorithm, its implementation, and presents a comparison of theoretical and actual simulation results acquired during hardware-in-the-loop  testing of a partial turboelectric propulsion concept aircraft at the NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed (NEAT).The results show that the intended dynamic responses of the hardware and the aircraft model are achieved in both the time and frequency domain. Full scale  propulsion control systems can be tested using this hardware and software approach."

Most commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) devices are not designed to function under such extreme conditions and very little data exist on their performance outside their specified range of operation.  Extending the temperature range at which electronic parts can operate reliably leads to potential benefits resulting in improving reliability, reducing mass/weight, and simplifying thermal design due to elimination of thermal control elements and fewer parts count.  In this work, the performance of an isolated, precision gate driver for controlling power-level transistors, including gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) devices, was evaluated under extreme temperatures and thermal cycling.  The investigations were carried out to assess performance for potential use of this device in space exploration missions under extreme temperature conditions."

Improving the room temperature damage tolerance capabilities has long been one of the goals in the carbon fiber/polymer composite industry. Recently a new fiber/epoxy system has been introduced that is claimed to have superior damage tolerance capabilities. To examine if this new carbon fiber/epoxy composite material would be of benefit to a program to manufacture a Payload Adapter Fitting (PAF) for NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, the question was asked as to just how much damage tolerance could be realized if this new system were used.

 <p style=""text-indent: 25px;"">Compression after impact (CAI) strength of sandwich structure is one of the leading metrics being used to evaluate materials for the PAF program. As a result, a comparison of this new fiber/resin system with a very common (and planned baseline) fiber/resin system with respect to CAI was considered in this study. While it was already known that the older, baseline carbon fiber structure would not have as good damage tolerance characteristics as the newer carbon fiber system, the quantitative difference in damage tolerance was sought in this study since no other CAI data could be found in open literature on sandwich structures made with this new fiber/resin system."

A mindset more than a prescribed practice, systems thinking provides an understanding of how individuals can work together in different types of teams and through that understanding, create the best possible processes to accomplish just about any-thing.”</i> So, a “Thinking System” is a system that is capable of “systems thinking,” as it should be able to “ …create [utilize] the best possible processes, and possess the [intelligence] to accomplish just about anything.” To achieve this capability, hu-man-like thinking is required. A truly autonomous system must be one that is capable of human-like thinking. Sustained autonomy requires “Thinking Autonomy” (TA) that is enabled by a “Thinking System.”"

A typical Galactic hot core found around a forming massive star is small, dense, hot, and it is rich in complex organic molecules (COMs; six or more atoms including carbon). In this presentation, we report the results of 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line single-pointing observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of the field in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we dubbed N160A–mm. The goal of our study is to investigate the chemical complexity in this region and search for hot cores. The LMC is an ideal location for studying hot core chemistry in an environment distinctly different from the Milky Way due to its lower metallicity and strong UV radiation.

N160A–mm is located in the star-forming region N160 south of 30 Doradus. It hosts two dominant young stellar objects and water (H2O), methanol (CH3OH), and hydroxyl (OH) masers, indicating ongoing star formation. We detect six 1.2 mm continuum sources, five of which are associated with the CH3OH emission peaks and/or extended emission. Methyl cyanide (CH3CN), another COM, is found towards the brightest continuum source in N160A–mm (N160A–mm A), and smaller molecules typically associated with Galactic hot cores (e.g., SO2, SO) are detected in four sources. Using spectral modeling, we estimate the rotational temperatures and column densities of the continuum sources. Based on the derived temperature of above 100 K, we identify N160–mm A as a hot core candidate. Most of the sources in N160A–mm exhibit a complex kinematic structure, providing evidence for large scale motions in the region (e.g., outflows, rotation). We compare the molecular abundances measured for N160-mm A to those found in Galactic hot cores and other LMC hot cores to investigate the impact of the environment on hot core chemistry."

Additionally, the introduction of an electric powertrain to the existing system enables multiple electrified flight modes to exist (i.e. eTaxi, climb boost, takeoff boost, etc.), further increasing the complexity of the modeling environment. As part of the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration program, this paper presents a modeling and simulation framework for a parallel hybrid-electric propulsion concept using the Environmental Design Space simulation tool.

This dissertation presents several system identification research advancements for these modern aircraft configurations enabling accurate mathematical model development for flight dynamics simulations based on wind-tunnel and flight-test data. The first part of the dissertation focuses on advances in flight-test system identification methods using small, fixed-wing, remotely-piloted, electric, propeller-driven aircraft. A generalized approach for flight dynamics model development for small fixed-wing aircraft from flight data is described and is followed by presentation of novel flight-test system identification applications, including: aero-propulsive model development for propeller aircraft and nonlinear dynamic model identification without mass properties. The second part of the dissertation builds on established fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft system identification methods to develop modeling strategies for transitioning, distributed propulsion, eVTOL aircraft. Novel wind-tunnel experiment designs and aero-propulsive modeling approaches are developed using a subscale, tandem tilt-wing, eVTOL aircraft, leveraging design of experiments and response surface methodology techniques. Additionally, a method applying orthogonal phase-optimized multisine input excitations to aircraft control effectors in wind-tunnel testing is developed to improve test efficiency and identified model utility.

However, the direct impact of deep convection on the global lower stratospheric water vapor budget is still an actively debated issue. Two complementary modeling approaches are used to investigate the convective impact in boreal winter and summer. Convective influence is diagnosed by tracing trajectories through convective cloud top altitude fields derived from global rainfall and brightness temperature data. Backward trajectory model simulations coupled with a detailed treatment of cloud microphysical processes indicate that convection moistens the global lower stratosphere by approximately 0.3 ppmv in boreal winter and summer 2010. The diurnal peak in convection is responsible for about half of the total convective moistening during winter and nearly all of the convective moistening during summer. Deep convective clouds overshooting the tropopause have relatively minor effect on global lower stratospheric water vapor. A forward trajectory model coupled with a simplified cloud module is used to estimate the relative magnitude of the interannual variability of the convective impact. Combining the results from the two models, we find that the convective impact on the global lower stratospheric water vapor during 2006-2016 is approximately 0.3 ppmv with year-to-year variations of up to 0.1 ppmv. An important mechanism of convective hydration of the lower stratosphere is via the detrainment of saturated air and ice into the tropical uppermost troposphere and the subsequent upward transport of some of these moist air parcels across relatively warm and subsaturated tropopause."

Prolonged space radiation exposure embrittles materials and structures and abrasive jagged dust particles aggressively wear and erode moving parts leading to premature failure. To counter or even alleviate such potential failures, robust and exceptional materials are needed to make NASA missions including Artemis program sustainable with minimum service and repair needs. This study reports that boron-containing inclusion, B<sub>4</sub>C, can improve wear resistance and radiation shielding/resistance of aluminum alloy (Al6061) significantly to extend the service life in extreme space environments. With increasing B<sub>4</sub>C inclusions, the tensile strength increased up to 20 vol% at both room temperature and an elevated temperature (200˚C) while thermal conductivity decreased gradually as a function of B<sub>4</sub>C concentration. The neutron shielding effectiveness increased more than 110 times when 50 vol% B<sub>4</sub>C is incorporated in Al6061 when compared with the pristine Al6061. The shielding effectiveness under galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE) was also studied computationally using on-line tool for the assessment of radiation in space (OLTARIS). By adding B<sub>4</sub>C, the adverse effect caused by secondary radiation through the Al6061 matrix was effectively suppressed to improve the shielding effectiveness against GCR and SPE. The presence of boron in B<sub>4</sub>C was the main reason for the enhanced radiation shielding capability against neutron, GCR, and SPE environments."

Computer models can be used to predict the filtering effects that the fuselage structure and interior volume have on the exterior sound field in order to simulate the resulting cabin interior noise. However, this can become expensive when a wide frequency range of analysis suitable for passenger auralization is desired. This is particularly the case when using deterministic modeling methods such as finite element analysis (FEA) wherein prohibitively high levels of detail and finite element discretizations are required to resolve the wavelengths at high frequencies. On the contrary, Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA), while not capturing important modal behaviors at low frequencies, is better suited for higher frequency analyses where structural and interior dynamics exhibit high modal overlap and spatially averaged physical quantities suffice. For this reason, a hybrid procedure is considered here that utilizes FE modal solutions at lower frequencies and SEA results at higher frequencies. A transfer function dataset containing the exterior to interior vibroacoustic filtering effect is calculated accordingly and subsequently stored to be used for a variety of exterior dynamic load cases. At low frequencies, the transfer function dataset detail is related to the level of FE model refinement whereas at high frequencies it functions as an equalizer array with a level of detail corresponding to the SEA subsystem partitioning scheme. The above procedure is described herein and demonstrated on a six passenger flight vehicle with eight propulsors in a hover flight condition."

In order to perform a linear technology progression and fairly assess the impacts of powertrain electrification, it is important to first establish parametric state-of-the-art baseline vehicle models with advanced technologies matured by 2030. For a regional turboprop (50-passenger) size class and a thin haul (19-passenger) turboprop size class, a current state-of-the-art technology reference aircraft (TRA) is identified and modeled using a multi-disciplinary analysis and optimization environment. Viable technologies for airframe and conventional propulsion system are then identified which are expected to be available by 2030. These technologies are parametrically infused in the TRA models to create advanced technology aircraft models, which will serve as the baseline models for future studies of powertrain electrification."

Shortly after the eruption, the water vapor anomaly moved northward toward and across the equator. This northward movement appears to be due to equatorial Rossby waves forced by the excessive infrared water vapor cooling. Following the early eruption stage, persistent mid-stratospheric water vapor and aerosol layers were mostly confined to Southern Hemisphere tropics (Eq. to 30°S). However, during the spring of 2022, the westerly phase of the tropical quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) descended through the tropics. The HT water vapor and aerosol anomalies were observed to again move across the equator coincident with the shift in the Brewer-Dobson circulation and the descent of the QBO shear zone."

For additively manufactured metal parts, processing parameters such as laser power and scanning speed are critical to ensure the desired microstructure. For this study, the laser powder bed fusion process parameters were changed at various angular sections on a 21 mm diameter and 3.0 mm thick disk. The measurement of thermal diffusivity was performed by fitting a 1-dimensional thermal model to the data pixel by pixel to produce an inspection image. The image revealed the detection of defects such as lack of fusion porosity and areas of aggregated porosity. The thermal diffusivity imagery was compared to immersion scan ultrasonic and X-ray computed tomography (CT) measurements for validation. Based on these results, additional samples were investigated using a single side thermal inspection technique to detect lack of fusion porosity and near surface voids."

The GAPE database contains astronaut photography spanning all manned NASA spaceflight missions over the past 60 years and continuing to this day with operations on the International Space Station (ISS). The continuous crew presence in low Earth orbit (LEO) on the ISS for the last 22+ years and the advent of digital handheld cameras has resulted in an exponential increase in astronaut photography, growing the GAPE collection to over 4.5M photographs (Figs. 1 and 2). This increase in astronaut photography of Earth has corresponded to a significant increase in interest in the collection by the research community and the public. The Earth Science and Remote Sensing (ESRS) group at Johnson Space Center, which manages Crew Earth Observations (CEO) from the ISS, has been developing multiple new tools to improve the GAPE database so that users can more quickly find the imagery they need. The three major enhancements to GAPE are: a new API to interface with the database, a method for automatically georeferencing ISS photos (Fig. 3), and a new tool for automatically generating timelapse movies."

We demonstrate the value of mining the VIIRS DNB for aurora and describe our use of unsupervised machine learning to create a binary mask for aurora occurrence. This mask can be used to flag aurora-contaminated observations for NASA's nighttime lights products for Earth science applications. The identification of auroral regions can also be used for Space Weather applications, for example, for comparison with aurora forecast model and with other satellite- or ground-based aurora observations. The DNB is a broadband channel that is sensitive to wavelengths from 500 to 900 nm, which covers most of the visible light spectrum, and as the name implies, captures light even at night with a sensitivity at the nanowatt level. This band is suitable for aurora observations since the light emitted by the aurora tends to be dominated by emissions from atomic oxygen, resulting in a greenish glow at a wavelength of 557.7 nm, especially at an altitude of 110 km. This study compares the global nighttime derived aurora regions for 17 and 18 March with the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center's (SWPC) probability product for the St. Patrick's Day geomagnetic storm in 2015. VIIRS sensors are slated to be added to the next generation of polar-orbiting operational satellites.

This approach forms a more comprehensive approach to system safety thinking. A need exists for methods to enable a better understanding of human contributions to aviation safety and how they may inform Safety Management Systems (SMS). A high-fidelity 737-800 simulation study was conducted to study how current type-rated commercial airline flight crews anticipate, monitor, respond to, and learn from expected and unexpected disturbances during line operations. A number of dependent measures were collected that included traditional SMS data types, but also non-traditional safety data to include multiple psychophysiological metrics.

The literature is consistent but mostly theoretical: stakeholder participation should positively influence and increase the probability of implementation (see e.g., Christie, 2011; Cousins and Earl, 1992); Fetterman, 2004). In response, I use two Goddard Space Flight Center engineering technical training and development programs to build a causal pathway argument supporting my proposition that stakeholder influence in the logic modeling process impacts organizational decision-making and change. I first introduce the logic modeling process as a tool to involve stakeholders in program and evaluation design (paper 1), then use the data collection process to implement the collaboratively constructed logic model outcomes (paper 2), and finally, I triangulate the data using the Toal (2009) Evaluation Involvement Scale (paper 3). I do this to “increase the validity of the findings” (Noble & Heale, 2019, p. 67) and to garner potential mechanisms. I found that stakeholder participation in the logic modeling process positively influenced the use of data to inform recommendations which in turn positively influenced implementation of evaluation recommendations. I identified the process itself as the mechanism and the key decision points as links or influencers. Potential factors included power and interest (measured by role) and time-on-job."

The present work is an effort to expand the application of SMARP and SHARP summary heliomagnetic parameters to the forecasting of solar flares. A new data product was derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP and SHARP summary parameter data series, which were further converted into two-dimensional arrays by selecting time slices corresponding to R-value maxima, where R-value is a measure of the unsigned magnetic flux near polarity inversion lines. The resulting combined MDI-HMI time series currently span the period between April 4, 1996 and December 13, 2022, and can be extended to a more recent date, providing an opportunity to correlate and compare them with other solar activity parameters, such as the daily solar flare index, which is computed as a sum of the product of GOES X-ray flare magnitude and flare duration, for all M- and X-class flares during a day. Preliminary results demonstrate a significant overall correlation, with Pearson coefficients between 0.339 and 0.627. In addition, an oscillating pattern is seen in the daily-averaged sliding-window correlation coefficient. Time-lagged cross-correlation indicates that a leader-follower dynamic exists in some parameters, especially R-value, where they lead the flare index by at least several days, which may have potential for further application in space weather forecasting."

Committees of neural networks identical in input features have been used to solve this problem by (Aminalragia et al., 2021), but they have the possibility of all agreeing together in lockstep and missing crucial information.

A Deep Dive of the NASA GLOBE Clouds Data Set With Satellite Comparisons,"The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) citizen science program has recently conducted a series of month-long intensive observation periods (IOPs), asking the public to  submit daily reports on cloud and sky conditions from all regions of Earth. This provides a wealth of crowdsourced observations from the ground, which complements other conventional scientific cloud data. In addition, the GLOBE reports are matched in space and time with geostationary and low Earth orbit satellites, which allows for a straightforward comparison of cloud properties, and minimizes the biases associated with mismatched sampling between participants and satellites.

The matched GLOBE dataset is used to calculate the mean observed cloud cover by atmospheric level both worldwide and by region. The overall magnitudes of cloud cover between the GLOBE participants and the matched satellites agree within 10%, which is notable given the distinctly different natures of the data sources. The mean vertical cloud profiles show GLOBE reporting more low-level clouds and fewer high-level clouds than satellites. The low cloud disagreement is likely related to satellites missing low clouds when high clouds block their view. Conversely, the high cloud disagreement is related primarily to cloud opacity, as satellites may miss some optically thin clouds. Monte Carlo testing shows the results to be robust, and the tripled amount of IOP data reduces uncertainty by half. These findings also highlight ways in which citizen science IOP data may be used to support scientific research while accounting for their unique properties.

Plain Language Summary: 
Citizen science is becoming an increasingly prominent aspect of scientific research, and so it important to study how citizen science data can be used effectively. For example, The GLOBE Program has recently conducted a series of special data-collecting events, or “challenges”, which gathered large numbers of reports on cloud and sky conditions. Because NASA GLOBE Clouds matches the participant reports with cloud observations from satellites, we can use these data to get a combined view of clouds from above and below. When looking at the average cloud cover for different atmospheric levels across Earth, we find that the GLOBE participants and the satellites agree quite closely. This is a surprising and fascinating find, given how different in nature volunteer ground reports are to satellite measurements. However, there are some small but notable disagreements between GLOBE participants and satellites about the distribution of cloud cover at different levels. In addition, by testing the data for uncertainty, we show that the results from the GLOBE data are reliable, and that more public participation improves the reliability. So, by carefully designing the analysis methodology, and by testing for the uncertainty of the data, citizen science can make a meaningful contribution to scientific research."

The most significant result was that through-thickness variations in microtextural characteristics were asymmetrical about the mid-plane of the plate.  However, the overall texture intensity was low, such that cross-sectional variations were classified as a second order effect on ST ductility."

A large part of enabling MW EAP is developing specific-power-dense electric machines. As specific-power-dense electric machines are scaled up from kW to MW power levels, the thermal stresses on the machines increase in both magnitude and performance-affecting characteristics. This is particularly true for the stators of these machines. Analysis via thermal resistance network modeling and multiscale modeling reveals that increasing amounts of heat will be trapped in the stator windings as the power levels increase. The challenges this presents can be addressed through material advancements whereby materials gain multifunctionality. Specifically, the electrical insulation and potting materials, along with the electrical conductor, that compose the stator slot must work together (gain multifunctionality) to relieve the increased thermal stress. Materials research at the NASA Glenn Research Center points to some useful solutions in this trade space."

Among these species, the Common Loon (Gavia immer), occupies the land-water interface on lakefront habitats in New Hampshire (NH) which exposes nest sites to human encroachment. In collaboration with the Loon Preservation Committee (LPC), we utilized NASA Earth observations to predict future conflicts between loon habitats and human development in New Hampshire. Land use & land cover (LULC), water clarity, and land surface temperature (LST) were analyzed to determine habitat suitability for loons. We used land cover classifications from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to analyze development around eight NH lakes (Canobie, First Connecticut, Massabesic, Newfound, Onway, Squam, Umbagog, and Winnipesaukee) from 2001 to 2019. Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data provided land surface temperature between 2000 and 2022. Additionally, we utilized Landsat 8 OLI imagery to estimate water clarity between 2013 and 2022. LULC analysis identified areas of development around each lake for 2001, 2019, and land available for future development as of 2019. Assessment of mean summer land surface temperature revealed that loons' presence persists, despite increasing temperatures. We observed increased average water clarity in lakes that were more developed, in general the southernmost lakes analyzed within NH. We synthesized these results to assist the LPC in future conservation efforts."

In an NTP system, the energy released from fission in the core is utilized as the heat source to directly heat a propellant for propulsion, rather than chemical combustion in a traditional rocket. NTP has many desirable capabilities including flexible mission launch dates and reduced transit times due to it’s capability for high specific impulse. One of the main challenges with NTP systems is the structural integrity of the fuel. The fuel form required in the reactor core must withstand temperatures above 2700 Kelvin. Ceramic-metallic matrix fuel, ceramic-ceramic matrix fuel, and solid solution carbide fuels are the three strongest candidates for the extreme environments. Solid solution carbides have the potential to exhibit promising behavior as a fuel form in an NTP system. Of the multiple refractory metal carbides of interest, here we focus on zirconium carbide (ZrC), niobium carbide (NbC), and tantalum carbide (TaC). ZrC, NbC, and TaC powders were consolidated in monocarbide (ZrC, NbC, and TaC) and bi-carbide (ZrC-NbC, ZrC-TaC, NbC-TaC) forms using spark plasma sintering (SPS). In addition to the pure endpoint carbides, the examined compositions of the various bi-carbides ranged from 25-75 mol%. The sintering temperatures, pressures, and hold times were varied to determine the ideal sintering conditions. Grain size analysis, Archimedes’ density, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) were used to determine and characterize the grain size, ideal density, porosity, phase stability, and chemical composition of each sample. The data from each sample was then used to generate a Master Sintering Curve (MSC) unique to each monocarbide or bi-carbide."

The abundances and relative distributions of both classes of molecules were determined, as well as the enantiomeric compositions of the chiral amino acids. The Ryugu samples studied here were recovered from sample chambers A and C, which were composed of surface material, and a combination of surface and possible subsurface material, respectively. A total of thirteen amino acids were detected and quantitated in these samples, with an additional five amino acids that were tentatively identified but not quantitated. The abundances of four aliphatic amines identified in the Ryugu samples were also determined in the current work. Amino acids were observed in the acid hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed hot water extracts of asteroid Ryugu regolith using liquid chromatography with UV fluorescence detection and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Conversely, aliphatic amines were only analyzed in the unhydrolyzed hot water Ryugu extracts. Two- to six-carbon (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>) amino acids with individual abundances ranging from 0.02 to 15.8 nmol g<sup>−1</sup>, and one- to three-carbon (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) aliphatic amines with individual abundances from 0.05 to 34.14 nmol g<sup>−1</sup>, were found in the hot water extracts. Several non-protein amino acids that are rare in biology, including β-amino-n-butyric acid (β-ABA) and β-aminoisobuytric acid (β-AIB), were racemic or very nearly racemic, thus indicating their likely abiotic origins. Trace amounts of select protein amino acids that were enriched in the ւ-enantiomer may indicate low levels of terrestrial amino acid contamination in the samples. However, the presence of elevated abundances of free and racemic alanine, a common protein amino acid in terrestrial biology, and elevated abundances of the predominately free and racemic non-protein amino acids, β-ABA and β-AIB, indicate that many of the amino acids detected in the Ryugu water extracts were indigenous to the samples. Although the Ryugu samples have been found to be chemically similar to CI type carbonaceous chondrites, the measured concentrations and relative distributions of amino acids and aliphatic amines in Ryugu samples were notably different from those previously observed for the CI1.1 carbonaceous chondrite, Orgueil. This discrepancy could be the result of differences in the original chemical compositions of the parent bodies and/or alteration conditions, such as space weathering. In addition to α-amino acids that could have been formed by Strecker cyanohydrin synthesis during a low temperature aqueous alteration phase, β-, γ-, and δ-amino acids, including C<sub>3</sub> – C<sub>5</sub> straight-chain n-ω-amino acids that are not formed by Strecker synthesis, were also observed in the Ryugu extracts. The suite of amino acids measured in the Ryugu samples indicates that multiple amino acid formation mechanisms were active on the Ryugu parent body. The analytical techniques used here are well-suited to search for similar analytes in asteroid Bennu material collected by the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission scheduled for Earth return in September 2023."

The NASA HR-1 for AM applications was specifically formulated for high ductility in high pressure gaseous hydrogen environment in addition to high strength and low cycle fatigue (LCF) resistance. NASA HR-1 meets materials requirements for liquid rocket engine components, including good hydrogen resistance, high conductivity, good LCF performance, and high elongation and strength for components in medium heat flux environments. NASA has completed fabrication of several subscale and full-scale channel wall nozzles in LP-DED NASA HR-1 and completed hot-fire testing.  This includes refinement of the process to produce thin-walls and various channel geometries to meet the requirements for channel wall nozzle applications.  The main objective of this investigation is to better understand the effects of tensile test strain rate and specimen surface finish on the amount of tensile ductility degradation in high pressure gaseous hydrogen environments. Performing smooth tensile tests in high pressure hydrogen and nitrogen environments can serve as a rapid and economical screening method to determine the relative susceptibility of materials to HEE.  This paper presents the tensile test results for LP-DED NASA HR-1 in hydrogen and details the material evaluation on the effects of strain rate and surface finish condition on surface cracking behavior and fracture characteristics. The resistance to HEE for LP-DED NASA HR-1 and the wrought alloy is compared under the same testing conditions. Loss of tensile ductility is quantified in terms of changes in elongation at failure in hydrogen to compare HEE susceptibility. The most suitable strain rate and specimen surface finish condition for future HEE screening testing at MSFC are recommended."

For exploration missions, returned water samples will not be an option, so spacecraft and habitats will need to be equipped with advanced water monitoring capabilities. Eventually, missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond should be equipped with analytical capabilities roughly analogous to those found in terrestrial labs. Based on what we know about current and future spacecraft environments, SWIM will seek to provide enhanced analytical capability that enables NASA to confidently send astronauts on distant missions without the possibility of returned water samples.

The SWIM architecture can be broken down in an Organic Water Module (OWM) and an Inorganic Water Module (IWM), independent of each other but can be flown together if desired; an integrated system may share some commonality, e.g., single sample injection, sampling consumables, waste, etc. Each of these main modules can be broken down further into separation (if required) and detection modules. And, each separation module can be paired with one or more detection module depending on mission, spacecraft, customer needs, and size/mass/power constraints.

This paper discusses the research and development progress toward the goal of a total water analysis system. For OWM, one of the analysis technologies that the SWIM team have been developing is a liquid-injection gas chromatograph mass spectrometer system; these systems are the workhorses of analytical chemistry laboratories world-wide. For IWM, the team is exploring a number of technologies ranging from traditional liquid chromatography technologies (e.g. ion chromatography, capillary electrophoresis) to flight-heritage technology such as ion-specific electrodes."

In a previous study, a set of sweating hotplate experiments was specifically created to obtain test data for model validation. The clothing moisture model was subsequently coupled with a human thermal model and tested by simulating human experiments described in the open literature, which served to verify the model’s ability to predict whole body thermo-physiologic state in work-rest cycles during which sweating was known to occur. In this study, a human subject test was specifically designed to validate the model’s ability to predict local and whole body sweat evaporation and accumulation on the surface of the body. The human subject test incorporated twelve clothed male subjects of moderate physical fitness, ages 18-30, which were prescribed a work-rest cycle in a climate-controlled chamber (25 °C, 50% RH). Two activity levels were considered during the active stage (4 MET vs. 6.5 MET), and two sets of ending ambient conditions were considered for the final rest stage (25 °C vs. 15 °C, 50% RH). Model predictions were compared to the measured local skin temperatures, core temperatures, and whole body sweat losses. In general, the model was able to reproduce the trends observed in the human subject trial, but more importantly, provided insight into how dynamic changes in liquid content can impact the evolution of local and whole body thermo-physiologic state. This study demonstrates the ability of an advanced moisture model to capture distinct physics attributable to moisture accumulation, allowing for increased accuracy in predicting human thermal state and for interpreting the results of measurements derived from human subject tests."

This paper details the testing of the TS at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) including the vibration (vibe) test, pre-vibe thermal vacuum (t-vac) cycle test, post-vibe t-vac cycle test, and long duration t-vac cycle test. The data collected from the pre- and post-vibe tests are compared to show the impact of the vibe test on performance. The data collected from the long duration test is used to calculate the total thermal contact conductance through the TS interfaces for both ‘on’ (TS closed, during hot plateau) and ‘off’ (TS open, during cold plateau) configurations, and the turndown ratio is also calculated. Challenges experienced throughout testing are also discussed."

Studies to estimate surface properties from hyperspectral data use a range of algorithms sensitive to various sources of spectroscopic uncertainty, which are in turn influenced by mission architecture choices. Retrieval algorithms vary across scientific fields and may be more or less sensitive to mission architecture choices that affect spectral, spatial, or temporal resolutions and spectrometer SNR. We used representative remote sensing algorithms across terrestrial and aquatic study domains to inform aspects of mission design that are most important for impacting accuracy in each scientific area. We simulated the propagation of uncertainties in the retrieval process including the effects of different instrument configuration choices. We found that retrieval accuracy and information content degrade consistently at >10 nm spectral resolution, >30 m spatial resolution, and >8-day revisit. In these studies, the noise reduction associated with lower spatial resolution improved accuracy vis à vis high spatial resolution measurements. The interplay between spatial resolution, temporal revisit, and SNR can be quantitatively assessed for imaging spectroscopy missions and used to identify key components of algorithm performance and mission observing criteria."

A key component that can enable this type of operation is a high-power amplifier (HPA) that resides on the radio platform. In this report, we present the RF performance characteristics of a Ka-band gallium nitride (GaN) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) based HPA for cognitive radio platforms. These characteristics include the output power, gain, power added efficiency (PAE), RMS error vector magnitude (EVM), spectral efficiency, 3rdorder intermodulation distortion (IMD) products, spectrum, spectral regrowth, noise figure (NF), phase noise, and group delay. The data presented indicates that the HPA meets NTIA, military, and commercial spectral mask requirements. In addition, we discuss the benefits offered by the above performance characteristics toward the design and implementation of a cognitive radio platform. Furthermore, as examples, we discuss three potential use cases that apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques and exploit the performance characteristics discussed above to provide a knowledge-based cognitive radio platform design for SATCOM. Thus, cognitive radios with performance flexibility can enable roaming and provide seamless interoperability autonomously in the future between NASA, commercial, and other space networks owned by U.S. government agencies."

A baseline architecture for a cooled high-pressure turbine (HPT) CMC blade and accompanying sub-component test articles were developed with the intent to demonstrate through analysis and subcomponent testing how material and design parameters impact key failure modes. 

As part of this program, a notional architecture for a cooled CMC blade was matured through a design review rhythm to produce a blade test article containing the necessary features required for operation in an engine like environment. Further validation of the durability of these features were achieved through coupon and sub-component testing to demonstrate the durability of cooling hole configurations and blade attachment designs.

2.	Forecasting capabilities, providing an integrated picture of how Earth systems will evolve in the future from the current state
3.	Impact Assessment capabilities, providing an integrated picture of how Earth systems could evolve under different hypothetical what-if scenarios.
Developing such a vision will require technologies related to: integrating continuous observations from various disparate sources; developing frameworks that builds on inter-connected models; improving the speed and accuracy of integrated prediction, analysis and visualization capabilities (e.g., by using machine learning); and utilizing causality and uncertainty quantification to improve our understanding of the evolution of Earth Science systems as a function of their interactions with other Earth and human systems.

Following the end of the nozzle a plume is created containing combustion gases and high velocity droplets of unburnt propellant that with time can erode the surfaces it strikes. A simulation that can accurately model a thruster’s plume can help us reduce the erosion of components struck by the plume. The creation of this simulation can be broken into several parts, and this paper focuses on finding out what distribution of particles along a plane in the nozzle, where combustion can be assumed to be complete, creates the observed particle distribution in the plume. Findings show that unburnt droplets are mostly concentrated in the center of the nozzle or uniformly dispersed within the nozzle."

The transfer of cryogenic propellants is of particular interest because it has never been successfully demonstrated in microgravity. Several ground tests have been conducted in past decades examining various tank chilldown and fill methods. Creating accurate models using these historical datasets is a vital step toward developing appropriate modeling tools to form pre-test predictions for eventual flight and ground tests of various novel injector concepts. The goal of this work was to create a working model in Thermal Desktop using data from the CRYOTE-2 experiments whose purpose was to demonstrate the chill and fill process in a spherical receiver tank parametrically examining the effect of injection method, receiver tank initial wall temperature and initial state, supply pressure, and mass flow rate on the NVF process. These tests were conducting using liquid nitrogen with different injectors with different injection patterns. The focus of the current work is on one particular spray nozzle. The pressure rise inside the tank, the fill level, and the change in the outside wall temperature were all tracked and compared with test data.

The extensible traffic management (xTM) concept assumes that the new vehicles can operate in a dedicated Cooperative Area (CA) with minimal interaction with conventional air traffic and requiring minimal air traffic supervision. Our method assumes that a new xTM CA can be created when an underutilized airspace with little or no traffic can be identified. Our approach involves modeling airspace as a tree data structure and iteratively subdividing it into smaller cells, with underutilized airspace defined as any cells without flight tracks. The benefits of our approach include its applicability to all xTM scenarios, the ability to handle both 2D and 3D space using a unique tree data structure, and computational efficiency for key functions such as space decomposition, labeling of connected cells, and searching of cells containing a given point. By automatically searching for underutilized airspace based on operating air traffic patterns, we can optimize airspace utilization and improve air traffic management.

Several of these calculations [1–3] have been done by the Kasting group. We refer to the current version of that model as the‘standard’1-D model (see §2). Recently, Cooke et al., henceforth C22 ,performed a similar calculation using a three-dimensional (3-D) coupled chemistry-climate model (WACCM6). They found substantially lower ozone column depths at lower pO2levels. For example, at0.01 times the present atmospheric level (PAL) of O(2), Segura et  al. calculated 124 Dobson units(DU), whereas C22 calculated a mean column depth of just 66 DU—almost a factor of two lower. This comparison is shown in figure 1. C22 argued, correctly, that 3-D models should be able to do a better job on this problem than 1-D models because ozone column depths are affected by atmospheric transport, e.g. the Brewer–Dobson circulation in the stratosphere that blows ozone from the tropics towards the poles, as well as vertical transport that carries ozone downward from the stratosphere to the troposphere. Meridional transport is absent in 1-D models, and vertical transport is fixed, so model geometry almost certainly contributes to the observed discrepancies in ozone column depth. The 3-D model also has a variable tropopause height (higher at the equator, lower towards the poles), which is difficult to simulate in one dimension."

The NASA Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) Program contributes to NASA’s human spaceflight goals by providing IV&V services for NASA’s critical spacecraft and ground software. The IV&V Program is tasked with providing assurance from both individual and integrated mission software perspectives. The Artemis IV&V organization is actively supporting six distinct development efforts: Orion, the Space Launch System (SLS), Exploration Ground Systems (EGS), Mission Control Center (MCC), the Lunar Gateway, and the Human Landing System (HLS), representing a wide diversity of developer organizations, management structures, and development approaches. With much of this extremely complex flight and ground software being essential to human safety both on the ground and in space, Artemis IV&V is likewise challenged to provide more value-added assurance to future Artemis missions within a constrained budget.

To meet this challenge, Artemis IV&V employs a variety of novel and evolving “Adaptive IV&V” approaches for planning and executing IV&V analysis to increase both the efficiency and effectiveness of the IV&V Program’s assurance activities, and to address the difficulties imposed by assuring software for a large, highly integrated, multi-mission enterprise managed and executed by physically and organizationally distinct programs.

Instilling agile principles like iterative planning cycles, self-organizing teams, and regular retrospectives, into IV&V planning and execution has led to a more rapid turnaround of a minimum viable assurance product and allowed for increased alignment of assurance activities with development progress. Adopting an assurance case methodology has led to greater consistency and clearer communication of assurance design and provided a foundation for long-term maintenance of assurance plans, products, and results across missions. The IV&V-developed Assurance / Safety Case Analytical Network (A-SCAN) framework and tool has enabled the quantification and tracking of system/software risk and confidence. These confidence measures provide a means to repeatedly express the impact of planned and completed assurance work and the remaining residual risk. Applied as part of a “Follow-the-Risk” organizational ethos, this allows consistent rightsizing of analysis rigor and intensity commensurate with the perceived risk of defects, as well as appropriate targeting of the highest risk areas of the software to find safety issues before they can manifest. Finally, the development of the IV&V Advanced Risk Reduction Integrated Software Test and Operations Tri-program Lightweight Environment (ARRISTOTLE), an integrated software-only simulation of Orion, SLS, and EGS systems, has made it possible to independently test integrated pad and flight scenarios and inject faults to observe how the Artemis multi-program, mission software behaves in degraded modes and in response to hazards.

These adaptive IV&V investments have enabled Artemis IV&V to become more efficient and effective in IV&V planning and execution and respond more readily to changes in the risk landscape, increasing the breadth and depth of risk reduction possible within the available resources. Residual risk tracking allows IV&V to communicate more effectively with stakeholders, both internal and external at all levels, and inform key decision-making personnel. This evolving assurance design approach provides IV&V surety that work is performed in the highest risk, most value-added areas of the software, to keep our astronauts and ground crews safe and ensure mission success."

Currently, there are a relatively small number of crops that can be reliably grown for space crop production efforts. Recent challenges with Veggie plant growth technical demonstrations, such as interveinal chlorosis and necrosis of Tokyo Bekana Chinese cabbage when grown under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (~3000 ppm) and narrow-band LED lighting, have highlighted the necessity to conduct rigorous ISS-relevant crop screening on the ground. Additionally, crops should be selected to address specific nutritional deficits, as identified by NASA’s Human Research Program, with an emphasis on having a diversity of crops to meet nutritional requirements and crew acceptability. To achieve this, the concept of Crop Readiness Level (CRL) has been developed to gauge readiness of crops for spaceflight applications. CRL determination includes assessing environmental compatibility, food safety considerations, relevant nutritional analysis, and sensory analysis. Recent testing at Kennedy Space Center has focused on advancing the CRL of a variety of legumes. Twenty-four varieties of peas (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) and beans (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) were grown under 300 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> PPFD from LED lights, 3000 ppm CO2, and 23 °C to simulate an ISS environment. Crops were harvested and size and yield were assessed. Then, baseline nutritional analysis (Vitamins B1, C, K; elemental analysis; proximate analysis) and sensory evaluation were performed on eight down-selected varieties. These baseline tests will help in selecting candidate crops for future missions and assessing crop production hardware and changes in environmental conditions on future crop performance and nutritional quality."

This paper examines high-fidelity blade-resolved OVERFLOW simulations and medium-fidelity vortex particle–mesh simulations that capture the aerodynamics of a rotorcraft in full and partial ground effect. Results obtained with each CFD method are compared to verify the consistency of the models introduced in the latter, which include an immersed lifting line for the blade aerodynamics and various boundary conditions to account for solid surfaces such as ground and walls. Satisfactory agreement is obtained for the blade loads and rotorwash velocity profiles in the case of a single rotor, except for small discrepancies at the blade tip. Finally, a quadrotor air taxi is simulated to quantify the load imbalance when the vehicle hovers above a rooftop edge. The combined use of high- and medium-fidelity methods is envisioned to accelerate the workflow when a large number of configurations need to be tested."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a non-pharmaceutical tool using galvanic vestibular reduction (GVR) could suppress disorienting illusions and mitigate motion sickness. A similar approach using anodal (inhibitory) currents delivered to both ears has been shown to result in a selective reversible ablation of irregular vestibular afferents [1].
METHODS: Using a repeated measures counter-balanced design, motion sickness and perception were obtained in 26 subjects during Coriolis cross-coupling stimuli on a rotating chair across three GVR treatment interventions: throughout stimulus testing (prevention), following symptom onset (rescue), and placebo control. The GVR peak current was maintained at 2.5 mA across subjects and across prevention / rescue sessions. Subjects performed up to 10 sets of pitch head movements during constant rotation. For each set, head movement was cued every 10 seconds, alternating between pitch forward (chin resting to chest) and pitch backward (head upright) for a total of 7 forward and backward movements. During each head movement, subjects were asked to use a joystick to record the magnitude of their perceived rotation along three axes. During the 2-minute pause between sets, motion sickness symptom scoring was obtained using the Pensacola Diagnostic Index and subject discomfort (0-20) ratings. Performance on a sensorimotor and cognitive test battery was measured during a fourth session to map changes in GVR level with functional performance.
RESULTS: Fourteen of the 26 subjects were not susceptible to the motion stressor (i.e., did not reach an endpoint in the control condition). While the time to endpoint, or number of head movements, did not significantly vary across the three GVR conditions in the remaining subjects, the symptom levels were significantly lower through the third set of head movements when GVR was on throughout the testing. Initiating GVR following symptom onset did not appear to alter the symptom progression nor time to motion sickness endpoint. Based on the joystick measures, GVR significantly modified the perceived roll and pitch sensation during head movements, reducing the amplitude of tilt in most subjects. It is important to note that comparable levels of GVR did not impair performance on a functional test battery including mobility, balance and cognitive tasks.
DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest GVR may be useful in reducing disorienting roll and pitch illusions and delaying the onset of motion sickness. Further enhancements will be required to individualize the stimulation amplitude and optimize the waveform delivery. Adapting this non-pharmaceutical countermeasure approach to allow self-administered titration of current amplitude during recovery would enable transfer to post-flight treatment of motion sickness.

Microgravity causes incredible changes to the human body that increase risk of injury upon return to Earth and lunar/planetary egress scenarios. This is due to deconditioning of the cardiovascular and skeletal muscle systems that reduce aerobic capacity and muscular strength. With upcoming exploration class missions, such as NASA’s Artemis lunar exploration program which aims to send the first female astronaut to the lunar surface by 2030, as well as a long-term goal of Martian exploration, maintaining astronaut health during extended-duration space flight is critical for achieving mission objectives. However, our understanding of these physiological implications due to microgravity are based primarily on flight studies of male astronauts and 1g bed rest analog study participants, with few investigations focusing specifically on females. Innate physiologic differences in endocrine signaling and reproductive function impact sex-dependent responses to various health conditions, treatments, and environmental factors in nearly every system in the body. Therefore, to assume comparable alterations in females in response to microgravity exposure may be inappropriate and consequentially, could lead to lasting impacts on female astronaut health and impact mission success. Moreover, differences in sex hormones may also influence the regulation of cardiovascular control during egress activity after space flight-induced deconditioning and blood volume loss (i.e., risk for orthostatic intolerance). Other potential physiological systems and factors related to musculoskeletal health and aerobic capacity that warrant investigation with respect to microgravity include endocrine/reproductive function, vascular control, bone mineral density/microarchitecture, and soft-tissue health. The purpose of this investigation is two-fold: 1) to summarize the data available from space flight and simulated bed rest analog exposures to begin addressing these gaps in knowledge regarding impacts to female astronaut health, and 2) to describe differences in demographic health characteristics, injury prevalence, and aerobic capacity and muscular strength in NASA female and male astronauts. Female astronauts make up 50% of Artemis-specific astronaut corps and the extent to which microgravity exposure impacts female cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health, and whether these alterations are consistent with their male counterparts, is inconclusive. With the growing inclusion of female astronauts in the NASA space program and the increased duration of missions beyond low Earth orbit, a greater understanding of the sex-specific adaptation to space travel will help determine the development of appropriate countermeasures for minimizing risk and maintaining health of all astronauts."

However, any RTA scheme must itself be trusted before it can be deployed into use: i.e., it must be fit for its intended purpose, and it must not itself introduce safety hazards. This report contains preliminary recommendations on the application and integration of RTA into aeronautical products intended for use in civil aviation. The main purpose of these recommendations is to inform regulatory guidance and consensus standards that may be used to meet the safety intent of the applicable regulations."

Test problems will be used to showcase the accuracy and utility of this technique and to demonstrate its superiority over the more common technique of spherical spreading projection. Three versions of the technique will be presented: planar, cylindrical, and spherical. Depending on the nature of the acoustic field, one or more of these versions may be useful and practical to use. Since the cylindrical and spherical versions depend on the accurate numerical computations of certain special functions, such as the Hankel functions and the associated Legendre polynomials, the implementation of the high-precision numerical computation of the required special functions on a computer are included in the appendixes at the end of the report. In some cases, the material presented in these appendixes represents a substantial extension of the results previously published in the open literature. As appropriate, special considerations associated with the use of the AH technique in practical situations are discussed."
