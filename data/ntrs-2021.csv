Today, volatile chemical products (VCPs) are responsible for half of the petrochemical VOCs emitted in major urban areas. We show that VCP emissions are ubiquitous in US and European cities and scale with population density. We report significant VCP emissions for New York City (NYC), including a monoterpene flux of 14.7 to 24.4 kg ⋅ d−1 ⋅ km−2 from fragranced VCPs and other anthropogenic sources, which is comparable to that of a summertime forest. Photochemical modeling of an extreme heat event, with ozone well in excess of US standards, illustrates the significant impact of VCPs on air quality. In the most populated regions of NYC, ozone was sensitive to anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs), even in the presence of biogenic sources. Within this VOC-sensitive regime, AVOCs contributed upwards of ∼20 ppb to maximum 8-h average ozone. VCPs accounted for more than 50% of this total AVOC contribution. Emissions from fragranced VCPs, including personal care and cleaning products, account for at least 50% of the ozone attributed to VCPs. We show that model simulations of ozone depend foremost on the magnitude of VCP emissions and that the addition of oxygenated VCP chemistry impacts simulations of key atmospheric oxidation products. NYC is a case study for developed megacities, and the impacts of VCPs on local ozone are likely similar for other major urban regions across North America or Europe."

The melt growth of Cd0.8Zn0.2Te crystals were then processed by directional solidification under controlled Cd overpressure. During the growth experiments, several procedures have been developed to improve the crystalline quality: (1) minimizing the contamination of impurities (2) improving the structural defects and (3) minimizing the Te-precipitates within the grown crystals to enhance charge transport properties. Additionally, the thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient of a vapor-grown CdTe and two melt-grown Cd0.8Zn0.2Te crystals were measured between 190oC and 780oC to provide an in-depth understanding of the thermal and electrical conduction mechanisms of the crystals as well as the prospect of its thermoelectric applications."

Available data from a recent experiment in the National Transonic Facility at the NASA Langley Research Center are used to assess the current transition modeling capability in NASA's OVERFLOW 2.2o code for a swept wing configuration at transonic cruise conditions. Specifically, the OVERFLOW solutions are used together with detailed stability analysis of the boundary layer flow over the new Common Research Model with Natural Laminar Flow (CRM-NLF) to evaluate the accuracy and the robustness of the transport-equation-based transition models, with the goal of proposing improvements that would help to strengthen the physical basis of these models for the important class of flows involving the combined effects of crossflow and flow compressibility. Results highlight the significant underprediction of the laminar flow extent within the inboard region of the wing, wherein the onset of transition may be attributed to a gradual amplification of Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities."

This paper represents a continuation of our numerical investigation of the flow instabilities over the main test surface of the BOLT configuration by using state-of-the-art tools in multidimensional instability analysis. Specifically, the paper extends our previous computations by considering the separate effects of a nonzero angle-of-attack and a nonzero yaw on the modal instability characteristics of the boundary layer streaks adjacent to the minor-axis symmetry plane. At a selected condition from the ascent part of the anticipated flight trajectory, either type of departure from the design condition is shown to have a considerable impact on the structure of the laminar basic state and, hence, also on the amplification characteristics of the instability waves. A broader set of computations, including N-factor predictions for the relevant instabilities, will be presented in the final paper."

We find that the effective climate sensitivity is a non-monotonic function of CO2 in both models, reaching a minimum at 3×CO2 for GISS-E2.1-G, and 4×CO2 for CESM-LE. A similar non-monotonic response is found in Northern Hemisphere surface temperature, sea-ice, precipitation, the latitude of zero precipitation minus-evaporation, and the strength of the Hadley cell. Interestingly, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation collapses when non-monotonicity appears and does not recover for larger CO2 forcings. Analyzing the climate response over the same CO2 range with slab ocean versions of the same models, we demonstrate that the climate system's non-monotonic response is linked to ocean dynamics."

We quantify the possible impacts on global supplies and prices of wheat, rice and maize. We show that local production declines have moderate impacts on global prices and supply – but trade restrictions and precautionary purchases by a few key actors could create global food price spikes and severe local food shortages."
6,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205004283,2023-08-03,Tropical Cyclones in Global Storm-Resolving Models,"Recent progress in computing and model development has initiated the era of global storm-resolving modeling, and with it the potential to transform weather and climate prediction. Within the general theme of vetting this new class of models, the present study evaluates nine global-storm resolving models in their ability to simulate tropical cyclones (TCs). Results indicate that, broadly speaking, the models produce realistic TCs and remove longstanding issues known from global models such as the deficiency in accurately simulating TC intensity. However, TCs are strongly affected by model formulation, and all models suffer from unique biases regarding the number of TCs, intensity, size, and structure. Some models simulated TCs better than others, but no single model was superior in every way. The overall results indicate that global storm-resolving models can open a new chapter in TC prediction, but they need to be improved to unleash their full potential."
7,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205004477,2023-08-03,A Study into Validating a Coupled Method of Characteristics and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method Against Empirical Data,"The following will outline the methodology and results of validating a coupled Method of Characteristics (MOC) and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. This research focused specifically on modeling plume impingement, induced by Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters that flew on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) space shuttle Discovery. For each simulation, the continuum portion of the RCS thruster was simulated using MOC for solving hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and computed with the NASA code, Reacting and Multi-phase Program (RAMP). The solution was then implemented as a starting condition into the NASA DSMC code, Direct Simulation and Monte Carlo Analysis Code (DAC). Typically, DSMC models rely on code-to-code validation for fidelity. The significance of this research is in its ability to validate its models against empirical data. Prior to computing solutions for these simulations, the mesh size and structure were optimized and many variants of DSMC input parameters were iterated on in order to acquire a reliable, mesh-independent, fully optimized numerical solution. This research will discuss the mathematical formulation of MOC for nozzle flow and DSMC for rarefied gases. Additionally, it will provide an explanation of how to implement these mathematical concepts into the two solvers: RAMP and DAC. Ultimately, this research will demonstrate that the overall process illustrated produces results in good agreement with empirical data. As a consequence, the methodology presented is granted an increased level of confidence and will greatly contribute to the aerospace industry and its effort in understanding and predicting rarefied flow fields."

An overview of the network assumptions and autopilot performance bounds required to meet the coordination objective will be provided. In particular, we will leverage passivity-based stability conditions for bidirectional networks that require the communication graph to be connected in an integral sense, but may fail to connect pointwise in time during the entire mission. Non-ideal autopilots that can only track a desired speed profile with a prescribed precision induce an error in vehicle coordination. The autopilot performance bounds will be propagated through the coordination dynamics to understand the limits introduced by autopilots."
9,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205007285,2023-08-03,"Bioinspired Honeycomb Core Design: An Experimental Study of the Role of Corner Radius, Coping, and Interface","The honeybee’s nest has inspired the design of engineering honeycomb core that primarily abstract the hexagonal cell shape and exploit its mass minimizing properties to construct lightweight panels. This work explored three additional design features that are part of the natural honeybee comb but have not been traditionally considered as design features of interest in honeycomb design: the radius at the corner of each cell, the coping at the top of the cell walls, and the interface between cell arrays. These features were first characterized in natural honeycomb using optical and X-ray techniques, and then incorporated into honeycomb core design, and fabricated using an additive manufacturing process. The honeycomb cores were then tested in out-of-plane compression and bending, and since all three design features added mass to the overall structure, all metrics were examined per unit mass to assess performance gains. The study concluded that the addition of an interface increases specific flexural modulus but has little benefit in out-of-plane compression; coping radius positively impacts specific flexural strength; but that the corner radius has no significant effect in bending, and actually is slightly detrimental for out-of-plane compression testing."
10,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210000908,2023-08-03,The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: delensed power spectra and parameters,"We present ΛCDM cosmological parameter constraints obtained from delensed microwave background power spectra. Lensing maps from a subset of DR4 data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) are used to undo the lensing effect in ACT spectra observed at 150 and 98 GHz. At 150 GHz, we remove the lensing distortion with an effective efficiency of 30% (T T), 30% (EE), 26% (T E) and 20% (BB); this results in detections of the delensing effect at 8.7σ (T T), 5.1σ (EE), 2.6σ (T E), and 2.4σ (BB) significance. The combination of 150 and 98 GHz T T, EE, and T E delensed spectra is well fit by a standard ΛCDM model. We also measure the shift in best-fit parameters when fitting delensed versus lensed spectra; while this shift does not inform our ability to measure cosmological parameters, it does provide a three-way consistency check among the lensing inferred from the best-fit parameters, the lensing in the CMB power spectrum, and the reconstructed lensing map. This shift is predicted to be zero when fitting with the correct model since both lensed and delensed spectra originate from the same region of sky. Fitting with a ΛCDM model and marginalizing over foregrounds, we find that the shift in cosmological parameters is consistent with zero. Our results show that gravitational lensing of the microwave background is internally consistent within the framework of the standard cosmological model."
11,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210000972,2023-08-03,"Air Pollution Trends Measured From Terra: CO and AOD Over Industrial, Fire-prone, and Background Regions","Following past studies to quantify decadal trends in global carbon monoxide (CO) using satellite observations, we update estimates and find a CO trend in column amounts of about −0.50 % per year between 2002 to 2018, which is a deceleration compared to analyses performed on shorter records that found −1 % per year. Aerosols are co-emitted with CO from both fires and anthropogenic sources but with a shorter lifetime than CO. A combined trend analysis of CO and aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from space helps to diagnose the drivers of regional differences in the CO trend. We use the long-term records of CO from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and AOD from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. Other satellite instruments measuring CO in the thermal infrared, AIRS, TES, IASI, and CrIS, show consistent hemispheric CO variability and corroborate results from the trend analysis performed with MOPITT CO. Trends are examined by hemisphere and in regions for 2002 to 2018, with uncertainties quantified. The CO and AOD records are split into two sub-periods (2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2018) in order to assess trend changes over the 16 years. We focus on four major population centers: Northeast China, North India, Europe, and Eastern USA, as well as fire-prone regions in both hemispheres. In general, CO declines faster in the first half of the record compared to the second half, while AOD trends show more variability across regions. We find evidence of the atmospheric impact of air quality management policies. The large decline in CO found over Northeast China is initially associated with an improvement in combustion efficiency, with subsequent additional air quality improvements from 2010 onwards. Industrial regions with minimal emission control measures such as North India become more globally relevant as the global CO trend weakens. We also examine the CO trends in monthly percentile values to understand seasonal implications and find that local changes in biomass burning are sufficiently strong to counteract the global downward trend in atmospheric CO, particularly in late summer."
12,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210000009,2023-08-03,The 2019-2020 Australian drought and bushfires altered the partitioning of hydrological fluxes,"Though coarse in spatial resolution, the nearly all weather measurements from passive microwave sensors can help in improving the spatiotemporal coverage of optical and thermal infrared sensors for monitoring vegetation changes on the land surface. This study demonstrates the use of vegetation optical depth retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission for capturing the vegetation alterations from the recent 2019-2020 Australian bushfires and drought. The impact of vegetation disturbance s on terrestrial water budget is examined by assimilating the vegetation optical depth retrievals into a dynamic phenology model. The results demonstrate that assimilating vegetation optical depth observations lead to improved simulation of evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture states. The study also demonstrates that the vegetation changes from the 2019-2020 Australian drought and fires led to significant modifications in the partitioning of evaporative and runoff fluxes, resulting in increased bare soil evaporation, reduced transpiration, and higher runoff."
13,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210000093,2023-08-03,Center for High-Efficiency Electrical Technologies for Aircraft (CHEETA),"The aeronautics industry has been challenged on many fronts to increase efficiency, reduce emissions, and decrease dependency on carbon-based fuels.  With subsonic transports serving as the dominant contributor to the fuel consumption and carbon footprint of global aviation, the need for environmentally-responsible transportation has been met with a boom of research in the field of aircraft propulsion electrification across industry, government, and academic organizations.  However, adoption of electrified propulsion systems for large commercial aircraft today is unattainable, due to the lack of motors and power electronics appropriately sized for these vehicles, high weight requirements of conventional electrical energy storage systems, and new principles required to design these classes of aircraft. The mission of the Center for High-Efficiency Electrical Technologies for Aircraft (CHEETA) program is to develop, mature, and design disruptive technologies for electric commercial aviation.  The associated technologies being researched include distributed aero-propulsion system integration, high-efficiency electrochemical power conversion, flight-weight electric machines and power electronics, materials and systems for superconducting high-efficiency power transmission, and methods for complex system integration and optimization.  Additionally, the current program is investigating the use of unconventional energy storage and power generation architectures, such as liquid hydrogen fuel and high-efficiency fuel cell systems. The research program provides a direct line-of-sight to not only achieving, but potentially even exceeding the aviation community goals for transition to alternative propulsion and energy through convergence of various novel technologies.  The end result of maturation and integration of these technologies is an aircraft system with a quiet, efficient propulsion system that produces zero carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter emissions at the vehicle level."

Our team will study and mature technologies as detailed below to develop an ecosystem for the qualification of AM machines, which in turn supports the certification of part production. Additive manufacturing offers unique opportunities for the aviation industry in the fabrication of original components and replacement parts.  Aggressive use of metals AM has, for example, allowed the rapid development and production of new launch vehicle designs, at substantially reduced costs.  Aviation has unique challenges, such as higher production volumes, but the potential value of integrating AM into aviation manufacturing is clear. To implement the ecosystem for AM qualification, the team will run a set of six multi-disciplinary projects. Each of these projects will address a current barrier to AM process qualification, and efficient production."

To combat this, an extensive flight test campaign, described herein, was conducted to gather acoustic data to support helicopter noise research (e.g., physics-based modeling, operational planning, etc.). Acoustic measurements were collected from four helicopters in the medium-sized weight class with maximum takeoff gross weights between 7,400 and 14,200 lb: a Bell 205 “Huey”, a Sikorsky S-76D, a Leonardo AW139, and a US Coast Guard MH-65 Dolphin (a variant of the commercial Airbus AS365 Dauphin). Each aircraft per- formed a subset of level flyovers, steady descents, turns with various initial conditions, and noise abatement approaches. A distributed ground microphone array spanning approximately 2,000 by 4,000 ft collected measurements of each flyover event. Additionally, a dedicated semicircular microphone array was used for gathering acoustic measurements of static conditions (e.g., hover). This report provides an overview of the flight test methodology, conditions tested, equipment used, and details of the accompanying distribution dataset. Figures of sample results generated for each test point are included to enable comparison and selection of the data at the discretion of the user. Specifically, source noise hemispheres of the steady flight conditions illustrate directivity of over- all levels. Noise contours over the array provide insight into the ground levels associated with approaches and turning events. These data figures are derived from the original acoustic pressure-time histories and vehicle tracking data that are provided in the distribution dataset."

The mixed-fidelity low-boom MDO problem aims to enforce the weight consistency for CFD-based low-boom inverse design optimization: the optimum low-boom configuration is designed for the weight at the start of cruise of the same configuration for the low-boom overland mission. Moreover, it also seeks the optimum trades among the maximum takeoff gross weight (MTOGW), cruise Mach, and range for the low-boom overland mission while meeting the requirement of flying a transatlantic overwater mission. A block coordinate optimization (BCO) method is developed to find an approximate solution of the mixed-fidelity low-boom MDO problem. The BCO method is successfully applied to generate two CFD-based low-boom configurations that closely match two reversed equivalent area targets with ground noise levels below 70 PLdB, respectively. Moreover, these CFD-based low-boom configurations can be obtained with minor wing modifications from the solutions of the low-fidelity MDO problem. The low-fidelity MDO solutions are Pareto points for constrained multiobjective optimization of MTOGW, low-boom cruise Mach, and low-boom range. The best low-boom concept has a predetermined fuselage shape tailored for passengers and main gear storage, carries 40 passengers at seat pitch of 48 in, flies a low-boom overland mission with cruise Mach of 1.8 and range of 2,950 nm, cruises overwater at Mach 1.8 with range of 3,600 nm, satisfies the specified constraints for landing/cruise/takeoff, has MTOGW of 145,164 lb, trims the low-boom cruise flight with fuel redistributions instead of control surface deflections, and has a reversed equivalent area distribution closely matching a target with ground noise level below 70 PLdB."

Here, we report the bulk amino acid content of three iron meteorites (Campo del Cielo, IAB; Canyon Diablo, IAB; and Cape York, IIIAB) and both the metal and silicate portions of a pallasite (Imilac). We developed a novel method to prepare the samples for analysis, followed by hot water extraction and analysis via liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry. Free amino acid abundances ranging from 301 to 1216 pmol/g were observed in the meteorites, with the highest abundance in the silicate portion of the pallasite. Although some of the amino acid content could be attributed to terrestrial contamination, evidence suggests that some compounds are indigenous. A suite of C(5) amino acids was observed with a distinct distribution favoring a straight chain (n‐pentanoic acid) structure; this straight chain dominance is suggestive of that observed in thermally altered stony meteorites. Amino acids were also observed in terrestrial iron granules that were milled and analyzed in the same way as the meteorites, although the distribution of detected amino acids was different. It is possible that similar formation mechanisms existed in both the meteorites and the terrestrial iron, or that observed amino acids resulted from reactions of precursors during sample preparation. This work suggests that iron meteorites should not be overlooked for contributions of amino acids and likely other soluble organic molecules to the early Earth. Future studies of iron–nickel meteorites and asteroids, such as Psyche, may provide further insights into their potential organic inventory."

Its version 6 (V6) profileswere  processed  and  archived  in  2002.  We  present  severaldiagnostic  examples  of  the  quality  of  the  V6  stratospheric species distributions based on their level 3 zonal Fourier co-efficient products. In particular, we show that there are smalldifferences in the ascending (A) minus descending (D) or-bital temperature–pressure orT(p) profiles (theirA−Dval-ues) that affect (A−D) species values. SystematicA−Dbi-ases inT(p) can arise from small radiance biases and/or fromviewing anomalies along orbits. There can also be (A−D)differences inT(p) due to not resolving and correcting forall of the atmospheric temperature gradient along LIMS tan-gent view-paths. An error inT(p) affects species retrievalsthrough (1) the Planck blackbody function in forward calcu-lations of limb radiance that are part of the iterative retrievalalgorithm of LIMS, and (2) the registration of the measuredLIMS species radiance profiles in pressure altitude, mainlyfor the lower stratosphere. There are clearA−Ddifferencesfor ozone, H2O, and HNO3but not for NO2. Percentage differences are larger in the lower stratosphere for ozone andH2O because those species are optically thick. We evaluateV6  ozone  profile  biases  in  the  upper  stratosphere  with  the aid  of  comparisons  against  a  monthly  climatology  of  UV–ozone soundings from rocketsondes. We also provide resultsof time series analyses of V6 ozone, H2O, and potential vor-ticity for the middle stratosphere to show that their average(A+D) V6 level 3 products provide a clear picture of the evolution of those tracers during Northern Hemisphere win-ter. We recommend that researchers use the average V6 level3 product for their science studies of stratospheric ozone andH2O, while keeping in mind that there are uncorrected non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects in daytime ozone inthe lower mesosphere and in daytime H2O in the uppermoststratosphere. We also point out that the present-day Soundingof the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry(SABER) experiment provides measurements and retrievalsof temperature and ozone that are nearly free of anomalousdiurnal variations and of effects from gradients at low and middle latitudes."

Many body simulations are not generally performed in plane wave basis sets on classical hardware, but with newly proposed quantum algorithms, it is possible this will be a highly efficient basis set to run quantum simulations on quantum hardware.  Using state of the art classical simulations we ran small test simulations to estimate the resources that will be needed to run such plane wave algorithms on quantum hardware.

While a variety of remote sensing-based burn severity indices have been developed, the Landsat-based differ-enced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) presents the most widely-used approach to burn severity assessment for fire research and management. Although dNBR-based approaches have been continuously updated, including the development of the relative dNBR (RdNBR) and the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), one key obstacle for the reliable applications of the burn severity indices in the high northern latitudes has not been adequately addressed. Specifically, optimal Landsat image pairs are very rarely available for the calculation of the burn severity indices in certain regions of the high northern latitudes (HNL), resulting in the burn severity index outputs calculated for a large number of wildfires being considerably affected by non-fire-related factors. The suboptimal selection of image pairs may have partially contributed to the lack of consistency in the performance of the burn severity indices in the HNL regions. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the impacts of sub-optimal image pairs on signal stability through two sets of analyses conducted at different spatial scales. First, at the regional scale, we examined the burn severity indices calculated for a selection of wildfires in Alaska. Here, we demonstrate the inconsistent performance of the same index calculated based on Landsat data that are typically considered as “optimal”. In addition, we show that the calculated indices may be more prone to the negative impacts of these inconsistencies, thus leading to reduced reliability, when there is limited Landsat data availability. Second, at the continental scale, we show that certain areas in the HNL, especially Alaska during the pre-2000 era, are subject to the potentially strong negative impact associated with the limited data availability. Through systematically analyzing this issue, we hope to not only divert more attention to it but also to provide potential solutions, based on which further improvements that may be of particular importance for research on Arctic wildfires could be made."

These science priorities are aligned with NASA’s three major astrophysics science goals: How does the Universe work? How did we get here? and Are we alone?

The science trace-ability matrix prescribes the design of Origins and demonstrates that it will address the key science questions motivated by the science case."

The system (optimized to test engines and components generating up to 10K lbf nominal thrust) is serving as a testbed for innovative technologies and processes to provide lower cost test services with a rapid test cadence and expedient turnaround times. The system can also potentially be used as a testbed to test other related technologies relevant to surface situations (e.g., moon, Mars associated with crogenic fluid management, engine/component testing, autonomous operations, etc.).  This FY20 CIF project, being conducted as part of the SMART testbed system, is developing and testing a propellant delivery system via electrically driven centrifugal pumps (obviating dependence upon Multi-Layer Pressure Vessels) with configuration and operation by a minimal number of personnel. During FY20 the team identified the requirements and worked with P3 and Masten Space Systems to develop the long lead (9 months after receipt of order) items, the 400 VDC pumps, for delivery in mid FY21. Since control of the 400 VDC pump motor is not well developed the team has established heuristics to control flows in LN2 at off nominal shaft speeds to allow deep throttling of the pump in flow test scenarios. Various test scenarios including nominal i.e. high flow high pressure, high flow low pressure, low flow high pressure, low flow low pressure, minimum throttle step change, and low inlet pressure cavitation testing were developed ahead of the anticipated hardware delivery and test. FY20 COVID Stage 3 conditions restricted access to the center and hindered lab work, so efforts focused on the system design and testing plans along with the project procurement paperwork for the hardware... now with its anticipated delivery in spring FY21.

A literature review that identified bench-scale stainless steel fatigue data at cryogenic temperatures that can be used to validate fatigue life mathematical models was pursued. Developing the ability to predict the fatigue life of RTDs/thermo-wells in high-pressure, cryogenic flow environments, especially liquid oxygen (LOX), will lead to a lower incidence of RTD damage and failure during propulsion test activities. During this performance period, the project was transitioned to a computational RTD/thermos-well fatigue modeling effort rather than the previously proposed experimental fatigue testing in FY19 since the computational modeling approach will provide a better fundamental understanding of fatigue behavior at cryogenic temperatures prior to pursuing potentially costly experimental tests.  Due to COVID-19 issues impairing access to some needed university partnerships, tools and lab facilities, FY20efforts are continuing into FY21 and will be reported upon in greater detail in the FY21 report"

The 5.36 minute period is seen as a large amplitude, soft X-ray modulation, likely resulting from a hot-spot produced by direct impact accretion. With such a7short orbital period it is expected to have a gravitational wave luminosity comparable8to or larger than that in the X-ray, and its orbital frequency is known to be increasing9at a rate consistent with the expected loss of angular momentum due to gravitational radiation. We use recent Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer(NICER) observations to extend its long-term X-ray timing baseline to almost 20 yr. Phase coherent timing of these new data combined with existing Chandra data demonstrates conclusively that the rate of orbital frequency increase is slowing, and we measure a non-zero f0=8.95 ± 1.4 x 1027 Hz s2, to our knowledge the first such measurement of its kind for any compact astrophysical binary.  With the simultaneous high precision measurement of f0= 3.557 ± 0.005 x 1016 Hz s1, we estimate that the system17will reach its maximum orbital frequency of fmax 3.1172091 mHz in 1,260 ± 200 yr, indicating that the system is close to its epoch of maximum orbital frequency. Assuming mass transfer is conservative, the measurement of f<0 implies that the20accretion rate from the donor is growing, with 5.4 x 1010<M2<4.0 x 1010 M⊙yr2. Further quantitative comparisons with theoretical models should enable more precise inferences regarding its current evolutionary state."

We expand the related observational datasets by obtaining simultaneous quasi-static electric field observations over coastal land, near-shore water, and deep ocean regions during both fair-weather and thunderstorm periods. Oceanic observations were obtained using two 3-m NOAA buoys that were instrumented with Campbell Scientific electric field mills to measure the quasi-static electric fields. These data were compared to selected electric field records from the existing on-shore electric field mill suite of 31 sensors at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Lightning occurrence times, locations and peak current estimates for both onshore and ocean were provided by the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network. The buoy instruments were first evaluated on-shore at the Florida coast, and the first system was calibrated for field enhancements and to confirm proper behavior of the system in elevated-field environments. The buoys were then moored 20 mi and 120 mi off the coast of KSC in February (20 mi) and August (120 mi) 2014. Diurnal fair-weather fields at both ocean sites matched will with each other and with those found during the Carnegie cruise, but mean values were 33% smaller, due at least in-part to constraints on the calibration procedure. Diurnal fair-weather fields variations at coastal and inland sites were a poorer match than offshore, likely because the offshore environment is “cleaner” with limited variations in local space charge, lower surface aerosol densities, little surface heating to disturb the surface charge layer during fair weather, and fewer local radioactive sources to modulate the near-surface electrical conductivity. Storm-related static fields were 4-5× larger at both oceanic sites than over land, likely due to decreased screening by near-surface space charge produced by corona current. The time-evolution of the electric field and field changes during storm approach are sufficiently different over land and ocean to warrant further study. This work shows the quality, accuracy, and reliability of these data, and has demonstrated the practicality of off-shore electric field measurements for safety- and launch-related decision making at KSC."

Remote sensing observations are used to detect dust and aerosols in the atmosphere using long established techniques. False color Red-Green-Blue (RGB) imagery using band differences sensitive to dust absorption (Dust RGB) is currently used operationally to assist forecasters and decision-makers in identifying dust at night, but there are still limitations, subjectivity, and nuances to image interpretation making night-time dust identification difficult even for experts. This study applies machine learning to the problem of night-time dust detection with a simple random forest (RF) model using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) infrared imagery, band differences sensitive to dust absorption, and Dust RGB color components as inputs to the model. The RF model achieves an Area-Under-Curve (AUC) of 0.97 with a standard deviation of 0.04 for dust cases. For images with dust present, the model correctly labels 85% of dust pixels and 99.96% of no-dust pixels for all dust images in the validation data set. The addition of a single null case to the training data set drastically reduces error in labeling no-dust pixels as dust from 45% to 14.5%. Application of the machine learning model to the April 13–14, 2019 dust event demonstrates the ability of the model to identify dust during night-time hours when visual dust detection is limited by the cooling ground surface characteristics."

The Terra and Aqua MODIS and S-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS TEB calibration uses a nonlinear algorithm whose nonlinear coefficients rely on on-orbit blackbody (BB) warm-up and cooldown operations for updates. However, a limited BB temperature range affects the calibration’s accuracy particularly for cold scenes. The deep convective clouds (DCC) core, one of the coldest Earth scenes, is suitable for MODIS calibration assessments; more specifically, for the evaluation of the offset term’s effect in its TEB quadratic calibration function. Moreover, nighttime qDCC measurements provide with the advantage of removing solar reflectance effects during daytime, thus enhancing the assessment’s accuracy for the midwave infrared TEB. In this paper, this qDCC method is applied to the Terra MODIS and VIIRS TEB; and their stabilities are assessed using long-term qDCC trending measurements over the instruments’ missions. The measurements from bands with an 11-μm wavelength are used to identify the DCC pixels. The 11-μm bands, MODIS band 31 and VIIRS bands M15 and I5, are stable throughout the MODIS and VIIRS missions and have shown excellent calibration accuracy and noise performance. Hence, using these bands as references, a normalization method is employed to enhance the accuracy of the stability and consistency assessments. The S-NPP VIIRS TEB show stable trends over the instrument’s mission. The S-NPP-to-N20 VIIRS comparison shows their TEB measurements are consistent over qDCC. The Terra MODIS TEB also show stable performance – except for bands 27, 29, and 30. Terra MODIS band 30 shows a large downward trend throughout the mission, while bands 27 and 29 show slight, upward drifts. Lastly, a calibration correction using qDCC assessments is discussed and intended to be used in a future calibration algorithm collection."

A recent study on the International Space Station showed that mice exhibited a novel circling behavior during spaceflight (Ronca 2019). However, there is still a gap in knowledge on how microgravity impacts behavior. In this current study, we performed 30 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) on four-month old female mice and analyzed select behavior from video image capture. We also determined the effects of PLacental-eXpanded stromal cells dervided from the maternal placenta (PLX-PAD), alone and in combination with HU and isolation, on behavior. We have previoulst shown that PLX-PAD mitigated select inflammatory responses and changes in cytokine expression causes by HU. In-cage behaviors were analyzed in HU or control female mice treated with 2 injections of PlasmaLyte (Sham) or PLX-PAD (n=7/group). We found that PLX-PAD decreased exploratory behaviors compared to Sham treated mice at night. Normally loaded (NL) PLX mice slept less than NL Sham mice during the day, and HU animals had signficantly higher involuntary movement during sleep compared to NL animals, suggesting sleep distruption. Overall, we show that both HU and PLX affect important behavioral factors., This experiment is the first to study the effects of PLX-PAD on behavior. Additional studies are needed to define the behavioral changes in spaceflight and test possible countermeasures.

Since beginning operation, they have continued to collect valuable remote sensing data of the Earth in 36 spectral bands ranging in wavelengths from 0.41 to 14.5 μm. The Level 1B (L1B) algorithm produces calibrated top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances for each Earth-view (EV) pixel and calibrated TOA reflectances for the reflective solar bands using geo-located, uncalibrated instrument data and calibration look up tables (LUTs) produced regularly by the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST). The L1B algorithm also calculates an uncertainty value for each EV pixel. The calibrated radiance and reflectance products are used to generate higher-level science products. A separate L1B code version is maintained for both MODIS instruments so that sensor specific issues can be handled individually. The current L1B algorithm version produces the Collection 6.1 (C6.1) products and was released in 2017. An overview of the C6.1 algorithm is provided together with improvements made since its release. Also discussed briefly are the planned improvements in the Collection 7 L1B algorithm."

To better understand this global hazard, the Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model was developed previously. LHASA version 1 combines satellite precipitation estimates with a global landslide susceptibility map to produce a gridded map of potentially hazardous areas from 60° North-South every 3 h. LHASA version 1 categorizes the world’s land surface into three ratings: high, moderate, and low hazard with a single decision tree that first determines if the last seven days of rainfall were intense, then evaluates landslide susceptibility. LHASA version 2 has been developed with a data-driven approach. The global susceptibility map was replaced with a collection of explanatory variables, and two new dynamically varying quantities were added: snow and soil moisture. Along with antecedent rainfall, these variables modulated the response to current daily rainfall. In addition, the Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was supplemented with several inventories of rainfall-triggered landslide events. These factors were incorporated into the machine-learning framework XGBoost, which was trained to predict the presence or absence of landslides over the period 2015–2018, with the years 2019–2020 reserved for model evaluation. As a result of these improvements, the new global landslide nowcast was twice as likely to predict the occurrence of historical landslides as LHASA version 1, given the same global false positive rate. Furthermore, the shift to probabilistic outputs allows users to directly manage the trade-off between false negatives and false positives, which should make the nowcast useful for a greater variety of geographic settings and applications. In a retrospective analysis, the trained model ran over a global domain for 5 years, and results for LHASA version 1 and version 2 were compared. Due to the importance of rainfall and faults in LHASA version 2, nowcasts would be issued more frequently in some tropical countries, such as Colombia and Papua New Guinea; at the same time, the new version placed less emphasis on arid regions and areas far from the Pacific Rim. LHASA version 2 provides a nearly real-time view of global landslide hazard for a variety of stakeholders."

Here, we report on the successful recovery of meteorites. Additional astrometric data refine the approach orbit and define the spin period and shape of the asteroid. Video observations of the fireball constrain the asteroid's position in its orbit and were used to triangulate the location of the fireball's main flare over the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. Twenty-three meteorites were recovered. A consortium study of eight of these classifies Motopi Pan as an HED polymict breccia derived from howardite, cumulate and basaltic eucrite, and diogenite lithologies. Before impact, 2018 LA was a solid rock of ~156 cm diameter with high bulk density ~2.85 g cm^(−3), a relatively low albedo pV ~ 0.25, no significant opposition effect on the asteroid brightness, and an impact kinetic energy of ~0.2 kt. The orbit of 2018 LA is consistent with an origin at Vesta (or its Vestoids) and delivery into an Earth-impacting orbit via the ν6 resonance. The impact that ejected 2018 LA in an orbit toward Earth occurred 22.8 ± 3.8 Ma ago. Zircons record a concordant U-Pb age of 4563 ± 11 Ma and a consistent 207Pb/206Pb age of 4563 ± 6 Ma. A much younger Pb-Pb phosphate resetting age of 4234 ± 41 Ma was found. From this impact chronology, we discuss what is the possible source crater of Motopi Pan and the age of Vesta's Veneneia impact basin."

Little is known about Kuiper Belt Objects in the scientific community with most of the information coming from Pluto. Currently, NASA is designing an unmanned probe to explore the atmosphere and surface of Triton. This vehicle is unique in that it repeatedly takes off and lands (hops) using nitrogen propellant collected from its surroundings on Triton. This paper presents preliminary conceptual system design and numerical modeling of the atmospheric collection process. Four concepts are presented: a cryocooler-based system, a pump-based system, a sublimation and pump-based system, and a cryocooler and sublimation system. Numerical modeling takes into account the mass and energy transfer between all the relevant nodes in the system and is able to calculate the amount of nitrogen ice collected and ice accumulation rate as a function of time for each concept. The models are ultimately used to assess the feasibility of traversing from equator to pole in under two years using a gaseous propellant acquisition system for the Hopper."

enable the movement of cargo via various levels of automated aircraft, such as aircraft
with simplified operations requiring a pilot, remotely monitored or piloted aircraft, and
fully autonomous aircraft. These investments will enable greater utilization of aircraft
while unlocking new air markets traditionally served by ground transportation only. Many
cargo companies and aerospace experts envision an operating environment where a
single pilot can remotely pilot numerous aircraft for significant increases in aircraft
utilization. The future operating environment is also expected to include air cargo
companies flying smaller aircraft from airports and distribution centers outside of major
U.S. cities directly to city centers, avoiding congested roads and increasing the velocity
of cargo shipments, particularly those that are high-value, time-sensitive, and security sensitive (e.g., pharmaceuticals). These are just a few benefits and use cases cargo
companies and aerospace experts see with the advancement of automated aircraft. 

To better understand industry’s direction, NASA asked the LMI team to research the
forecasted market, timeline, risks, and opportunities for integrating unmanned air cargo
vehicles into the National Airspace System (NAS) for the development and prioritization
of the NASA Air Traffic Management Exploration’s research portfolio. To begin the
market assessment, we gathered data via numerous interviews with key stakeholders
and subject matter experts and literature reviews. We then incorporated the data into a
custom-developed systems dynamics model and visualization dashboard. The systems
dynamics model classifies the size of the market (e.g., overall fleet size of automated
aircraft) for four distinct use cases over the next 20 years. The model projects the year in
which various types of automated aircraft will enter the commercial cargo market based
on our team’s collective research on when the aircraft will become viable due to
manufacturing and certification timelines and the lifespan of current, traditional aircraft in
service, to name a few factors. While this report defines our team’s estimated timeline of
entry and growth, the model is dynamic—it enables NASA users to change variables
based on future-year events. If the necessary technology does not mature in accordance
with our assumptions, then NASA can change the entry of service point to a future year
to evaluate the changes in market size in the out years. This flexibility will be key to

The focus is a case study of the June 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, Philippines and the period from July 1991 to February 1992. Version 2 of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting system is used in this study. GEOS-S2S includes the GOddard Chemistry, Aerosols, Radiation and Transport (GOCART) aerosol module, which allows to prognostically simulate aerosol distributions. GOCART is coupled to the radiation and cloud modules to include the impact of the eruption on forecasted radiation and precipitation. The coupled GEOS-S2S system was initialized in May 1991 with fields based on observations to produce ten-member 9-month forecasts with and without the volcanic sulfur injection. The results of these ensemble experiments demonstrate that including Mt. Pinatubo in seasonal forecasts would improve the forecasts of the 1991–1992 global mean temperature and precipitation but worsen the forecast of ENSO by strengthening of El Niño beyond what showed in observations. Most significant changes in the forecasts of temperatures and precipitation are limited to the tropics. The only land area where the inclusion of Pinatubo significantly lowered the forecasted precipitation is tropical Africa."

Probing the inner regions of SS433 in the X-rays is crucial to understanding this system, and super-critical accretion in general, but is highly challenging due to obscuration by the surrounding wind, driven from the accretion flow. NuSTAR observed SS433 in the hard X-ray band across multiple
phases of its 162 day super-orbital precession period. Spectral-timing tools allow us to infer that the hard X-ray emission from the inner regions is likely being scattered towards us by the walls of the wind-cone. By comparing to numerical models, we determine an intrinsic X-ray luminosity of >= 2 x 10^37 erg/s and that, if viewed face on, we would infer an apparent luminosity of > 1 x 10^39 erg/s, confirming SS433’s long-suspected nature as an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX). We present the discovery of a narrow, ~ 100 s lag due to atomic processes occurring in outflowing material travelling at least 0.14-0.29c, which matches absorption lines seen in ULXs and – in the future – will allow us to map a super-critical outflow for the first time."

Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is a common post processing technique used to reduce the part porosity by exposing parts to high temperature and pressures. Pore closure depends on the pore shape, trapped gas, and HIP parameters, and the process can only be optimized by understanding the effect of these variables.  An analysis capability is described to better understand the conditions necessary for pore closure, and the effect of several variables on porosity are explored and compared to a baseline case.  The importance of valid material response models is identified as a significant factor in model accuracy; especially the creep material response model which, in the baseline case, predicts that creep strain accounts for 87.7% of the total strain at the conclusion of the HIP cycle.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely intense millisecond-long radio pulses of primarily extragalactic origin, and a leading attribution for their genesis focuses on magnetars. A hallmark signature of magnetars is their emission of bright, hard X-ray bursts of sub-second duration. On 27 April 2020, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 emitted hundreds of X-ray bursts within a few hours. One of these temporally coincided with an FRB, the first known detection of an FRB from the Milky Way. Here, we present spectral and temporal analyses of 24 X-ray bursts emitted 13 hours prior to the FRB and seen simultaneously with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and with the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) mission in their combined energy range of 0.2 keV to 30 MeV. These broadband spectra permit direct comparison with the spectrum of the FRB-associated X-ray burst (FRB-X). We demonstrate that all 24 NICER and GBM bursts are very similar temporally to the FRB-X, but strikingly different spectrally. The singularity of the FRB-X burst is perhaps indicative of an uncommon locale for its origin. We suggest that this event originated in quasi-polar open or closed magnetic field lines that extend to high altitudes."

Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) have become an established feature in analyses of the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN). According to the standard picture, they are launched at accretion disc scales with relativistic velocities, up to 0.3-0.4 times the speed of light. Their high kinetic power is enough to induce an efficient feedback on a galactic scale, possibly contributing to the co-evolution between the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the host galaxy. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to gain a full understanding of UFO physics and, in particular, of the forces driving their acceleration and the relation to the accretion flow from which they originate.
Aims. In this paper, we investigate the impact of special relativity effects on the radiative pressure exerted onto the outflow. The radiation received by the wind decreases for increasing outflow velocity, v, implying that the standard Eddington limit argument has to be corrected according to v. Due to the limited ability of the radiation to counteract the black hole gravitational attraction, we expect to find lower typical velocities with respect to the non-relativistic scenario.
Methods. We integrated the relativistic-corrected outflow equation of motion for a realistic set of starting conditions. We concentrated on a range of ionisations, column densities, and launching radii consistent with those typically estimated for UFOs. We explore a one-dimensional, spherical geometry and a three-dimensional setting with a rotating, thin accretion disc.
Results. We find that the inclusion of special relativity effects leads to sizeable differences in the wind dynamics and that v is reduced up to 50% with respect to the non-relativistic treatment. We compare our results with a sample of UFOs from the literature and we find that the relativistic-corrected velocities are systematically lower than the reported ones, indicating the need for an additional mechanism, such as magnetic driving, to explain the highest velocity components. Finally, we note that these conclusions, derived for AGN winds, are generally applicable."

A Sub-Neptune Transiting a Young Star in a Newly Discovered 250 Myr Association,"The detection and characterization of young planetary systems offer a direct path to study the processes that shape planet evolution. We report on the discovery of a sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting the young star HD 110082 (TOI-1098). Transit events we initially detected during TESS Cycle 1 are validated with time-series photometry from Spitzer. High-contrast imaging and high-resolution, optical spectra are also obtained to characterize the stellar host and confirm the planetary nature of the transits. The host star is a late-F dwarf (M⁎ = 1.2Mꙩ) with a low-mass, M dwarf binary companion (M⁎ = 0.26Mꙩ) separated by nearly one arcminute (∼6200 au). Based on its rapid rotation and Lithium absorption, HD 110082 is young, but is not a member of any known group of young stars (despite proximity to the Octans association). To measure the age of the system, we search for coeval, phase-space neighbors and compile a sample of candidate siblings to compare with the empirical sequences of young clusters and to apply quantitative age-dating techniques. In doing so, we find that HD 110082 resides in a new young stellar association we designate MELANGE-1, with an age of 250(+50, -70) Myr. Jointly modeling the TESS and Spitzer light curves, we measure a planetary orbital period of 10.1827 days and radius of R(p) = 3.2 ± 0.1Rꚛ. HD 110082 b’s radius falls in the largest 12% of field-age systems with similar host-star mass and orbital period. This finding supports previous studies indicating that young planets have larger radii than their field-age counterparts."

Such cloud evolution remains challenging to model. The Gulf Stream is too wide within the ERA5 and MERRA2 reanalyses, affecting the turbulent surface fluxes. Known problems within the ERA5 boundary layer (too-dry and too-cool with too strong westerlies), ascertained primarily from ACTIVATE 2020 campaign aircraft dropsondes and secondarily from older buoy measurements, reinforce surface flux biases. In contrast, MERRA2 winter surface winds and air-sea temperature/humidity differences are slightly too weak, producing surface fluxes that are too low. Reanalyses boundary layer heights in the strongly-forced winter cold-air-outbreak regime are realistic, whereas late-summer quiescent stable boundary layers are too shallow. Nevertheless, the reanalysis biases are small, and reanalyses adequately support their use for initializing higher-resolution cloud process modeling studies of cold-air outbreaks."

In order to maintain MODIS’ rich, well-calibrated archive of multispectral imagery and data, Earth targets are regularly used to track its long-term stability, as well as the consistency between the two sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Moreover, these scenes can be used to compare MODIS Earth view data over the complete scan-angle range and evaluate the on-orbit performance of the TEBs response-versus-scan-angle (RVS) over mission lifetime. This manuscript focuses on evaluating the MODIS TEBs Collection (C6.1) radiometric calibration stability for both instruments using an in situ ocean target as reference (hereafter referred to as in situ sea surface temperature (SST)). Furthermore, it will assess the calibration consistency between the MODIS sensors. Lastly, it will analyze the on-orbit RVS stability for Terra and Aqua MODIS. Only cloud-free, nighttime MODIS TEB retrievals were used for the study. A normalization methodology is applied to standardize the MODIS data to the in situ SST. Additionally, spectral corrections were derived between some of the Terra and Aqua MODIS TEBs by using a combination of the MODIS Atmospheric Profile product and MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) simulations. Results indicate that most MODIS TEBs exhibit mission-long trends of ±0.50 K – with Terra band 30 presenting the largest downward drift due to residual electronic cross-talk effects. Moreover, the calibration consistency analysis over a warm ocean target demonstrated that the average Terra-to-Aqua MODIS bias for most bands is well within ±0.50 K (bands 27 and 30 show the largest - electronic crosstalk-related - biases). Lastly, the MODIS TEBs RVS trends display changes of ±0.50 K (except for bands 25 and 27 at the end-of-scan angles) for both instruments. Overall, the MODIS TEBs remain well-calibrated and their RVSs aptly-characterized."

Moreover, typical scenes used for the calibration assessment of the thermal emissive bands (TEBs) includeDome Concordia (Dome-C), ocean, desert,  and  deep  convective  clouds  (DCC).  Reference  data  used  for  these  calibration assessments can come from another band, another instrument, or ground measurements. The Dome-C  site,  covered  with  uniformly-distributed  permanent  snow,  is  normally  used  for  the assessment  of  the  TEBsat  cold  temperatures.  Furthermore,  ocean  and  desert  measurements prove  useful  for  scenes  with  higher  temperatures.  The  DCC,  one  of  the  most  consistent  and coldest targets, can be used for the TEBs calibration and product stability assessments. MODIS band 31 (~ 11 m) can be used as a reference for these scenes. However, measurements over these  scenes  have  seasonal  variations,  and  the  DCC  brightness  temperatures  (BTs)  have asymmetrical distributions. These features can introduce additional uncertainty to the stability assessments. A  normalization  method  is  applied  by  using  an  empirical  model  to  derive reference-dependent  BTs.  Using  the  developed  empirical  model,  measurements  can  be normalized to a reference BT in order to enhance the calibration assessment’s accuracy.

Stability  assessments  over  the instruments’ entire data records are presented and discussed. The technique can be applied in future efforts to support MODIS TEBs calibration assessments."

Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are a flagship keystone wildlife species whose conservation is essential for the functioning of Bhutan’s forest ecosystems. Despite this, increasing habitat loss and human-elephant conflict continue to be detrimental to the survival of Asian elephants. The lack of information on Bhutan’s elephants and land use and land cover (LULC) trends present major challenges for Bhutan in modeling locations with suitable habitat and biological corridors for elephants. The DEVELOP Southern Bhutan Ecological Forecasting II team at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center partnered with the Bhutan Foundation, Bhutan Tiger Center, and Bhutan Ecological Society to help address this problem. The team mapped LULC in Bhutan for 2010 and 2015 by utilizing NASA Earth observations, including Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) to acquire information on historical LULC patterns and view apparent land cover change. The team used the Linkage Pathways Tool of the Linkage Mapper Toolbox in ArcMap to derive biological corridor maps from habitat suitability model outputs of the previous term and known locations of protected areas in Bhutan. The corridor maps were used to view and assess corridor suitability and connectivity between protected parks. Project results are being provided to partners to help make informed decisions on the placement and conservation of elephant movement corridors."

Unlike rigid aeroshells that are constrained by the size of the rocket’s shroud, inflatable aeroshells can be deployed to a much larger scale, thus allowing a spacecraft to begin its deceleration earlier and experience less heating. On LOFTID, there will be 4 total heat flux gauges (HFG) with a range of 70 W/cm2 and 1 radiometer with a range of 3 W/cm2, arranged as shown in Fig. 1. Both the radiometer and total HFGs are Schmidt-Boelter gauges purchased from an external vendor. 

Radiative calibrations were performed in-house at NASA Ames’ Sensors and TPS Advanced Research Laboratories (STAR Labs) before and after environmental testing to investigate how the testing affected the sensors' response. Additional rounds of radiative calibration at STAR Labs were also performed in order to investigate the large uncertainties associated with these tests. For example, a survey of multiple calibration facilities concluded that the uncertainty within a given facility was +/-3% [1]. An additional NIST study that calibrated heat flux gauges at 7 different facilities also found the variation in calibration coefficients to be up to ~3% within a given facility, but up to 15% between facilities, suggesting systematic differences between test setups [2]. Finally, the response of heat flux gauges to radiative versus convective heat flux has shown to differ by up to 20% [3],[4]. Because the heat flux gauges on LOFTID will predominantly experience convective heat flux during flight, a convective calibration study was performed at Boeing's Large-Core Arc Tunnel (LCAT) facility.

Radiative Calibration Procedure
The calibrations performed at STAR Labs utilize a quartz lamp bank (QLB) that provides a maximum heat flux of 50 W/cm2, which bounds the expected LOFTID flight environment. The calibration involves exposing a water-cooled Gardon gauge (reference) and then the unit-under-test (UUT) to 5 different heat fluxes multiple times for 10 seconds each, and then calculating a linear fit. The test setup is shown in Fig. 2. 

The total HFGs were calibrated at STAR Labs 3 times, denoted as STAR 1 (before environmental testing), STAR 2 (after protoflight vibration and thermal-vacuum testing), and STAR 3 (no change from previous test). All 8 flight-lot total HFGs showed a decrease in full-scale output from STAR 1 to STAR 2 by between 0.5% and 10. The first portion of this investigation was to determine whether the change could be due to differences in temperature between the two calibration runs. A typical linear fit to the calibration data was performed using Eq. 1 where q’ is the heat flux in W/cm2, c is the calibration coefficient, and mV is the sensor output.

To account for temperature, the data were fit to a nonlinear function that included both the sensor output (mV) and the temperature from the thermocouple embedded inside the HFG near the surface (T):  q'=mV/(c1* T + c0}.

The residuals between the fits and the actual data points were calculated for every point, and proven to be much smaller for the temperature-compensated fits than for the linear fits for all sensors. An example is shown in Fig. 3. When the temperature-compensated fits from STAR 1 were applied to the STAR 2 data, the residuals did not improve, suggesting that the change in sensitivity between these two calibration runs was not due to temperature.

A third round of calibration (STAR 3) was conducted to further address the temperature dependence of the total HFGs, and the resulting sensitivities matched closely to STAR 2 (within 2%). Temperature-compensated calibration curves were once again fit to the data. In this case, when the temperature-compensated fits from STAR 3 were applied to STAR 2 data, the residuals between the fits and STAR 2 data were much lower than the residuals due to the linear fits. This suggests that the changes seen between STAR 1 and STAR 2 were likely due to actual changes in the sensors caused by the environmental testing between the two calibrations. 

A modification of the original calibration process, in which the UUT was exposed to each heat flux for just 3 seconds (instead of 10) to reduce the temperature increase during the test, was additionally performed on several of the HFGs. In general, the sensitivities were 1-1.5% lower than from the 10-second tests, but the temperatures were also significantly lower. When the temperature-compensated fits from the 10-second tests were applied to the 3-second test data, the residuals were greatly improved than when just using the linear fits, further suggesting that the temperature-compensated fits may lead to better accuracy than the linear fits in flight. 

Convective Calibration
The second portion of this study was to create a mapping between the radiative and convective calibration coefficients. The majority of the heating during flight will be convective, so it is important to understand how the HFG response differs under these conditions. However, there are no standardized methods for convective calibration [5]. Because the TPS aerothermal response models were validated at LCAT, the same facility was chosen for convective calibration of two of the total HFGs (Fig. 4). Preliminary results showed that the full-scale output was 3% and 8% higher in convective heat flux as compared to radiative heat flux. However, tunnel variation may have contributed to noise and uncertainty in the measurements, and more testing and analysis remains to be done. 

Scope of Presentation
The presentation will include an overview of the changes seen in HFG calibration before and after environmental testing, differences between radiative and convective calibrations, the modeling work done to aid in understanding the sensor response to varying environments, and recommended future work."

Many concepts by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and industry utilize high-strength, low-weight softgoods materials, such as Vectran, as the primary load-bearing structure in inflatable habitats. Understanding the creep behavior of these materials at the yarn level, is a critical part of understanding the component and module level creep behavior that allows the design and safe use of these habitats for long duration missions. In this paper, details of two different test methods to capture the creep-rupture behavior of Vectran yarn will be documented. One method utilizes load amplification via lever-arms, while the other method utilizes a more conventional direct loading approach.

Robust position, navigation and timing (PNT) at the Moon will rely on a variety of measurement sources, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The best navigation solution will depend on mission type, the phase within each mission, the state of lunar infrastructure development at the time and a host of other considerations. No single method will provide all PNT for all scenarios, but GNSS offers a continuously available, flight-proven source of navigation and timing with unique features that make it a valuable option.  As NASA launches a new era of lunar exploration missions in 2021, development of the supporting navigation architecture is underway. This paper describes the role GNSS  could  or  will  play  in  the  components  of  NASA's  lunar  exploration  plans:  the  Artemis  missions  designed  to return humans to the lunar surface, the Gateway platform orbiting near the Moon that will host astronauts as well as science  and  technology  payloads,  and  the  robotic  lander  missions  administered  by  the  Commercial  Lunar  Payload Services  (CLPS)  program.  GNSS-based autonomous navigation has the potential to dramatically expand lunar exploration capabilities. Through the use of GNSS and GNSS-like augmentations, navigation performance could be improved while simultaneously reducing operational complexity relative to conventional, ground-based navigation methods.  As NASA begins to implement its lunar exploration plans this year and assemble the enabling communications and navigation infrastructure, GNSS will provide an important part of the diverse measurements required for robust lunar PNT."

Resolving modeled dust mineral speciation allows for spatially and temporally varying refractive indices consistent with dust aerosol composition. Here, for the first time, we quantify the range in dust DRE at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) due to current uncertainties in the surface soil mineralogical content using a dust mineral-resolving climate model. We propagate observed uncertainties in soil mineral abundances from two soil mineralogy atlases along with the optical properties of each mineral into the DRE and compare the resultant range with other sources of uncertainty across six climate models. The shortwave DRE responds region-specifically to the dust burden depending on the mineral speciation and underlying shortwave surface albedo: positively when the regionally averaged annual surface albedo is larger than 0.28 and negatively otherwise. Among all minerals examined, the shortwave TOA DRE and single scattering albedo at the 0.44–0.63 µm band are most sensitive to the fractional contribution of iron oxides to the total dust composition. The global net (shortwave plus longwave) TOA DRE is estimated to be within −0.23 to +0.35 W/sq. m. Approximately 97 % of this range relates to uncertainty in the soil abundance of iron oxides. Representing iron oxide with solely hematite optical properties leads to an overestimation of shortwave DRE by +0.10 W/sq. m at the TOA, as goethite is not as absorbing as hematite in the shortwave spectrum range. Our study highlights the importance of iron oxides to the shortwave DRE: they have a disproportionally large impact on climate considering their small atmospheric mineral mass fractional burden (∼2 %). An improved description of iron oxides, such as those planned in the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT), is thus essential for more accurate estimates of the dust DRE."

An analysis of long-term measurements at Utqiaġvik, Alaska, and McMurdo Station, Antarctica, combines lidar-validated use of soundings to identify supercooled cloud layers and colocated ground-based profiling radar measurements to quantify cloud base precipitation. We find that more than 85 % (75 %) of sampled supercooled layers are precipitating over the Arctic (Antarctic) site, with more than 75 % (50 %) precipitating continuously to the surface. Such high frequencies can be reconciled with substantially lesser spaceborne estimates by considering differences in radar hydrometeor detection sensitivity. While ice precipitation into supercooled clouds from aloft is common, we also find that the great majority of supercooled cloud layers without ice falling into them are themselves continuously generating precipitation. Such sustained primary ice formation is consistent with continuous activation of immersion-mode ice-nucleating particles (INPs), suggesting that supercooled cloud formation is a principal gateway to ice formation at temperatures greater than ∼−38 ∘C over polar regions. The prevalence of weak precipitation fluxes is also consistent with supercooled cloud longevity and with well-observed and widely simulated case studies. An analysis of colocated microwave radiometer retrievals suggests that weak precipitation fluxes can be nonetheless consequential to moisture budgets for supercooled clouds owing to small liquid water paths. The results here also demonstrate that the observed abundance of mixed-phase clouds can vary substantially with instrument sensitivity and methodology. Finally, we suggest that these ground-based precipitation rate statistics offer valuable guidance for improving the representation of polar cloud processes in large-scale models."

The only known viable populations occur in the USA along both coasts of Florida and in the western Bahamas. Little is known about habitat use and movement ecology of large juvenile and adult smalltooth sawfish. Although Critical Habitat — a management designation in the USA — has been identified for small juveniles, it has yet to be identified for these life stages. Between May 2016 and April 2019, we used passive acoustic telemetry and 3 large data sharing networks of receivers to track movements of 43 large juvenile and adult smalltooth sawfish. During this study, 24 females and 19 males were implanted with transmitters with estimated 4 or 10 yr battery lives. These tagged individuals were detected off the southeastern USA on 461 receivers ranging from off the coast of Brunswick, Georgia, to the lower Florida Keys, and along the Gulf coast  to  Apalachee  Bay,  Florida.  Seasonal  migrations  were  undertaken  by  58%  (43%  mature; 57% immature) of the tagged individuals, with the remainder being apparent residents of their tagging locations. Tagged sawfish from both size classes and of both sexes migrated, which indicates that neither sex nor length is a predictor of whether a sawfish will migrate or not. Although both coasts of Florida were used for migration, most individuals consistently used the same coast when they migrated. The areas surrounding Boca Grande, Cape Canaveral, and the lower Florida Keys  were  heavily  visited  sites  that  could  be  further  evaluated  as  potential  Critical  Habitat  for these life stages. Understanding the movement patterns of this Critically Endangered species is essential for creating policies to protect areas important for promoting growth of the population."

Our interpretations of differing trace chemical species are suggestive of redox disequilibria in Venus' middle clouds. Assignments to the data (at 51.3 km) include phosphine, hydrogen sulfide, nitrous acid, nitric acid, carbon monoxide, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen cyanide, ethane, and potentially ammonia, chlorous acid, and several tentative PxOy species. All parent ions were predicated upon assignment of corresponding fragmentation products, isotopologues, and atomic species. The data reveal parent ions at varying oxidation states, implying the presence of reducing power in the clouds, and illuminating the potential for chemistries yet to be discovered. When considering the hypothetical habitability of Venus' clouds, the assignments reveal a potential signature of anaerobic phosphorus metabolism (phosphine), an electron donor for anoxygenic photosynthesis (nitrite), and major constituents of the nitrogen cycle (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, and N2)."

We present measurements of spectral transmittance at 350–900 nm in bare glacial ice collected at a field site in the western Greenland ablation zone (67.15∘ N, 50.02∘ W). Empirical irradiance attenuation coefficients at 350–750 nm are ∼ 0.9–8.0 m−1 for ice at 12–124 cm depth. The absorption minimum is at ∼ 390–397 nm, in agreement with snow transmission measurements in Antarctica and optical mapping of deep ice at the South Pole. From 350–530 nm, our empirical attenuation coefficients are nearly 1 order of magnitude larger than theoretical values for optically pure ice. The estimated absorption coefficient at 400 nm suggests the ice volume contained a light-absorbing particle concentration equivalent to ∼ 1–2 parts per billion (ppb) of black carbon, which is similar to pre-industrial values found in remote polar snow. The equivalent mineral dust concentration is ∼ 300–600 ppb, which is similar to values for Northern Hemisphere warm periods with low aeolian activity inferred from ice cores. For a layer of quasi-granular white ice (weathering crust) extending from the surface to ∼ 10 cm depth, attenuation coefficients are 1.5 to 4 times larger than for deeper bubbly ice. Owing to higher attenuation in this layer of near-surface granular ice, optical penetration depth at 532 nm is 14 cm (20 %) lower than asymptotic attenuation lengths for optically pure bubbly ice. In addition to the traditional concept of light scattering on air bubbles, our results imply that the granular near-surface ice microstructure of weathering crust is an important control on radiative transfer in bare ice on the Greenland Ice Sheet ablation zone, and we provide new values of flux attenuation, absorption, and scattering coefficients to support model development and validation."

Wildfire smoke, which travels far from its original source, is also harmful to human health. Mixing height, which acts as a lid and prevents smoke from rising above a certain altitude in the lower troposphere, is a critical input in smoke dispersion and air quality models used by agencies that monitor wildfires. These models, coupled with forecaster expertise, are also used to decide when it is safe to execute a prescribed burn. The DEVELOPID team partnered with the National Weather Service (NWS) Fire Weather Program, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), and National Park Service (NPS) Fire Management Program Center (FMPC) to help improve reliability and confidence in mixing height estimations, and therefore the burn prescription decision-making process. To that end, the team developed a toolbox for measuring smoke-related aerosol mixing heights using Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Vertical Feature Mask granules. CALIPSO mixing heights and NWS estimations covaried significantly and positively. However, substantial disagreement between the methods stymied the team’s attempts to quantify systematic bias in a meaningful way. The relative error between the methods was especially large at low mixing heights, which suggests that this method of validation may only be suitable at higher altitudes."

These atmospheric observations are used to derive aerosol optical depth (AOD), supporting localized AOD inputs for atmospheric correction of satellite and airborne data over terrestrial and aquatic (including optically dark) targets. The ability to regionally “tune” atmospheric correction schemes with relevant spatial AOD supports constraining atmospheric correction of remote sensing reflectance.  Very wide dynamic range has been achieved for multi-channel band-pass-filter-radiometers originally designed for deployment into the water column.  By actively tracking and directly pointing to the Sun, the light attenuation by aerosol particles in the atmospheric column can be quantified.  These measurements improve knowledge of atmospheric constituents and the atmospheric corrections required to improve remote sensing capabilities for interpreting reflectance measurements from the Earth surface. 

3STAR incorporates a custom Sun-tracking/sky-scanning pointing head, a Sun-tracking camera, and a commercially available, cylindrical, 19-channel radiometer tube assembly.  An accurate and responsive mount and tracking system has been developed and certified to NASA and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) airworthiness standards for deployment into the aircraft slipstream.

Recent observations suggest that the ionizing radiation and particle environment from active cool planet hosts may be detrimental for exoplanetary habitability. Since no direct information on the radiation field is available, empirical relations between signatures of stellar activity, including the sizes and magnetic fields of starspots, are often used. Here, we revisit the empirical relation between the starspot size and the effective stellar temperature and evaluate its impact on estimates of stellar flare energies, coronal mass ejections, and fluxes of the associated stellar energetic

A single flood event on July 8th, 2019 resulted in $14.8 million in damages. These flood events routinely impact the community, often resulting in power outages, school closures, and downed trees. The Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services partnered with DEVELOP to explore how remotely sensed data could be integrated to support its current flood mitigation efforts. This project used environmental factors such as elevation, slope, and topographic wetness index from Earth observation derived data to map flood susceptibility. We utilized Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-1 C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-SAR), and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) to map historic flooding events in Fairfax County. These maps will support flood management practices for the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services through the integration of remotely sensed data. Our results show that developed areas in the county are more susceptible to flooding, coinciding with analysis of flood factors, which indicated that imperviousness and tree canopy were the most influential drivers in flood susceptibility. Other results show that using Earth observations to map historical flooding is limited in urban areas due to false positives from SAR imagery between water and shadows. Further research is necessary to evolve the historical flood mapping technique if Earth observations are to be incorporated in future historical flood analysis."

The baseline Sylramic™ SiC fibers fabricated by both vendors as well as the nitrogen-treated Sylramic™ SiC fibers are composed mostly of β-SiC (~97 wt%) with small amounts of TiB2 (~2 wt%), amorphous carbon (~1 wt%) and trace amounts of B4C. Most of the amorphous carbon is segregated at the core/interior of the fibers. Both baseline and nitrogen-treated Sylramic™ SiC fibers have similar grain size and pore size distribution, except for a thin layer of in-situ grown crystalline BN (30 to 70 nm) on the surface of Sylramic™-iBN and Super Sylramic™-iBN fibers. Wide variation in strength within a batch as well as between batches is observed in both baseline and nitrogen-treated Sylramic™ SiC fibers but both types of fibers are microstructurally stable at temperatures to 1800°C in argon and nitrogen environments compared to Nicalon™-S and Tyranno®-SA SiC fibers. Under the same creep condition, Super Sylramic™-iBN fibers show better creep resistance compared to Sylramic™, Sylramic™-iBN, Hi-Nicalon™-S, and Tyranno®-SA fibers. Possible reasons for strength variability and the mechanism of in-situ BN formation on Sylramic™ SiC fibers are discussed."

In preparation for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 2023–2032 Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey, we investigated four architectures capable of collecting and analyzing plume material from orbit and/or on the surface to address the most pressing questions at Enceladus: Is the subsurface ocean inhabited? Why, or why not? Trades specific to these four architectures were studied to allow an evaluation of the science return with respect to investment. The team found that Orbilander, a mission concept that would first orbit and then land on Enceladus, represented the best balance. Orbilander was thus studied at a higher fidelity, including a more detailed science operations plan during both orbital and landed phases, landing site characterization and selection analyses, and landing procedures.

Properties were characterized in relation to their microscopic structures. Such resins have been used recently for adhesive-free bonding of large-scale composite structures using the co-curing-ply method. In this process, two partially precured composite panels with hardener-poor (HP) off-stoichiometric resins are coupled with ply(ies) of complementary hardener-rich (HR) formulations and then cured simultaneously. This bonding process has the potential to produce reliable and certifiable composite joints without the need for additional fasteners, which are often required for many conventional bonding methods because even small amounts of contamination can cause a weak bond. The reflow and mixing of the HP/HR resin in this bonding process result in a joint with no discernable interface that should not be susceptible to surface contamination. However, incomplete mixing of the two offset resins may result in chemical heterogeneity of the cured polymeric joint. Thus, different r values may be obtained across the joint. Classical MD simulations were performed to compute the Young’s modulus of polymers with different r values and correlate their properties to network structures. High stiffness was associated with molecular packing due to chemical crosslinking, leading to a single network structure. Moreover, the networks became denser as the ratio approached the stoichiometric value r = 1. Thus, the r = 1 systems were single clusters, with high stiffness, high molecular weight, and a high degree of crosslinking. Structural properties such as radius of gyration and mean square displacement were determined to investigate the variation in the stiffness with respect to r. This MD simulation study was validated with experimental measurements."

For the reflective solar bands (RSB), the bands are calibrated on orbit using both solar diffuser (SD) and lunar observations. The lunar observations use near-monthly scheduled spacecraft maneuvers in order to view the Moon within a desired phase angle range. While the primary purpose of the maneuvers is for radiometric calibration, these observations can also be used to characterize the spatial performance of the instrument, including the band-to-band and detector-to-detector registration (BBR/DDR). The Moon can also be observed without spacecraft maneuvers. However, these observations are over a larger phase angle range. While the geometry of these unscheduled observations is more varied, they can still be used to assess the sensor performance. In this work, we will use unscheduled Moon data to analyze the BBR and DDR of the SNPP and N20 VIIRS RSB. For the BBR, we implemented an image cross-correlation approach, which removes the residual oscillations in the trending data when compared to previous methodologies. For the DDR, we developed an edge fitting approach that accounts for the lunar motion across the VIIRS focal plane array on a scan-by-scan basis using lunar and satellite ephemeris data. In our analysis, we find that the BBR and DDR for both VIIRS RSB are stable on orbit."

Hu et al. (2018) reported unexpectedly large methane enhancements over South Sudan in these observations. Here we assess methane emissions from the wetlands of South Sudan using 2 years (December 2017–November 2019) of TROPOMI total column methane observations. We estimate annual wetland emissions of 7.4 ± 3.2 Tg yr−1, which agrees with the multiyear GOSAT inversions of Lunt et al. (2019) but is an order of magnitude larger than estimates from wetland process models. This disagreement may be explained by the underestimation (by up to 4 times) of inundation extent by the hydrological schemes used in those models. We investigate the seasonal cycle of the emissions and find the lowest emissions during the June–August season when the process models show the largest emissions. Using satellite-altimetry-based river water height measurements, we infer that this seasonal mismatch is likely due to a seasonal mismatch in inundation extent. In models, inundation extent is controlled by regional precipitation scaled to static wetland extent maps, whereas the actual inundation extent is driven by water inflow from rivers like the White Nile and the Sobat. We find the lowest emissions in the highest precipitation and lowest temperature season (June–August, JJA) when models estimate large emissions. In general, our emission estimates show better agreement in terms of both seasonal cycle and annual mean with model estimates that use a stronger temperature dependence. This suggests that temperature might be a stronger control for the South Sudan wetlands emissions than currently assumed by models. Our findings demonstrate the use of satellite instruments for quantifying emissions from inaccessible and uncertain tropical wetlands, providing clues for the improvement of process models and thereby improving our understanding of the currently uncertain contribution of wetlands to the global methane budget."

Currently, rare earth (RE) silicates are the most promising systems to protect SiC based ceramics and composites. This protection is largely based on reduced silica activity in these rare earth silicates which results in a lowered reactivity with water vapor. To that end, previous Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (KEMS) studies have explored RE = Yb, Y silicates to measure the reduced silica activity and subsequent water vapor reactivity. Similarly, this work employs the KEMS technique to measure the SiO(g) vapor pressure in Lu containing RE silicates to calculate the activity of silica within the monosilicate [log(a(SiO2)) = -2351.1*1/T-1.6731] and the disilicate (log(a(SiO2)) = -4884.0*1/T + 2.2208) as a function of temperature. The enthalpies of formation for Lu monosilicate from the oxides and the elements were calculated to be -45±3 kJ/mol at 1550 K and -2831.1±12 kJ/mol at 298 K, respectively. The measured enthalpy of formation and those found in literature are compared to modeled values from density functional theory and those estimated using electronegativity."

In this work, we combined satellite retrievals, reanalysis products, and atmospheric modeling to analyze the mechanisms of aerosol–cloud interactions during two degassing events at the Kilauea volcano in 2008 and 2018. The eruptive nature of the 2008 and 2018 degassing events was distinct from long-term volcanic activity for Kilauea. Although previous studies assessed the modulation of cloud properties from the 2008 event, this is the first time such an analysis has been reported for the 2018 event and that multiple degassing events have been analyzed and compared at this location. Both events resulted in significant changes in cloud effective radius and cloud droplet number concentration that were decoupled from local meteorology and in line with an enhanced cloud albedo. However, it is likely that the effects of volcanic emissions on liquid water path and cloud fraction were largely offset by meteorological variability. Comparison of cloud anomalies between the two events suggested a threshold response of aerosol–cloud interactions to overcome meteorological effects, largely controlled by aerosol loading. In both events, the ingestion of aerosols within convective parcels enhanced the detrainment of condensate in the upper troposphere, resulting in deeper clouds than observed under pristine conditions. Accounting for ice nucleation on ash particles led to enhanced ice crystal concentrations at cirrus levels and a slight decrease in ice water content, improving the correlation of the model results with the satellite retrievals. Overall, aerosol loading, plume characteristics, and meteorology contributed to changes in cloud properties during the Kilauea degassing events."

These products are further compared against various ground-truth observations, including those from ice mass balance observations and airborne measurements. Large mean snow depth discrepancies are observed over the Atlantic and Canadian Arctic sectors. The differences between climatology and the snow products early in winter could be in part a result of the delaying in Arctic ice formation that reduces early snow accumulation, leading to shallower snowpacks at the start of the freeze-up season. These differences persist through spring despite overall more winter snow accumulation in the reanalysis-based products than in the climatologies. Among the products evaluated, the University of Washington (UW) snow depth product produces the deepest spring (March–April) snowpacks, while the snow product from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) provides the shallowest spring snow depths. Most snow products show significant correlation with snow depths retrieved from Operational IceBridge (OIB) while correlations are quite low against buoy measurements, with no correlation and very low variability from University of Bremen and DMI products. Inconsistencies in reconstructed snow depth among the products, as well as differences between these products and in situ and airborne observations, can be partially attributed to differences in effective footprint and spatial–temporal coverage, as well as insufficient observations for validation/bias adjustments. Our results highlight the need for more targeted Arctic surveys over different spatial and temporal scales to allow for a more systematic comparison and fusion of airborne, in situ and remote sensing observations."

The methodology, based on an image processing technique, can detect only light precipitation events (defined by intensity and duration) as the morphological filters used through the detection process are applied on the lidar volume depolarization ratio range corrected composite images, i.e. heavy rain events are unusable as the lidar signal is completely extinguished after few meters in the precipitation or no signal detected because of the water accumulated on the receiver optics."

VIIRS has 22 bands, among which 14 are reflective solar bands (RSBs) covering a spectral range from 0.41 to 2.25 μm. The RSBs are calibrated on-orbit using an onboard solar diffuser (SD), on-orbit degradation of which is tracked by an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM). NOAA-20 VIIRS is also scheduled to view the Moon approximately monthly and the lunar observations are used to track the RSB on-orbit changes as well. Both SD and lunar calibration results for the RSBs are shown and it is demonstrated that the two sets of the calibration coefficients diverge with time, especially at short wavelengths. The divergence is due to the non-uniformity of the SD degradation, which results in a long-term bias in the calibration coefficients derived from the SD calibration. A hybrid method, which properly combines the SD and lunar calibration results, is applied to generate the RSB calibration coefficients as has been done for SNPP VIIRS RSBs. The hybrid results have both the accuracy and frequency and ensure the high quality of the VIIRS sensor data records (SDR)."

This information includes water area, elevation, and storage; evaporation rate and volume values; and other characteristics. However, operational wall-to-wall reservoir storage and evaporation monitoring information is lacking on a global scale. Here we introduce NASA’s new MODIS/VIIRS Global Water Reservoir product suite based on moderate resolution remote sensing data—the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This product consists of 8-day (MxD28C2 and VNP28C2) and monthly (MxD28C3 and VNP28C3) measurements for 164 large reservoirs (MxD stands for the product from both Terra (MOD) or Aqua (MYD) satellites). The 8-day product provides area, elevation, and storage values, which were generated by first extracting water areas from surface reflectance data and then applying the area estimations to the pre-established Area–Elevation (A–E) relationships. These values were then further aggregated to monthly, with the evaporation rate and volume information added. The evaporation rate and volume values were calculated after the Lake Temperature and Evaporation Model (LTEM) using MODIS/VIIRS land surface temperature product and meteorological data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Validation results show that the 250 m area classifications from MODIS agree well with the high-resolution classifications from Landsat (R^(2) = 0.99). Validation of elevation and storage products for twelve Indian reservoirs show good agreement in terms of R^(2) values (0.71–0.96 for elevation, and 0.79–0.96 for storage) and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) values (5.08–19.34% for elevation, and 6.39–18.77% for storage). The evaporation rate results for two reservoirs (Lake Nasser and Lake Mead) agree well with in situ measurements (R^(2) values of 0.61 and 0.66, and NRMSE values of 16.25% and 21.76%). Furthermore, preliminary results from the VIIRS reservoir product have shown good consistency with the MODIS based product, confirming the continuity of this 20-year product suite. This new global water reservoir product suite can provide valuable information with regard to water-sources-related studies, applications, management, and hydrological modeling and change analysis such as drought monitoring."

Over the same period, a broad range of science and user communities has become increasingly dependent on the precipitation products provided by these sensors. The constellation presently consists of both conical and cross-track scanning precipitation-capable multi-channel instruments, many of which are beyond their operational and design lifetime but continue to operate through the cooperation of the responsible agencies. The Group on Earth Observations and the Coordinating Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS), among other groups, have raised the issue of how a robust, future precipitation constellation should be constructed. The key issues of current and future requirements for the mapping of global precipitation from satellite sensors can be summarised as providing: 1) sufficiently fine spatial resolutions to capture precipitation-scale systems and reduce the beam-filling effects of the observations; 2) a wide channel diversity for each sensor to cover the range of precipitation types, characteristics and intensities observed across the globe; 3) an observation interval that provides temporal sampling commensurate with the variability of precipitation; and 4) precipitation radars and radiometers in low inclination orbit to provide a consistent calibration source, as demonstrated by the first two spaceborne radar/radiometer combinations on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Core Observatory (CO). These issues are critical in determining the direction of future constellation requirements, while preserving the continuity of the existing constellation necessary for long-term climate-scale studies."

Unfortunately, the DT often fails to retrieve during the heaviest aerosol events as well as the more moderate events  in winter. Some of  the literature at-tributes  this  lack  of  retrieval  to  the  cloud  mask.  However, we found this lack of retrieval is mainly traced to thresholds used for masking of inland water and snow. Modifications to these two masks greatly increase 50 % of the retrievals of aerosol optical depth at 0.55 μm (AOD) greater than 1.0. The “extra”-high-AOD  retrievals  tend  to  be  biased  when  com-pared with a ground-based sun photometer (AErosol RObotic NETwork, AERONET). Reducing bias in new retrievals re-quires two additional steps. One is an update to the assumed aerosol optical properties (aerosol model); the haze in this region is both less absorbing and lower in altitude than what is assumed in the global algorithm. The second is account-ing for the scale height of the aerosol, specifically that the heavy-aerosol events in the region are much closer to the surface than what is assumed by the global DT algorithm. The resulting combination of modified masking thresholds, new aerosol model, and lower aerosol layer scale height was applied to 3 months of MODIS observations (January–March2013) over eastern China. After these two additional steps are  implemented,  the  significant  increase  in  new  retrievals introduces  no  overall  bias  at  a  high-AOD  regime  but  does degrade other overall validation statistics. We also find that the  research  algorithm  is  able  to  identify  additional  pollution events that AERONET instruments may not due to different  spatial  sampling.  Mean  AOD  retrieved  from  the  re-search  algorithm  increases  from  0.11  to  0.18  compared  to values calculated from the operational DT algorithm during January to March of 2013 over the study area. But near Beijing, where the severe pollution occurs, the new algorithm increases AOD by as much as 3.0 for each 0.5°grid box over the previous operational-algorithm values."

Regulation of this industry has varied over time and while industrial mining is prevalent in the country, the expansion of artisanal mining, or Galamsey has escalated in recent years. Many of these artisanal mines are not only harmful to human health due to the use of Mercury (Hg) in the amalgamation process, but also leave a significant footprint on terrestrial ecosystems, degrading and destroying forested ecosystems in the region. In this study, the Landsat image archive available through Google Earth Engine was used to quantify the total footprint of vegetation loss due to artisanal goldmines in Ghana from 2005 to 2019 and understand how conversion of forested regions to mining has changed over a decadal period from 2007 to 2017. A combination of machine learning and change detection algorithms were used to calculate different land cover conversions and the timing of conversion annually. Within the study area of southwestern Ghana, our results indicate that approximately 47,000 ha (⨦2218 ha) of vegetation were converted to mining at an average rate of ~2600 ha yr−1. The results indicate that a high percentage(~50%) of this mining occurred between 2014 and 2017. Around 700 ha of this mining occurred within protected areas as mapped by the World Database of Protected Areas. In addition to deforestation, increased artisanal mining activity in recent years has the potential to affect human health, access to drinking water resources and food security. This work expands upon limited research into the spatial footprint of Galamseyin Ghana, complements mapping efforts by local geographers, and will support efforts by the government of Ghana to monitor deforestation caused by artisanal mining."

A single grid element serves to both generate a projected source grid onto a retroreflective background, and to act as the cutoff grid for  the  reflected  light.   This  is  made  possible  by  manipulating the polarization of the light through the system.  The use of only a single grid element eliminates the need to create a cutoff grid that is perfectly matched and scaled to the source grid, and removes the need to align the source and cutoff grids to each other. The sensitivity to density objects is adjustable with the use of a polarizing prism.  Images obtained with this system show  similar  operation  to  existing  focusing  Schlieren systems, but with much reduced complexity and setup time.   Images taken with acrylic windows placed nor-mal to the optical axis further demonstrate the system’s utility for wind tunnel measurements."

Initially, the samples were assumed to be insulators and the complex permittivities were measured from data collected by sandwiching each sample between two conductors to form a sandwich. However, the AVCOAT sample data showed that the material becomes conductive as it begins to char. To get an accurate conductivity reading on these charred samples, a four-point resistance probe was used to collect data. Overall, this testing showed that the virgin AVCOAT starts out as a material that is a good insulator but transitions to one with a conductivity on the order of 1860 S/m as it chars. The deeper layers of AVCOAT (un-charred) all exhibited a temperature and frequency dependence that is possibly indicative of a dielectric relaxation in the material. As the sample temperatures were increased, a knee appears in the real permittivity data sets below 1 kHz. Both the real permittivity and resistivity drop up to several orders of magnitude yet show that the material remains an insulator.

The Shuttle High Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI) tile coatings studied included Reac- tion Cured Glass (RCG), Aluminum Enhanced Thermal Barrier (AETB), and Toughened Unipiece Fibrous Insulation (TUFI). The purely glass fiber parts of the tile were removed leaving only the outer layers con- taining just the coating. The data collected shows that the RCG, AETB, and outermost layer of the TUFI have similar electrical properties. The real permittivity plots show that there appears to be a relaxation that shows up at frequencies below 1 kHz. The relaxation frequency increases with increasing temperature. Also, the real permittivity increases up to about a factor of four between room temperature and 650K. Likewise, the resistivity (related to the imaginary permittivity) decreases up to five orders of magnitude over the same temperature interval, but still remains an insulator.

This data was collected to support a NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) assessment team investigating the source of thermocouple anomalies in both Shuttle TPS material and AVCOAT used for on the Orion spacecraft for Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1). The details of their findings will be documented in a separate report with this document serving as a reference."

Most galaxies that have been observed show a precipitous drop in the flux blueward of their Lyman limit. However, recent observations of EELGs have discovered that many more Lyman continuum photons escape from them into intergalactic space than previously suspected. We calculate their contribution to the extragalactic background light. We also calculate the effect of these photons on the absorption of high-energyγ-rays. For the more distantγ-ray sources, particularly at z >/ 3, an intergalactic opacity above a few GeV is significantly higher than previous estimates which ignored the Lyman continuum photons. We calculate the results of this increased opacity onobservedγ-ray spectra, which produce a high-energy turnover starting at lower energies than previously thought, and a gradual spectral steepening that may also be observable."

The research identified tasks that will be conducted by human crew during an expedition to Mars, and the abilities, skills, and knowledge that will be required of crew members.

The 3-year study uses research methods that were developed to analyze the work performed by a variety of civilian and military occupational specialties and is consistent with Human Factors methods. The work began by developing a comprehensive inventory of 1,125 tasks that are likely to be performed during the 12 phases of the first human expeditions to Mars, from launch to landing 30 months later. Sixty subject matter experts (SMEs) rated expedition tasks in terms of (likely) frequency of performance, difficulty to learn, and importance to mission success; a fourth metric (criticality), was derived by summing the mean ratings of the three dimensions. Seventy-two SMEs placed the physical, cognitive, and social abilities necessary to perform the tasks in order of importance for specialist domains identified by the task analysis. The research team then identified: 1) Abilities, skills, and knowledge that can be retained and generalized across tasks and 2) Implications for crew size and composition. Study results also led to recommendations concerning equipment, habitats, and procedures for exploration-class space missions.
Note: The full-mission task inventory was developed during a comprehensive review of documentation and concepts of operations. It was understood by the study team that the tasks were based on currently available information, and that the tools, equipment, propulsion methods, and/or other aspects of actual human expeditions to Mars might be different from those described here, as a consequence of technological development and evolving Mars Design Reference Missions.

The purpose and scope of this technical manual is to present the core, actionable information that resulted from this research. The abridged format is intended to address the needs of development and research teams to quickly access, discern, and use the information in the course of their exploration-related work."

To ensure that this type of autonomy is feasible, one of the critical steps from a safety and efficiency perspective is understanding various factors that affect the spatial separation between airborne flights and ensure that these factors can be managed. In terms of separation assurance and scheduling, an important real-world concern is that future states of aircraft cannot be perfectly predicted. The focus of this research paper is to understand how these prediction errors affect separation and scheduling services and to explore mitigation strategies to handle these errors. In this research, we have simulated these types of uncertainty by adding wind-prediction errors to trajectory predictions for separation. With these wind-prediction errors, we decompose the problem into two separate questions. First, using both simulation and analytical methods, we look at conflict-detection-only scenarios to understand how the wind errors affect required minimum temporal separation between crossing flights to ensure a specific spatial separation. Next, we study how trajectory errors effect conflict resolution, and we explore different combinations of scheduling and separation assurance to mitigate the effects of uncertainty between crossing flights. The conflict resolution algorithm aims to minimize necessary temporal separation between crossing flights under uncertainty, still ensuring safety-critical spatial separation. In summary, this research suggests that the required minimum temporal separation at a crossing waypoint is dependent on factors such as inbound crossing angle, the relative angle between wind direction and bearing of each route, wind magnitude, wind magnitude uncertainty, nominal cruise airspeed of aircraft, and look-ahead time of the conflict detection algorithm. This research also suggests that different combinations of scheduling and separation have different qualitative results. Using a combination of strategic, flow-based scheduling, tactical scheduling at crossings, speed control near crossing points, and separation management leads to a system that is insensitive to trajectory prediction errors with high throughput and flexibility for aircraft away from shared resources."

The next phase of experiments will involve an NACA 0015-based swept wing, as prior risk reduction experiments had indicated that this wing shape resulted in reduced separation near the juncture region than the DLR-F6 wing, thus providing a better option to evaluate the ability of CFD models to predict incipient turbulent separation. The NACA 0015 measurements will also include IR thermography to infer the variation of transition front with respect to an increasing angle of attack. The primary objective of this work is to computationally make a preliminary assessment of the transition front on both surfaces of the NACA 0015 wing at a crank-chord-based Reynolds number of 2.4 x 106 for four different angles of attack, (0°, 2.5°, 5°, and 7.5°) and to determine the dominant mechanisms responsible for transition. This assessment includes both RANS-based transition models from NASA’s OVERFLOW 2.3b flow solver and linear parabolized stability equations (PSE) stability analysis based on the Langley Stability and Transition Analysis code, LASTRAC. Linear PSE results indicate that the upper surface of the wing is dominated by Tollmien- Schlichting (TS) instabilities, and that the laminar flow region shrinks from about 50% chord to a very small region just downstream of the attachment line as the angle of attack is increased from 0° to 7.5°. Consequently, the transition fronts predicted by the Spalart- Allmaras-based amplification factor transport (AFT-2017b) equation model (which accounts for the TS instabilities alone) and the Menter’s shear-stress transport equation (SST2003)- based Langtry-Menter transition model with ability to account for both TS and crossflow effects (LM2015) compare well with those predicted using linear PSE. On the lower surface of the wing, stationary crossflow (CF) instabilities begin to appear on the inboard portion of the wing in addition to the TS-instabilities for the larger angles of attack (5° and 7.5°), further reducing the laminar flow extent within the inboard region. The LM2015 model that accounts for CF effects is able to replicate this trend but appears to predict a slightly earlier transition. The outcome of this effort will inform the experiment and, when the actual experimental data become available, provide further opportunity to assess and improve the various transition models."

To support this trend, they will digitally share copious amounts of information via a common communication architecture. Operators will deploy programs that create and negotiate flight plans via the architecture’s communication protocols. These programs will autonomously make decisions that must be arbitrated by the architecture and robust to uncertainty. To study interoperability in air traffic management, a new airspace simulation system was composed by integrating a legacy airspace simulation, an air traffic control model, and a new research communication architecture. It was used to evaluate air traffic management concepts by adapting it to handle congested arrival traffic at Newark Liberty International Airport and executing simulations. Results demonstrated the ability of the simulation system to model in detail strategic traffic flow management, predeparture flight planning, and air traffic control working in concert. Subsequent studies can use the simulation system to study interoperability, autonomy, digital communication, and uncertainty in future air traffic management systems."

Here we present the initial results of electron microprobe and X-ray computed tomography (XCT) studies of these stones and look at the details of their petrography and mineral chemistry, as well as investigate possible pairing relationships, both with each other and with previously described lunar meteorites. Most of the work presented here is on the DOM 18509, 18543, and 18678 stones; subsamples of the other stones are in hand and similar measurements will be made on them by the time of the meeting.

Methods: Textures in DOM 18509, DOM 18543, and DOM 18678 were characterized in 2D by optical microscopy, backscattered electron (BSE) imaging and elemental X-ray images on thin sections, as well as in 3D by X-ray computed tomography (XCT) on sample chips. Mineral compositions were assessed through a combination of wavelength dispersive spectroscopy EPMA (electron probe microanalysis) and x-ray mapping on the JEOL 8530 at NASA
JSC. The bulk composition of all three meteorites was determined based on analyses of the fusion crust glass. XCT analyses were done on the Nikon XTH 320 at NASA JSC. ICP-MS data on bulk rock subsamples for each meteorite will be carried out in the near future.

Results: The stones are all similar in macroscopic appearance with a dark aphanitic matrix hosting a variety of small- to medium-sized angular mineral and lithic fragments (often light colored in nature) [1,2]. Based on EPMA and XCT results, the three meteorites are polymict regolith breccias comprised of mineral, glass, and lithic clasts ranging up to several mm in length. Melt veins run through all three meteorite samples. Mineral clasts in all 3 stones are dominated by pyroxene and plagioclase (An82-96), with minor amounts of SiO2, olivine (Fo1-52), and FeTi-oxides. Pyroxene grains are mostly Fe-rich pigeonite and augite, and larger clasts are normally zoned and have fine exsolution lamellae. The lithic clasts in all stones consists of: (1) basalt clasts that contain zoned pyroxene, plagioclase laths, and ilmenite, with minor silica and Fe-rich olivine; (2) granulitic clasts; (3) anorthosite clasts; (4) Si-rich clasts that also contain ilmenite, troilite, high-Ca pyroxene, fayalite, and K-feldspar likely mesostasis from late stage basalts). All three meteorites contain glassy fusion crust that is highly vesicular, high in FeO and Al2O3 (15-17 wt% each), ferroan (Mg# of 23-24), and moderately rich in TiO2 (1.4-1.8 wt%). The composition of the fusion crust can serve as a proxy for the bulk meteorite composition and is identical within error for all three meteorites.

Implications: The lithic and mineral clasts in all three stones are similar in clast population and assemblages as well as mineral chemistry. In addition, the fusion crust composition, a proxy for bulk composition, is within error of each other for all three stones. Thus DOM 18509, DOM 18543, and DOM 18678 are almost certainly paired. Based on similarities in macroscopic description as well as preliminary classification data [1,2], all 7 lunar stones from DOM are likely paired, though additional quantitative analyses are needed to confirm this. The presence of spherules and vesicular fusion crusts indicates that the DOM pairing group is a regolith breccia. The presence of basaltic and gabbroic clasts as well as more feldspathic materials, suggest that the regolith from which these meteorites formed contained a mixture of feldspathic highland material and mare material, suggesting a possible provenance near a marehighlands boundary. No evidence of KREEPy lithologies have been observed so far in these meteorites, however, future ICP-MS data on bulk rock chips for the stones will reveal any KREEP component if present. The DOM pairing group has many similarities to previously described lunar breccia meteorite MET 01210, however more detailed compositional data will be needed to make a definitive comparison."

Since 2016, using a mechanism known as a Space Act Agreement, NASA Ames’ Fatigue Countermeasures Laboratory has worked with the American’s Fatigue Risk Management team to gather sleep and alertness data from volunteer flight crew members. Operations studied include long-range transpacific flights, timing of inflight rest breaks during augmented flights, and rates of acclimation related to flights making theater changes. This mutually beneficial collaborative working arrangement allows American to conduct operations of specific interest under the FAA’s Alternative Means of Compliance process and provides NASA with a means to gather and analyze data that can be used to inform operational safety-related decisions.
Earlier this year, results from the study of inflight rest breaks was published in the journal Aerospace Medicine and Human Performance. A total of 500 American pilots responded to a survey with landing crew reporting more and better-quality sleep during break 2 than break 3. Subsequent ratings of sleepiness and alertness at TOD were significantly better for crew who used break 2. Findings from this study were reported to the FAA leading to an inflight fatigue mitigation capability for many pilots in the industry.
An upcoming study is to evaluate workload and alertness levels during Caribbean Turn (DFW-SJO-DFW) operations. For this study, the FRMS team and NASA will ask volunteers to collect data on sleep, workload, performance, and alertness using scientifically valid methods The information gained in this study will help inform how workload and fatigue interact with duty duration during short-haul, daytime operations."

Because most approaches require one or more human operators at some level, it is important to explore the control and visualization interfaces available to those operators, taking into account the challenges due to significant telemetry time delay. We consider one motivating application of remote teleoperation, which is ground-based control of a robot on-orbit for satellite servicing. This paper presents a model-based architecture that: 1) improves visualization and situation awareness, 2) enables more effective human/robot interaction and control, and 3) detects task failures based on anomalous sensor feedback. We illustrate elements of the architecture by drawing on 10 years of our research in this area. The paper further reports the results of several multi-user experiments to evaluate the model-based architecture, on ground-based test platforms, for satellite servicing tasks subject to round-trip communication latencies of several seconds. The most significant performance gains were obtained by enhancing the operators’ situation awareness via improved visualization and by enabling them to precisely specify intended motion. In contrast, changes to the control interface, including model-mediated control or an immersive 3D environment, often reduced the reported task load but did not significantly improve task performance. Considering the challenges of fully autonomous intervention, we expect that some form of teleoperation will continue to be necessary for robotic in-situ servicing, assembly, and manufacturing tasks for the foreseeable future. We propose that effective teleoperation can be enabled by modeling the remote environment, providing operators with a fused view of the real environment and virtual model, and incorporating interfaces and control strategies that enable interactive planning, precise operation, and prompt detection of errors."

H2-O2 proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells can accommodate such requirements without significant current smoothing or additional devices to provide transient power. This testing involved current load step changes to characterize non-flow-through PEM fuel cell response to increasing and decreasing load step changes over a range of 0 to 0.5 A/sq. cm. It was determined that fuel cell output voltage stabilizes within 4 ms with no noticeable steady-state performance degradation, following exposure of the fuel cell to transient loads of up to ~1.5 A/sq. cm.

Throughout most of Africa, emissions of these gases are predominantly from soils and biomass burning. Here we use observations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) from 2005 through 2017 and atmospheric NH3 VCDs from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) from 2008 through 2017 to evaluate seasonal variation of NO2 and NH3 VCDs across Africa and in seven African ecoregions. In regions where mean annual precipitation (MAP) is under 500 mm/yr we find that NO2 and NH3 VCDs are positively related to monthly precipitation, and where MAP is between 500 and 1750 mm yr-1 or higher, NO2 VCDs are negatively related to monthly precipitation. In dry ecoregions, temperature and precipitation were important predictors of NH3 and NO2 VCDs, likely related to variation in soil emissions. In mesic ecoregions, monthly NO2 VCDs were strongly related to burned area, suggesting that biomass burning drives seasonality. NH3 VCDs in mesic ecoregions were positively related to both monthly temperature and monthly CO VCDs, suggesting that a mixture of soil and biomass burning emissions influenced NH3 seasonality. In northern mesic ecoregions monthly temperature explained most of the variance in monthly NH3 VCDs, suggesting that soil sources, including animal excreta, determined NH3 seasonality. In southern mesic ecoregions, monthly CO VCDs explained more variation in NH3 VCDs than temperature, suggesting that biomass burning may have greater influence over NH3 seasonality."

These impacts are mostly associated with the attenuation of visible sunlight by stratospheric sulfate aerosols, which causes cooling and deceleration of the water cycle. Supereruptions have been assumed to cause so-called volcanic winters that act as primary evolutionary factors through ecosystem disruption and famine, however, winter conditions alone may not be sufficient to cause such disruption. Here we use Earth system model simulations to show that stratospheric sulfur emissions from the Toba supereruption 74,000 years ago caused severe stratospheric ozone loss through a radiation attenuation mechanism that only moderately depends on the emission magnitude. The Toba plume strongly inhibited oxygen photolysis, suppressing ozone formation in the tropics, where exceptionally depleted ozone conditions persisted for over a year. This effect, when combined with volcanic winter in the extra-tropics, can account for the impacts of supereruptions on ecosystems and humanity."

a predictive understanding of the export, fate, and carbon cycle impacts of global ocean net primary
production. To accomplish this goal, observations of export flux pathways, plankton community
composition, food web processes, and optical, physical, and biogeochemical (BGC) properties are needed
over a range of ecosystem states. Here we introduce the first EXPORTS field deployment to Ocean Station
Papa in the Northeast Pacific Ocean during summer of 2018, providing context for other papers in this special
collection. The experiment was conducted with two ships: a Process Ship, focused on ecological rates, BGC
fluxes, temporal changes in food web, and BGC and optical properties, that followed an instrumented
Lagrangian float; and a Survey Ship that sampled BGC and optical properties in spatial patterns around the
Process Ship. An array of autonomous underwater assets provided measurements over a range of spatial and
temporal scales, and partnering programs and remote sensing observations provided additional observational
context. The oceanographic setting was typical of late-summer conditions at Ocean Station Papa: a shallow
mixed layer, strong vertical and weak horizontal gradients in hydrographic properties, sluggish sub-inertial
currents, elevated macronutrient concentrations and low phytoplankton abundances. Although nutrient
concentrations were consistent with previous observations, mixed layer chlorophyll was lower than
typically observed, resulting in a deeper euphotic zone. Analyses of surface layer temperature and salinity
found three distinct surface water types, allowing for diagnosis of whether observed changes were spatial or
temporal.The 2018 EXPORTS field deployment is among the most comprehensive biological pump studies ever
conducted. A second deployment to the North Atlantic Ocean occurred in spring 2021, which will be followed
by focused work on data synthesis and modeling using the entire EXPORTS data set."

Many high-altitude glaciers are monitored by ground observations, aerial photography, and satellite-borne sensors. Regardless of latitude and elevation, nearly all nonpolar glaciers and ice caps are undergoing mass loss, which compromises the records of past climate preserved within them. Almost without exception, the retreat of these ice fields is persistent, and a very important driver is the recent warming of the tropical troposphere and oceans. Here we present data on the decrease in the surface area of four glaciers from low- to mid-latitude mountainous regions: the Andes of Peru and northern Bolivia, equatorial east Africa, equatorial Papua, Indonesia, and the western Tibetan Plateau. Climate records based on oxygen isotopic ratios (δ18O) measured in ice cores drilled from several glaciers in these regions reveal that the records from elevations below ~6000 m above sea level have been substantially modified by seasonal melting and the movement of meltwater through porous upper firn layers. Fortunately, δ18O records recovered from higher altitude sites still contain well-preserved seasonal variations to the surface; however, the projected increase in the rate of atmospheric warming implies that climate records from higher elevation glaciers will eventually also be degraded. A long-term ice core collection program on the Quelccaya ice cap in Peru, Earth's largest tropical ice cap, illustrates that the deterioration of its climate record is concomitant with the increase in mid-troposphere temperatures. The melting ice and resulting growth of proglacial lakes presents an imminent hazard to nearby communities. The accelerating melting of glaciers, if sustained, ensures the eventual loss of unique and irreplaceable climate histories, as well as profound economic, agricultural, and cultural impacts on local communities."

auroral acceleration region (AAR). This region is the portion of an auroral field line with a field-aligned
electric field that leads to the formation of precipitating monoenergetic keV electron fluxes that produce
the discrete auroral displays observable from the ground. It is assumed that these precipitating electron
fluxes are monoenergetic and accelerated through a potential drop, V, such that these electrons are peaked
at an energy E0 = eV, where e is the electron charge. Monoenergetic electrons precipitating into the upper
atmosphere degrade to lower energies via many different collisional processes and produce the secondary
electron population with energies of 10–100s eV which escapes back to magnetospheric altitudes and
becomes geomagnetically trapped between the AAR and the upper ionosphere. The secondary electrons in
this geomagnetic trap transfer energy via elastic Coulomb collisions to the thermal electrons. That energy
is then returned to the topside ionosphere as heat flux carried by the electron thermal conduction which is
essential to maintaining the topside electron temperature."

(2017) using visible and panchromatic imaging acquired by the LOng-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) and the Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC). We have focused on 13 of the geologic units identified by White et al. (2017), which include the plains and mountain units contained within the Sputnik basin. We divided the map of Sputnik Planitia into 15 provinces, each containing one or more geologic units, and we use LEISA to calculate the average spectra of the units inside the 15 provinces. Hapke-based modeling was then applied to the average spectra of the units to infer their surface composition, and to determine if the composition resulting from the modeling of LEISA spectra reflects the geomorphologic analyses of LORRI data, and if areas classified as being the same geologically, but which are geographically separated, share a similar composition. We investigated the spatial distribution of the most abundant ices on Pluto’s surface - CH4, N2, CO, H2O, and a non-ice component presumed to be a macromolecular carbon-rich material, termed a tholin, that imparts a positive spectral slope in the visible spectral region and a negative spectral slope longward of ~1.1 μm. Because the exact nature of the non-ice component is still debated and because the negative spectral slope of the available tholins in the near infrared does not perfectly match the Pluto data, for spectral modeling purposes we reference it generically as the negative spectral slope endmember (NSS endmember). We created maps of variations in the integrated band depth (from LEISA data) and areal mass fraction (from the modeling) of the components. The analysis of correlations between the occurrences of the endmembers in the geologic units led to the observation of an anomalous suppression of the strong CH4 absorption bands in units with compositions that are dominated by H2O ice and the NSS endmember. Exploring the mutual variation of the CH4 and N2 integrated band depths with the abundance of crystalline H2O and NSS endmember revealed that the NSS endmember is primarily responsible for the suppression of CH4 absorptions in mountainous units located along the western edge of Sputnik Planitia. Our spectroscopic analyses have provided additional insight into the geological processes that have shaped Sputnik Planitia. A general increase in volatile abundance from the north to the south of Sputnik Planitia is observed. Such an increase first observed and interpreted by Protopapa et al., 2017 and later confirmed by climate modeling (Bertrand et al., 2018) is expressed geomorphologically in the form of preferential deposition of N2 ice in the upland and mountainous regions bordering the plains of southern Sputnik Planitia. Relatively high amounts of pure CH4 are seen at the southern Tenzing Montes, which are a natural site for CH4 deposition owing to their great elevation and the lower insolation they are presently receiving. The NSS endmember correlates the existence of tholins within certain units, mostly those coating the low-latitude mountain ranges that are co-latitudinal with the tholin-covered Cthulhu Macula. The spectral analysis has also revealed compositional differences between the handful of occurrences of northern non-cellular plains and the surrounding cellular plains, all of which are located within the portion of Sputnik Planitia that is presently experiencing net sublimation of volatiles, and which do not therefore exhibit a surface layer of bright, freshly-deposited N2 ice. The compositional differences between the cellular and non-cellular plains here hint at the effectiveness of convection in entraining and trapping tholins within the body of the cellular plains, while preventing the spread of such tholins to abutting non-cellular plains."

While GRACE Level-2 spherical harmonic products require various post-processing techniques to eliminate correlated noise, mascon formulations employ spatial regularization strategies during the estimation step to improve signal recovery. However, mascon estimation has traditionally required large computing resources and GRACE Level-1B processing capabilities. In this study, we show that a typical mascon estimation system can be reformulated to allow for the estimation of regularized mascons from Level-2 spherical harmonics. Provided that spherical harmonic solution covariances are available, the computed mascons will be mathematically equivalent to similar mascons estimated from Level-1B observations. This method is computationally efficient, better leverages GRACE spherical harmonics than past methods, and matches the performance of typical mascon solutions without locking scientists into pre-determined regularization designs. We develop a proof-of-concept solution using ITSG-Grace2018 and compare results with traditional mascons from JPL and NASA GSFC. We then assess the effects of spherical harmonic truncation and use of regularization correlations on basin signal recovery. We find that spherical expansions to degree and order 60 provide the minimum expansion necessary to study most basins, while larger expansions help further localize signals. We also find that diagonal regularizations (i.e., regularizations that do not contain inter-mascon correlations) are adversely affected by leakage, especially across boundaries such as coastlines where signals are not highly correlated, whereas including inter-mascon correlations and regional boundaries in the regularization greatly improves signal recovery."

One of the most important SW drivers is the solar wind dynamic pressure, and most significantly its sharp changes known as pressure fronts. Sudden enhancements in solar wind dynamic pressure, SWP, have been shown to lead to intensification of the auroral electrojets (and Region 1 field-aligned currents), increase in auroral emissions, and significant enhancement in ionospheric convection and the transpolar potential. Case studies of the interaction between pressure fronts and the terrestrial space environment shed great light on their importance to the structure and dynamics of the system. However, thorough understanding of the interaction requires fully statistical investigations. These statistical studies require a large number of suitable pressure front events. In the past these have been obtained through laborious manual inspection of solar wind data. We present an automated procedure that identifies sudden step enhancements in SWP that satisfy a desired set of limiting step-like characteristics, such as magnitude of the change, sign of the change (positive/negative), and rate of change. The procedure yields a list of suitable events, along with their step features within minutes. The technique is tested for missed events and false positives by direct comparison to manual inspection of the data. Its utility is illustrated by application to the statistical effect of pressure fronts to the transpolar potential as measured by the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) technique."

In this paper, the problem is recast as a discrete-time nonlinear system.  and viewed in a new light from the perspective of nonlinear systems and feedback control theory.  In particular, connections are made between the Collatz sequence of numbers and the behavior of closed-loop dynamical systems designed using a feedback control method called sliding mode control.  Trajectories of such systems are characterized by a reaching phase and a sliding phase, the latter of which exhibits exponential convergence.  As sliding mode control design is rooted in Lyapunov stability theory, the analogy suggests a new direction for proving or disproving the Collatz Conjecture.  Although several possible approaches are discussed, no formal proof is given in this paper."

The X-59's low-boom level will depend on aircraft conditions and trajectory, which can be controlled, and on atmospheric conditions, which cannot be controlled. To assess variability in low-boom levels produced by realistic atmospheres, NASA's PCBoom code was used to simulate propagation of an X-59 nearfield pressure condition through atmospheric profiles measured during NASA's Quiet Supersonic Flights 2018 (QSF18) test. Despite QSF18 lasting only 11 days, substantial weather variability occurred including snow and record high temperatures. A PL range of about 8.5 dB was predicted due to the QSF18 atmospheric variability. These results demonstrate the necessity for X-59's flight condition to be adjusted based on atmospheric conditions in order to achieve desired loudness levels during community surveys. Undertrack booms' Perceived Levels (PL) were predicted not to exceed 75 dB, X-59's target level in a standard atmosphere. Attenuation rate, ray tube area, path length, and other quantities are presented throughout propagation for the atmospheres that produce the loudest and quietest booms. Humidity differences below 15kft were a primary driver of the PL differences."

The test matrix of nozzles included 15 different chevron nozzle designs and one baseline, circularly symmetric nozzle.  Nozzle jet operating conditions ranged from acoustic Mach numbers of 0.9 to 1.5, with static temperature ratios ranging between 0.84 and 2.7. Detailed surveys of the single jet flows were performed to capture three-dimensional features of the turbulent exhaust jet evolution. Cross-flow planar measurements were obtained at twelve axial locations, ranging from 0.1 to 20 nozzle diameters downstream of the nozzle exit planes. Streamwise measurements, along the jet centerlines, were obtained at ten partially overlapping downstream locations, providing complete axial surveys over a region extending beyond 20 nozzle diameters downstream of the nozzle exit planes. In both optical configurations, the measurement planes were sized to completely capture the fully turbulent jet shear layer growth. The measured three-dimensional mean and turbulent velocity fields, along with computed second order statistics including axial vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy, were evaluated for all test points.

A laser heterodyne radiometer is similar in design to the super heterodyne radio receiver that is well known by ham radio enthusiasts. While not previously a commercial technique, laser heterodyne radiometers have a history of measuring atmospheric trace gases that started in the 1960s. With the commercial availability of inexpensive, low-power, thumbnail-sized lasers developed for the telecommunications industry, it was possible to miniaturize this technique and ultimately commercialize it. The mini-LHR has been under development at NASA GSFC since 2009. During that time, in addition to signicant technical improvements, processing has also evolved and been streamlined. Here we present details of the processing approach for raw mini-LHR data to produce 30- and 60-minute data products of CH and CO column mole fractions. Processing occurs in two general stages: a python-based pre-processing of raw data, followed by ingestion into a Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) retrieval algorithm. Raw data processing involves removal of outliers, correcting for changes in air mass throughout the day, averaging scans, and ultimately converting averaged scans into transmittance vs. wavelength. The PSG retrieval simulates a spectra for the time/day/location of the scan with meteorological inputs from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) data set and then perturbs the concentrations of CO and CH to obtain a t based on an iterative least-squares curve fitting procedure."

The study is conducted over a region in Western Colorado using a suite of observing system simulation experiments(OSSEs).The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator, version 5.0 (JULES v5.0) is employed to simulate a suite of idealized LiDAR observations, considering a range of LiDAR snow depth retrieval errors, different hypothetical sensor swath widths, and the impact of cloud cover on observability. These simulated observations are then assimilated into the Noah land surface modelwith multi-parameterization options, version 3.6 (Noah-MP v3.6) model. This data assimilation setup is used to systematically evaluate the potential utility of LiDAR observations for improving modeled snow water equivalent (SWE)estimates and water budget variables such as runoff. Results from the OSSE runsshow that, in general, assimilation of synthetic LiDAR observations provide beneficial impacts when theLiDAR snow depth retrieval error standard deviation (σerror) is below 60 cm.Based on comparisons between the realistic (i.e., swath-limited and cloud-attenuated) case and the idealized (i.e., infinite swath width in the absence of cloud cover) case,this study concludes that observations with a conservative error standard deviation threshold of 40 cm (i.e., upper limit of the snow depth retrieval error that adds value to the SWE estimates viaassimilation) are needed for improving modeled snow estimates. More than a 33% reduction in SWEroot mean square errors and more than a 15% increase in correlation coefficientsare achieved when σ error ≤ 40 cmusing a 170-km sensor swath width in the presence of cloud attenuation effects. Further, the integrated hydrologic response, as represented by total (surface and subsurface) runoff estimates during the snow ablation season, are also enhanced when assimilating synthetic LiDAR snow depth retrievals with errors below this level."

We also repeated our quantification of northern peat carbon stocks using only radiocarbon data vetted by other publications. However, our conclusions are unchanged by the elimination of the additional data.

We find that while the mean values for carbon stock differ by twofold, the uncertainties around those means are larger than previously acknowledged and are overlapping. This result emphasizes the need for continued work by the carbon cycle science community to understand and quantify uncertainty in terrestrial carbon stock estimates."

The parameterization has been expanded to atrimodal spectral size to simulate three convection modes: shallow, congestus and deep.

In this study, we investigate the impact of frozen hydrometeors on these transitions. We focus on a CAO case in the NW Atlantic, the location of the multi-year flight campaign ACTIVATE (Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment). We use MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2) reanalysis fields to drive large eddy simulations with mixed-phase two-moment microphysics in a Lagrangian framework. We find that transitions are triggered by substantial rain (rainwater paths >25 g m−2), and only simulations that allow for aerosol depletion result in sustained breakups, as observed. Using a range of diagnostic ice nucleating particle concentrations, Ninp, we find that increasing ice progressively accelerates transitions, thus abbreviating the overcast state. Ice particles affect the cloud-topped boundary layer evolution, primarily through riming-related processes prior to substantial rain, leading to (1) a reduction in cloud liquid water, (2) early consumption of cloud condensation nuclei, and (3) early and light precipitation cooling and moistening below cloud. We refer to these three effects collectively as “preconditioning by riming”. Greater boundary layer aerosol concentrations available as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) delay the onset of substantial rain. However, cloud breakup and low CCN concentration final stages are found to be inevitable in this case, due, primarily, to liquid water path buildup. An ice-modulated cloud transition speed suggests the possibility of a negative cloud–climate feedback. To address prevailing uncertainties in the model representation of mixed-phase processes, the magnitude of ice formation and riming impacts and, thereby, the strength of an associated negative cloud–climate feedback process, requires further observational evaluation by targeting riming hot spots with in situ imaging probes that allow for both the characterization of ice particles and abundance of supercooled droplets."

The seasonal bias in Rrs(λ) is present to 
varying degrees in all ocean color satellites examined, including VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor), and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer). The relative bias in Rrs has spectral dependence. Products derived from Rrs(λ) are affected by the bias to varying degrees, with particulate backscattering varying up to 50% over a year, chlorophyll varying up to 25% over a year, and absorption from phytoplankton or dissolved material varying by up to 15%. The propagation of Rrs(λ) bias into derived products is broadly confirmed on regional and global scales using Argo floats and data from the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) instrument aboard the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder) satellite. The artifactual seasonality in ocean color is prominent in areas of low biomass 
(i.e., subtropical gyres) and is not easily discerned in areas of high biomass. While we have eliminated several candidates that could cause the biases in Rrs(λ), there are still outstanding questions regarding potential contributions from atmospheric corrections. Specifically, we provide evidence that the aquatic bidirectional reflectance distribution function may in part cause the observed seasonal bias, but this does not preclude an additional effect of the aerosol estimation. Our investigation highlights the contributions that atmospheric correction schemes can make in introducing biases in Rrs (λ) and we recommend more simulations to discern these influence Rrs (λ) biases. Community efforts are needed to find the root cause of the seasonal bias because all past, present, and future data are or will be affected until a solution is implemented."

We concentrate on using a robotic arm to grapple a free-floating spacecraft, as distinct from spacecraft docking and berthing, where two spacecraft directly mate with each other. Robotic grappling of client spacecraft is a deceptively complex problem: It entails designing a robotic system that functions robustly in the visually stark, thermally extreme orbital environment,operating near massive and extremely expensive yet fragile client hardware,using relatively slow flight computers with limited and laggy communica-tions. Spaceflight robotic systems are challenging to test and validate priorto deployment and extremely expensive to launch, which significantly limitsopportunities to experiment with new techniques.

Nevertheless, there is increas-ing interest in on-orbit robotic servicing and assembly missions, and grap-pling is the core requirement for these systems. Although existing systemssuch as the Space Station Remote Manipulator System have demonstratedextremely reliable operation, upcoming missions will attempt to expand thetypes of spacecraft that can be safely and dependably grappled and berthed."

We evaluate the sensitivities to dark matter thermally averaged annihilation cross section〈σv〉and partial decay width into neutrinosΓχ→ν ̄ν(in the mass scale107≤mχ/GeV≤1015) for next generation observatories like POEMMA and GRAND. We show that in the range107≤mχ/GeV≤1011, space-based Cherenkov detectors like POEMMA have the advantage of full-sky coverage and rapid slewing, enabling an optimized dark matter observation strategy focusing on the Galactic center. We also show that ground-based radio detectors such as GRAND can achieve high sensitivities and high duty cycles in radio quiet areas. We compare the sensitivities of next generation neutrino experiments with existing constraints from IceCube and updated 90% C.L. upper limits on〈σv〉andΓχ→ν ̄νusing results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration and ANITA. We show that in the range 107≤mχ/GeV≤1011POEMMA and GRAND10k will improve the neutrino sensitivity to particle dark matter by factors of 2 to 10 over existing limits, whereas GRAND200kwill improve this sensitivity by two orders of magnitude. In the range 1011≤mχ/GeV≤1015, POEMMA’s fluorescence observation mode will achieve an unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter properties. Finally, we highlight the importance of the uncertainties related to the dark matter distribution in the Galactic halo, using the latest fit and estimates of the Galactic parameters."

However there has been little focus on sub-Saharan Africa, as few African cities have air quality monitors and if they do, these data are often not publicly available. Spatial differentials of changes in PM(sub 2.5) concentrations as a result of COVID also remain largely unstudied. To address this gap, we use a serendipitous mobile air quality monitoring deployment of eight Sensirion SPS 30 sensors on motorbikes in the city of Nairobi starting on 16 March 2020, before a COVID-19 curfew was imposed on 25 March and continuing until 5 May 2020. We developed a random-forest model to estimate
PM(sub 2.5) surfaces for the entire city of Nairobi before and during the COVID-19 curfew. The highest PM(sub 2.5) concentrations during both periods were observed in the poor neighborhoods of Kariobangi, Mathare, Umoja, and Dandora, located to the east of the city center. Changes in PM(sub 2.5) were heterogeneous over space. PM(sub 2.5) concentrations increased during the curfew in rapidly urbanizing, the lower-middle-class neighborhoods of Kahawa, Kasarani, and Ruaraka, likely because residents switched from LPG to biomass fuels due to loss of income. Our results indicate that COVID-19 and policies to address it may have exacerbated existing air pollution inequalities in the city of Nairobi. The quantitative results are preliminary, due to sampling limitations and measurement uncertainties, as the available data came exclusively from low-cost sensors. This research serves to highlight that spatial data that is essential for understanding structural inequalities reflected in uneven air pollution burdens and differential impacts of events like the COVID pandemic. With the help of carefully deployed low cost sensors with improved spatial sampling and at least one reference-quality monitor for calibration, we can collect data that is critical for developing targeted interventions that address environmental injustice in the African context."

These models are often categorized into empirical, semi-empirical or volumetric based on their methodologies and input data requirements. To study in detail, the comparative performance of four dielectric mixing models -- Wang & Schmugge model, Hallikainen model, Dobson model and Mironov model were used with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band brightness temperature and Single Channel Algorithm for SM retrieval over agricultural landscapes in India. The highest performance statistics combination in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R^(2)) and percentage bias (PBIAS) against the concurrent in-situ SM measurements were calculated at the selected validation sites. The overall results indicate that the best performance was given by the Mironov model (RMSE = 0.07 cu. m/cu. m), followed by Wang & Schmugge model (RMSE = 0.08 cu. m3/cu. m), Hallikainen model (RMSE = 0.09 cu. m/cu. m), Dobson model (RMSE = 0.10 cu. m/cu. m) and original SMAP radiometer SM (RMSE = 0.12 cu. m/cu. m). Findings of this study provides important insights into application and performance of dielectric mixing models in mapping surface SM variations. This study also underlines the pivotal role of local conditions for SM retrieval which should be carefully included in the algorithms."

This enhanced MLI is part of Orion’s propulsion subsystem, and it is planned to replace a double-layer Kevlar® configuration starting at the Artemis IV mission. This effort has included fifty-two shield characterization shots for five different shield configurations over the four Orion propellant storage vessels. These storage vessels are located in the European Service Module (ESM). This shield characterization has been managed by the Hypervelocity Impact Technology (HVIT) group in NASA Astromaterials Research and Exploration Sciences at Johnson Space Center (JSC) for the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) and the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) program office in coordination with Lockheed Martin Space and Thales Alenia Space-Italy (TAS-I). The shield characterization has used the two-stage, light-gas-gun at the Remote Hypervelocity Test Laboratory (RHTL) of NASA JSC White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) for acceleration of projectiles to representative orbital impact speeds. From this shield characterization effort, a revised ballistic limiting equation (BLE) has been developed for each of the five representative shielding configurations of the ESM pressure vessels. This document provides a brief description of the shield configurations considered for the Orion program and the shield  characterization  findings.  These  results  are  compared  to  the  assumed  BLE  for  each configuration going into the Artemis missions that utilize this version of ballistic enhanced MLI. The models are integrated into a fourteen day High Lunar Orbit (HLO) mission as a representative reliability prediction impact for Orion, and it has been found that the predicted risk of a loss-of-crew (LOC) event is actually a little less than half of the assumed value that launched this design modification opportunity."

Full nonlinear rigid-body rotational equations of motion were used in the analysis, with aerodynamic moment dependencies modeled by linear expansions in the aircraft states and controls. Aerodynamic parameters were estimated simultaneously with inertia parameters using equation-error modeling applied to flight test data from maneuvers designed specifically for this problem. The approach was demonstrated using a nonlinear F 16 simulation, then applied to a remotely-piloted subscale aircraft flight test. Errors in the aircraft moment of inertia parameters determined from simulated F-16 flight test data were less than 6 percent compared to the true values in the simulation. Flight test results for the subscale aircraft were within 6 percent of ground-test values obtained using the same aircraft."

The PBL Height (PBLH) is an important parameter in climate models, weather forecasts, and air quality prediction.  The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) provides data processing, archiving, and distribution services for numerous Earth science products. PBLH is a parameter in three products served by GES DISC, which are from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), the Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) experiment, and the NASA reanalysis product Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications – 2 (MERRA-2). These products have different spatial and temporal resolutions and coverages, and their PBLH definitions are also different. To better serve the PBL research community, we have summarized the specifications of these products. A ten-year seasonal mean intercomparison is also conducted to provide further guidance to users. The intercomparison results show that MERRA-2 has a much shallower PBL than AIRS and GPS RO. An experimental study indicates the different PBLH definition in MERRA-2 caused smaller values of PBLH. The improvement of the water vapor retrieval in AIRS version 7 over version 6 results in the version 7 PBLH agreeing better with GPS RO and MERRA-2 than version 6, especially near the equator and low latitudes."

The IKP2 measurements were made as part of an international collaborative effort to investigate the measurement of supercooled large drop (SLD) conditions in several icing wind tunnels. This report focuses on the IKP2 and background water vapor (BWV) measurements made within the NASA IRT during the October 2017 test entry. The IKP2 TWC results are compared to the IRT LWC calibration values for a range of LWC and MVD values. The IRT LWC calibration is based on measurements from a multi-element hot-wire probe. In general, the IKP2 TWC values were approximately 9% greater than the IRT LWC calibration values over a range of LWC from 0.4 g/m3 to 3.0 g/m3. The ratio of IKP2 TWC to IRT LWC calibration ranged from approximately 0.9 to 1.27 over a range of MVD from 15um to 460 um. Comparisons of this data set to IKP2 data from a 2014 IRT test entry show similar results in the regions where overlaps occurred. The results support the theory and observations of water mass loss from hot-wire TWC sensors when subjected to large MVD conditions."

Deforestation, increased pumping for farming, and effects of climate change such as droughts and forest fires threaten the health of the lake and food security in the region. This project built upon the previous term through a partnership with Conservation International (CI), the Cambodian Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, and the Tonlé Sap Authority to assess ecosystem vitality and implement CI’s Freshwater Health Index (FHI) tool, in an effort to prioritize resource expenditure and highlight areas of concern. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions, partners had not been able to readily collect in situ data for the past year, which make up the majority of FHI inputs. To help fill this data gap, we developed a methodology for using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to calculate groundwater storage depletion, and a Python Application Programming Interface for processing and formatting remotely-sensed data for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. We then used SWAT to model nutrient flows and of phosphorous, nitrogen and suspended sediments amounts in the basin from October 2000 to December 2020. These outputs served as inputs for the FHI and provided policy makers with robust monitoring information to aid decision-making in the area and safeguard the lake’s vital fisheries and biodiversity."

For a global nuclear war, heating in the stratosphere, reduced photolysis, and an increase in catalytic loss from the Hox cycle cause a 15 year-long reduction in the ozone column, with a peak loss of 75% globally and 65% in the tropics. This is larger than predictions from the 1980s, which assumed large injections of nitrogen oxides (NOx),but did not include the effects of smoke. NOx from the fireball and the fires provide a small (5%) Increase to the global average ozone loss for the first few years. Initially, soot would shield the surface from UV-B, but UV Index values would become extreme: greater than 35in the tropics for 4years, and greater than 45during the summer in the southern polar regions for 3 years. For a regional war, global column ozone would be reduced by 25% with recovery taking 12 years. This is similar to previous simulations, but with a faster recovery time due to a shorter lifetime for soot in our simulations. In-line photolysis provides process specific action spectra enabling future integration with biogeochemistry models and allows output that quantifies the potential health impacts from changes in surface UV for this and other larger aerosol injections."

Incorporating CMCs into the hot section of gas-turbine engines therefore leads to an increase in engine efficiency. While significant advancements have been made, challenges still remain for current and next-generation gas-turbines; particularly when operating in dust-laden or erosive environments. Solid particles entrained in the gas flow can impact engine hardware resulting in localized damage and material removal due to repeated, cumulative impacts. In this study, the erosion behavior of a melt-infiltrated (MI) silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (SiC/SiC) CMC is investigated at high temperature (1,200 °C) in a simulated combustion environment using 150 µm alumina particles as erodent. Particle impact velocities ranged from 100 to 200 m/s and the angle of impingement varied from 30° to 90°. Erosion testing was also performed on α-SiC to elucidate similarities and differences in the erosion response of the composite compared to that of a monolithic ceramic. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the post-erosion damage morphology and the governing mechanisms of material removal."

We analyze how the risk of extreme soil moisture droughts in SWNA, analogous to the most severe 21-year (≥ in magnitude to 2000–2020) and single-year (≥ in magnitude to 2002) events of the last several decades, changes in projections from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. By the end of the 21st century, SWNA experiences robust (R ≥ 0.80) soil moisture drying and substantial increases in extreme single-year drought risk that scale strongly with warming, spanning an 8%–26% probability of occurrence across +2–4 K. Notably, our results show that 21-year droughts analogous to 2000–2020 are up to 5 times more likely than extreme single-year droughts under all levels of warming (≈50%). These high levels of 21-year drought risk are largely invariant across scenarios because of large spring precipitation declines in half the models, shifting SWNA into a drier mean state. Despite projections of this sweeping and ostensibly inevitable increase in 21-year drought risk, climate mitigation reduces their severity by reducing the magnitude of extreme single-year droughts during these events. Our results emphasize both the importance of preparing SWNA for imminent increases in persistent drought events and constraining projected precipitation uncertainty to better resolve future long-term drought risk."

To date, limited information on the distribution of Russian olive in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming have hampered management efforts and decision making. Here, we detect and model the distribution of Russian Olive using field surveys, ocular sampling, and variables from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) using the Random Forest algorithm. We derived topographic, spectral, and hydrological variables from Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, and SRTM to utilize as model inputs. The team was able to successfully create a spectral Russian olive detection map for the Powder River Basin (RMSE =15.44%, R2 = 0.6482). The team also examined change in stream channel geomorphology from 1984-2020 in a time-series analysis using Landsat visible imagery and the RivMap MATLAB package and found little change. Our results will help our partners at the Powder River County Weed Board, Gay Ranch, United States Geological Survey, and University of Northern Colorado to locate and prioritize areas for riparian habitat restoration and to understand the region’s hydrology and geomorphology."

However, crop yield estimates are currently subjective, based on interviews with qualified informants (i.e., farmers, agribusiness actors). In partnership with the Buenos Aires Grain Exchange, we leveraged Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM IMERG) NASA Earth observations to develop a Google Earth Engine (GEE) toolset to monitor vegetation growth. The first component of the toolset produces spatial and temporal maps of temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), allowing users to visualize the influence of the region’s climate and weather. Next, we developed an autoregressive model to predict NDVI several months in advance. Lastly, we created a linear regression model of crop yield and NDVI for soybeans, corn, and wheat, and input the forecasted NDVI to generate a predicted crop yield output. The NDVI forecasting model produced accurate predictions at two, four, and six months when examining the most recent growing season. In the crop yield model, soybeans exhibited moderately strong correlation, wheat had consistent weak correlation, and corn varied from weak to strong correlation depending on zone. This information is vital for vegetation growth monitoring by identifying areas of high growth and allocating resources to areas of lower growth to efficiently maximize crop yields."

The method combines efficient aircraft parameter estimation, for identifying closed-loop dynamics models, with online nonlinear optimization, for sequentially perturbing and updating control gains to improve performance.  Access to flight measurements and the control gains is required, but no prior information about the aircraft dynamics or the flight control architecture is needed.  After the procedure, the optimized control gains (with uncertainties), the open-loop dynamics model, and the closed-loop dynamics model are available.  The method is demonstrated for tuning a longitudinal stability augmentation system using a realistic nonlinear flight dynamics simulation of a subscale airplane.  Convergence was attained using five maneuvers that spanned approximately one minute of flight test time.  Although shown for a relatively simple case, the method is general and can be applied to other aircraft, axes of motion, performance metrics, and control system designs."

Herein, through structural design at the macro scale, the shape-memory response   is   augmented   with   an   auxetic   effect   manifested   by   a   negative   Poisson’s   ratio   of approximately -0.8 at 15% compressive strain. Thus, auxetic shape-memory PIR-PUR monoliths experience volume  contraction  upon compression at a temperature above the glass transition temperature   of the  base  polymer  (Tg ~  30  °C), and  they  can  be  stowed indefinitely   in  that temporary shape by cooling below  Tg.

Dysfunctional kinases are implicated in several types of cancers and hence they are actively pursued as drug targets.  Given the vast number of complex kinase structures that are available in the protein data bank (PDB), there is a necessity to develop methodologies that can identify structurally important moieties of the kinases in an automated fashion, for such techniques can be instrumental in identifying novel drug targets.  In this work, we develop a graph neural network (GNN) based deep learning framework for classifying the functionally active and inactive states of a large set of eukaryotic protein kinases, making use of their 3D structure from the PDB.  We show that GNN based machine learning models can classify protein states with an accuracy greater than 97%.  We further use the GNN models to automatically identify regions of the kinases that are important for its function.  For this purpose, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was implemented on the protein graphs.  Remarkably, Grad-CAM consistently identifies the highly conserved DFG motif as the most important part of the protein across the entire kinome, without any prior input.  Other regions of the hydrophobic core such as the HRD motif were also identified by the interpretable GNN framework, consistent with the literature.  We discuss the significance of each of these regions in detail."

Having  demonstrated  thefeasibility of the SoOp techniques at P- and S-band, the devel-opment of SoOp measurements beyond the GNSS frequencyregime  is  highly  anticipated.   The  SoOp  Coherent  Bistatic(SCoBi) model and simulator, developed in 2017 and open-sourced in 2018, has been made available to provide multi-frequency,  fully  polarimetric  SoOp  simulations  for  ground-based  applications  through  the  joint  use  of  analytical  wavetheory  and  distorted  Borne  approximation  to  evaluate  landcontributions from multilayer dielectric profiles composed ofsoil moisture, vegetation, and surface roughness effects. Thispaper  describes  the  advancement  of  SCoBi  from a ground-and airborne-based model to a spaceborne model.  This ex-tension allows for fully polarimetric, complex delay-Dopplermap (DDM) simulations through evaluation of the coherentsuperposition of electric fields emerging from a grid of ori-ented  facets.   The  model  generates  a  grid  of  facets  by  de-termining the geometry of contributing elements from digitalelevation models,  with each element providing its contribu-tion under a flat-earth assumption.  This module will enablethe analysis of fully polarimetric scattering from frequenciesavailable across the ultra-high frequency (UHF) regime."

The European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission was the first (2009-present) spaceborne L-band radiometer. This was followed by two L-band missions flown by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to measure sea surface salinity (Aquarius 2011-2015) and soil moisture (SMAP 2015-present). It is critical to continue the time series of L-band observations that these missions have begun. To address this need we propose a new low-cost instrument concept known as the Global L-band active/passive Observatory for Water cycle Studies (GLOWS) that will include an L-band radiometer and radar to provide data continuity.

The new mission concept includes a deployable reflectarray lens antenna with a compact feed that can be flown on an Earth Venture class satellite in a EELV Secondary Payload Adapter
(ESPA) Grande-class mission. GLOWS will continue the science observations of SMAP and SMOS at the same resolution and accuracy at substantially lower cost, size, and weight."

P-band is needed to penetrate through dense vegetation and into the root zone. The longer wavelength of P-band also increases the unwrapping interval for phase observations. These observations  hold  the  potential  for  spaceborne  remote  sensing  of root-zone  soil  moisture  (RZSM)  and  snow  water  equivalent(SWE),  two  variables  identified  as  priorities  in  the  2017-2027 Decadal Survey for Earth Science and Applications from Space.  SNOOPI  will  provide  in-space  validation  of  both  the P-band  SoOp  technique  and  a  science  instrument  prototype. SNOOPI technology validation goals will be met by targeting observations within 9 km of the SMAP calibration/validation sites in the continental United States. A secondary priority is collection of continuous phase data over snow-covered regions. These goals are evaluated under constraints of a limited data budget and mission lifetime, with a launch readiness in early2022.  Updates  on  the  development  of  measurement  models and  mission  planning  to  support  SNOOPI  are  provided.  Aground-based  station  will  be  deployed  to  monitor  the  non-cooperative sources, in order to reduce risk due to uncertainty in  knowledge  of  the  broadcast  power,  spectrum  shape,  and orbital position."

A global Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model provides routine near-real time estimates of landslide hazard using Integrated Multi-Satellite Precipitation Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Mission (IMERG). However, it does not provide information on potential landslide hazard in the future. Forecasting potential landslide events at a global scale presents an area of open research. This  study compares a  global precipitation forecast provided by  NASA’s  Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) with  near-real time  satellite precipitation estimates. The  Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor gauge corrected (MRMS-GC) reference is used to assess the performance of both satellite and model-based precipitation products over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The forecast lead time of 24hrs is considered, with a focus on extreme precipitation events. The performance of IMERG and GEOS-Forecast products is assessed in terms of the probability of detection, success ratio, critical success index and hit bias as well as continuous statistics. The results show that seasonality influences the performance of both satellite and model-based precipitation products. Comparison of IMERG and GEOS-Forecast globally as well as in several event case studies (Colombia, southeast Asia, and Tajikistan) reveals that GEOS-Forecast detects extreme rainfall more frequently relative to IMERG for these specific analyses. For recent landslide points across the globe, the 24hr accumulated precipitation forecast >100 mm corresponds well with near-real time daily accumulated IMERG precipitation estimates. GEOS-Forecast and IMERG precipitation match more closely for tropical cyclones than for other types of storms. The main intention of this study is to assess the viability of using a global forecast for landslide predictions and understand the extent of the variability between these products to inform where we would expect the landslide modeling results to most prominently diverge. Results of this study will be used to inform how forecasted precipitation estimates can be incorporated into the LHASA model to provide the first global predictive view of landslide hazards."

Such structures are usually attached  to  surfaces,  and  on  Earth,  they have been  found  in  diverse  and  extreme  environments.  Such agglomerations have been described as recalcitrant or protective when facing adversity. In space systems, biofilms  have  been  found  on a  multitude  of hardware  surfaces.  Different  studies  have  identified genetic changes  that  may impact human  health.  The insufficiency of consistent research may  return inconclusive arguments as to what extent microgravity encourages virulence and how biofilms could exacerbate crewed spaceflight–especially ones to remote areas with a lack of resupply and service missions. However, biofilms are also beneficial to plant biology, and they may supply in metabolic pathways that produce useful organic and inorganic components to maintain life in other celestial bodies. There are expansive areas of research that  look  into  biofilms  in  space  and  scientific  recommendations  that  reflect  on  expanding  the  aerospace industry’s knowledge of biofilms, how to mitigate, or use them to the advantage of spaceflight."

The P-SMP will be mounted to a leg of the lander and will be responsible for collecting surface regolith alongside the JAXA provide Core Sampler (C-SMP).  The Sampling  Funnel of  the  P-SMP utilizes  two  sets of sampling  nozzles:  one  set  of  nozzles  pointed directly at the surface to kick-up and loft material into the sampling head, and a second set of nozzles to direct the oncoming material into the sample return canister further up the lander leg. A robotic arm  mounted  underneath  the  lander will then  remove  the  sample  canister  and  place  it  inside  the sample return capsule for Earth return. Several iterations of the P-Sampler have been designed and tested inside a vacuum chamber with Phobos regolith simulant.

Understanding and managing the species and its habitats is challenging due to the complex interactions among the social system, a dynamic mosaic of scrub habitat, and active management. To provide insights into the possible fates of the FSJ populations of mainland, cape, and island sections of Brevard County, we modeled the population dynamics using the Vortex population viability analysis (PVA) software. Vortex is an individual-based simulation that allowed us to include such factors as demographic rates dependent on habitat state, impact of helpers on breeding success, and helper to breeder transition probabilities responding to availability of nearby vacant optimal habitat and vacancies due to the death of breeders. Detailed modeling of the FSJ was possible only because a lot of data about the species and its habitats have been gathered over decades of intensive research. 

We followed a phased approach to constructing population models that incorporated the best available science and data to address a variety of conservation actions. The first phase focused on constructing a model that incorporates sociobiology and source-sink habitat dynamics. This model allowed us to address some of the most important questions about population size and habitat quality. Once the model framework was in place, we considered the real landscapes and actual local populations, rather than just generic representations of typical FSJ dynamics. After examining the viability of the metapopulations under current conditions, we explored the likely consequences of various management actions that might slow or reverse population declines."

The approach relies on dictionary matching and locally constrained least squares. The results demonstrate that the algorithm can invert the DMRT model and retrieve depth, density, and grain size of a single-layer snowpack when dependencies of density and grain size on depth are properly accounted for. However, as the number of layers increases, the sensitivity of the inversion to observation noise grows markedly. Using observations, over the Great Plains in the United States, from the microwave imager onboard the global precipitation measurement (GPM, 10-166 GHz) core satellite, the initial results demonstrate that under a clear-sky condition and no vegetation canopy, the algorithm is capable to retrieve the snow depth and water equivalent of seasonal snow with a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 0.15 m--when compared to the high-resolution analysis data from the SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS)."

Of particular interest is the surface value of the vertical frictional PV flux which when positive, can induce destruction of PV by down-front winds. The 2005 numerical simulations of Thomas confirmed that this is indeed the case. However, since the 12 km numerical resolution could not account for sub-mesoscales SM (0.1-10) km, the effect of SM on the PV destruction process could not be quantified. The goal of this work is to provide an answer to that question asked in the title. The two SM parameterizations entering the   problem, the vertical buoyancy flux and the momentum flux (Reynolds stresses), bring about a new feature, the dependence on the SM kinetic energy (represented by the dimensionless Rossby number Ro), that causes unexpected results. While in the absence of SM, there were no restrictions on where PV destruction could occur, in the presence of SM, the condition of a positive surface vertical frictional flux is restricted to SM regimes with very low Ro<1 and very high Ro>10. Since the SM kinetic energy is location dependent, so is PV destruction. The effect of SM seems to make PV destruction a much rarer occurrence than previously thought."

Our investigations indicate that upregulation of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and de novo lipogenesis, commonly observed in many cancers, are associated with nucleotide metabolic dysfunction in lymphoma. The results from our experiments showed that ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide pool depletion, suppression of global RNA/DNA synthesis, and cell cycle inhibition occurred in the presence of FASN inhibition. Subsequently, we observed that FASN inhibition caused metabolic blockade in the rate-limiting step of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) catalyzed by phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH). Furthermore, we determined that FASN inhibitor treatment resulted in NADPH accumulation and inhibition of PGDH enzyme activity. NADPH is a cofactor utilized by FASN, also a known allosteric inhibitor of PGDH. Through cell-free enzyme assays consisting of FASN and PGDH, we delineated that the PGDH-catalyzed ribulose-5-phosphate synthesis is enhanced in the presence of FASN and is suppressed by increasing concentrations of NADPH. Additionally, we observed that FASN and PGDH were colocalized in the cytosol. The results from these experiments led us to conclude that NADP–NADPH turnover and the reciprocal stimulation of FASN and PGDH catalysis are involved in promoting oxPPP and nucleotide biosynthesis in lymphoma. Finally, a transcriptomic analysis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n = 624) revealed the increased expression of genes associated with metabolic functions interlinked with oxPPP, while the expression of genes participating in oxPPP remained unaltered. Together we conclude that FASN–PGDH enzymatic interactions are involved in enabling oxPPP and nucleotide metabolic dysfunction in lymphoma tumors."

Recovery of this faint signal was technically challenging. The bright ring of sunlight forward-scattered by haze in the Plutonian atmosphere encircling the nightside hemisphere was severely overexposed, defeating the standard smeared-charge removal required for LORRI images. Reconstruction of the overexposed portions of the raw images, however, allowed adequate corrections to be accomplished. The small solar elongation of Pluto during the departure phase also generated a complex scattered-sunlight background in the images that was three orders of magnitude stronger than the estimated Charon-light flux (the Charon-light flux is similar to the flux of moonlight on Earth a few days before first quarter). A model background image was constructed for each Pluto image based on principal component analysis applied to an ensemble of scattered-sunlight images taken at identical Sun−spacecraft geometry to the Pluto images. The recovered Charon-light image revealed a high-albedo region in the southern hemisphere. We argue that this may be a regional deposit of N2 or CH4 ice. The Charon-light image also shows that the south polar region currently has markedly lower albedo than the north polar region of Pluto, which may reflect the sublimation of N2 ice or the deposition of haze particulates during the recent southern summer."

The source is a self-interacting scalar field which is non-minimally coupled to gravity through the Gauss–Bonnet invariant. The scalar-Gauss–Bonnet coupling function is characterized by three positive parameters: σ with units of (length), μ with units of (length)4, and a dimensionless parameter s, thus defining a three-parameter model for which the line element of CABH is a solution. The spacetime is equipped with spherical and static symmetry and has a single horizon determined in Schwarzschild coordinates by the region r = μ^(1/4). The solution admits a photon sphere at r = (3μ)^(1/4), and it is shown that in the region (3μ)^(1/4) ⩽ r < ∞ the scalar field satisfies the null, weak, and strong energy conditions. Nonetheless, the model with s = 1 has major physical relevance since for this case the scalar field is well defined in the entire region r ⩾ μ^(1/4), while for s ≠ 1 the scalar field blows up on the horizon."

Very-high resolution (VHR, <2 m) stereo derived digital surface models are available to monitor these forests, but, a similar resolution digital terrain model (DTM) is required to extract information about tree height, which is often used to estimate carbon content. To our knowledge, no openly available VHR DTM currently exists. To address this need, we developed approaches to extract DTMs by filtering VHR stereo point clouds (PCs) in sparse canopies of Alaska. Our evaluation consisted of two stereo processing methods with three PC search radii, at six different tree canopy cover (TCC) intervals. We found VHR DTMs were robust for estimating bare ground at TCC intervals less than 40% with vertical errors <1.6 m using airborne small footprint light detection and ranging (LiDAR) as reference."

Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the temporal variations in CH4 growth, which attributes the rise of atmospheric CH4 either to increases in emissions from fossil fuel activities, agriculture, and natural wetlands or to a decrease in the atmospheric chemical sink. Here, we use a comprehensive ensemble of CH4 source estimates and isotopic δ13C-CH4 source signature data to show that the resumption of CH4 growth is most likely due to increased anthropogenic emissions. Our emission scenarios that have the fewest biases with respect to isotopic composition suggest that the agriculture, landfill, and waste sectors were responsible for 53 ± 13% of the renewed growth over the period 2007–2017 compared to 2000–2006; industrial fossil fuel sources explained an additional 34 ± 24%,  and wetland sources contributed the least at 13 ± 9%. The hypothesis that a large increase in emissions from natural wetlands drove the decrease in atmospheric δ13C-CH4 values cannot be reconciled with current process-based wetland CH4 models. This finding suggests the need for increased wetland measurements to better constrain the contemporary and future role of wetlands in the rise of atmospheric methane and climate feedbacks. Our findings highlight the predominant role of anthropogenic activities in driving the growth of atmospheric CH4 concentrations."

The model geometry and the flow conditions are selected to match the experiments conducted in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel (BAM6QT) at Purdue University. The geometry consists of a nominally sharp 5-degree half-angle cone, followed by a cylindrical segment and then a 10-degree flare. An axisymmetric separation bubble is generated as a result of the laminar shock/boundary-layer interaction in the cylinder-flare region. The comparison of the laminar flow solution and the schlieren images shows a remarkable agreement between the respective locations of both the boundarylayer edge and the reattachment shock. The predicted heat flux distribution is also in agreement with the measured values downstream of the reattachment location. The analysis of convective and global instabilities is performed for flare half angles equal to 8, 10, and 12 degrees and nosetip radii equal to 0.1, 1, and 5 mm. The linear amplification of first and second Mack mode instabilities that begin to amplify in the cone region are computed with a combination of the parabolized stability equations (PSE) and the harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE). The predicted frequency spectra of the surface pressure fluctuations associated with both planar and oblique instability waves are compared with the measured spectra at the various locations of the PCB and Kulite sensors. The comparison shows that the computational analysis captures the distinct lobes within the disturbance amplification spectra measured in the experiments, but some differences in amplification characteristics are noted at low frequencies. Overall, the oblique disturbances are found to be more amplified than the planar disturbances. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful comparison between convective instability analysis and measured surface pressure fluctuations for a hypersonic configuration with a separation bubble. Finally, the global instability analysis shows that the laminar flow becomes supercritical for flare half angles larger than 8 degrees. The unstable global mode for the experimental configuration of a 10 degrees flare and a sharp nosetip cone corresponds to a stationary three-dimensional disturbance that is concentrated in the recirculation region and achieves its maximum growth rate for an azimuthal wavenumber of 5."

Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida. For the purposes of this report, two separate plumes, known as the Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB)/Volatile Organic Aromatic (VOA) Plume and the Chlorinated Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Plume were identified for this site. The contaminants of concern (COCs) for the PCB/VOA Plume consists of PCBs, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and breakdown products of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. The COCs for the Chlorinated VOC Plume are tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, and vinyl chloride. 

The activities presented in this report include four field events: (1) October 2020 – Chlorinated VOC Plume groundwater sampling via Direct Push Technology (DPT) – 68 groundwater samples were collected from 14 locations at varying intervals; (2) December 2020 – Site-wide semi-annual water level measurements of 52 monitoring wells and sampling of 39 monitoring wells; (3) May 2021 – Chlorinated VOC Plume monitoring well installation – two monitoring wells were installed and screened from 10 to 20 feet below land surface (bls); and (4) May/June 2021 – Site-wide semi-annual water level measurements of 53 monitoring wells and sampling of 40 monitoring wells.  Results showed substantial reduction of both plumes.  Conclusions and recommendations are presented."

Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida. The site is monitored under KSC’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program. Adaptive site management is being utilized through ongoing assessment, design, and interim measures. This approach also meets the requirements of Chapter 62-780, Florida Administrative Code. The goal of LTM at this site is threefold: to determine groundwater flow characteristics, monitor the downgradient concentration trends, and monitor select locations internal to the groundwater plume. Every 5 years, upgradient and side-gradient monitoring wells are sampled to verify delineation. The last time this was performed was in 2015. Sampling of these wells in 2020 was replaced with the direct push technology investigations in October 2020 and April 2021.

The activities presented in this report include three field events: (1) December 2019 -groundwater gauging of 38 monitoring wells and sampling of 36 monitoring wells; (2) May 2020 - groundwater sampling of 7 monitoring wells; and (3) December 2020 - groundwater gauging of 49 monitoring wells and sampling of 43 monitoring wells. During the December 2019 and May 2020 events, monitoring wells were sampled using passive diffusion bags and were analyzed for a “full list” of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including Freon 113. During the December 2020 event, the low flow sampling method was used, and samples were analyzed for a “select list” of VOCs, including Freon 113.

The following conclusions can be made based on the 2019 and 2020 LTM results:

     •In December 2019 and December 2020, groundwater flow for the site was generally to the west with the individual zones only varying by occasional northerly and southerly components. This is generally consistent with historical observations at the site.
     •The GCTL plume continues to extend both horizontally and vertically beyond our current monitoring well network. 
     •The vertical extent of VOCs was historically generally delineated by monitoring wells screened greater than 48 feet bls. The results from the two vertical extent monitoring wells WILC-MW0078 and WILC-MW0130 that were sampled during the 2019 and 2020 LTM indicate that groundwater VOC concentrations in both wells were greater than the GCTL.
     •Freon 113 was not detected above GCTLs during the 2019 and 2020 LTM events. 

Based on groundwater sampling activities performed during this reporting period, including recent DPT groundwater sampling conducted for the implementation of an air sparge system, the following recommendations are provided:

     •Install 10 new monitoring wells, which will be sampled along with 49 existing monitoring wells, to assist with delineation of the low concentration plume. The wells are listed inTable 4-1, and the proposed locations are presented on Figures4 -1 through 4-5. (Figures 4-1, 4-2, 4-3, and 4-5 also show updated plumes and proposed performance monitoring well locations. This information will be discussed and presented under a separate cover.)
     •Modify the annual LTM sampling plan as presented inTable 4-1. 
     •Sampling for future events at the site will be conducted using low flow pumping methods. 

The next annual LTM sampling event is currently planned for December 2021. Please note the 10 new monitoring wells will not be installed before this event but will be installed as part of the upcoming IM construction and will be sampled during baseline sampling, along with the 49 existing monitoring wells. Following this sampling event, it is recommended that the Annual LTM be combined with the performance monitoring under the IM implementation, and LTM be temporarily discontinued. 

Objectives of the 2021 LTM are to: (i) evaluate groundwater gradient and flow direction by collecting depth to water measurements from LTM wells; (ii) continue monitoring the peripheral VOC trends in the northern, southern, and western portions of the site by monitoring existing wells and installing and monitoring new wells as recommended; and (iii) monitor select internal plume wells."

High-angular-resolution observa-tions play a key role in our understanding of the disk structure and the dynamical processes at work.Aims.In this study we aim to characterize the mid-infrared brightness distribution of the inner disk of the young intermediate-massstar HD 163296 from early VLTI/MATISSE observations taken in theL- andN-bands. We put special emphasis on the detection ofpotential disk asymmetries.Methods.We use simple geometric models to fit the interferometric visibilities and closure phases. Our models include a smoothedring, a flat disk with an inner cavity, and a 2D Gaussian. The models can account for disk inclination and for azimuthal asymmetriesas well. We also perform numerical hydrodynamical simulations of the inner edge of the disk.Results.Our modeling reveals a significant brightness asymmetry in theL-band disk emission. The brightness maximum of the asym-metry is located at the NW part of the disk image, nearly at the position angle of the semimajor axis. The surface brightness ratio inthe azimuthal variation is3.5±0.2. Comparing our result on the location of the asymmetry with other interferometric measurements,we confirm that the morphology of ther<0.3au disk region is time-variable. We propose that this asymmetric structure, located in ornear the inner rim of the dusty disk, orbits the star. To find the physical origin of the asymmetry, we tested a hypothesis where a vortexis created by Rossby wave instability, and we find that a unique large-scale vortex may be compatible with our data. The half-lightradius of theL-band-emitting region is0.33±0.01au, the inclination is52◦+5◦−7◦, and the position angle is143◦±3◦. Our models predictthat a non-negligible fraction of theL-band disk emission originates inside the dust sublimation radius forμm-sized grains. Refractorygrains or large (&10μm-sized) grains could be the origin of this emission.N-band observations may also support a lack of smallsilicate grains in the innermost disk (r.0.6au), in agreement with our findings fromL-band data."

However, it is not well understood how projected changes in the snow-related extremes differ across North America. Using dynamically downscaled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, we found that the magnitudes of extreme snow water equivalent, snowmelt, and runoff potential (RP; snowmelt plus precipitation) decrease by 72%, 73%, and 45%, respectively, over the continental United States and southern Canada but increase by up to 8%, 53%, and 41% in Alaska and northern Canada by the late 21st century. In California and the Pacific Northwest, there is a notable increase in extreme RP by 21% contrary to a decrease in snowmelt by 31% by the late century. These regions could be vulnerable to larger rain-on-snow floods in a warmer climate. Regions with a large variability among RCM ensembles are identified, which require further investigation to reduce the regional uncertainties."

However, the aerogel formulation must be optimized to increase the thermal stability of the aerogels, as a drastic densification and decrease in surface area often is exhibited after high-temperature exposure. This work considers yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) aerogels, whichhave low thermal conductivity and are expected to be used for temperatures between 600°C and 1000°C. It is anticipated that new sol-gel chemistries will yield YSZ aerogels that exhibit retained mesoporous structure, increased surface area, and minimized shrinkage upon exposure to higher temperatures in the expected use range. This work investigates the addition of surfactant to 20 mol% YSZ aerogels. The cationic surfactant, cetrimonium bromide (CTAB), was used as the templating agent, preventing the collapse of the mesoporous structure upon gelation and drying. It was determined that adding one-half times the critical micelle concentration of CTAB increased the surface area of the aerogels by 72% and 41% and increased the pore volume following exposure to 600°C and1000°C, respectively. This level of CTAB had the greatest increase in surface area and pore volume as compared to aerogels without CTAB or with twice the critical micelle concentration of CTAB. By optimizing the concentration of CTAB, the thermal stability ofYSZ aerogels can be enhanced to make these materials more efficient when used as thermal management systems."

The coupling of FUN3D and LASTRAC allows for a robust physics-based approach to model boundary-layer transition by analyzing the growth of different instability waves and then using that information to iteratively update the resulting transition location. There is no user involvement during the iterative computations. We apply this automated method to subsonic flow over a flat plate with a sharp leading edge. The final solution has regions of laminar and turbulent flow with a transition onset location that agrees with experiments and stability-based correlations. This iterative automated method is also applied to an NLF(1)-0416 airfoil for conditions with and without a separation bubble. Along with predicting transition locations, we compare the streamwise distributions of surface-pressure and skin-friction coefficients to a transport-equation-based model. We consider a 6:1 prolate spheroid at three angles of attack, namely, five, ten, and fifteen degrees, where mixed-mode transition occurs due to both Tollmien-Schlichting and crossflow instabilities. The skin-friction contours and transition fronts at every angle of attack from our iterative automated method show good agreement with past experimental and computational results in the literature for the 6:1 prolate spheroid."

Two traditional approaches are widely used to calculate fire emissions: a satellite-based top-down approach and a fuels-based bottom-up approach. However, these methods often considerably disagree on the amount of particulate mass emitted from fires. Previously available observational datasets tended to be sparse, and lacked the statistics needed to resolve these methodological discrepancies. Here, we leverage the extensive and comprehensive airborne in situ and remote sensing measurements of smoke plumes from the recent Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) campaign to statistically assess the skill of the two traditional approaches. We use detailed campaign observations to calculate and compare emission rates at an exceptionally high-resolution using three separate approaches: top-down, bottom-up, and a novel approach based entirely on integrated airborne in situ measurements. We then compute the daily average of these high-resolution estimates and compare with estimates from lower resolution, global top-down and bottom-up inventories. We uncover strong, linear relationships between all of the high-resolution emission rate estimates in aggregate, however no single approach is capable of capturing the emission characteristics of every fire. Global inventory emission rate estimates exhibited weaker correlations with the high-resolution approaches and displayed evidence of systematic bias. The disparity between the low resolution global inventories and the high-resolution approaches is likely caused by high levels of uncertainty in essential variables used in bottom-up inventories and imperfect assumptions in top-down inventories.

Plain Language Summary

Smoke emitted by wildland fires is dangerous to human health and contributes to climate change.To predict and evaluate the impacts of fires, we need to know how much smoke is emitted into the atmosphere. There are two state-of-the-art methods used to estimate the mass of smoke emitted by fires, but they often disagree. In this study, we use unusually detailed measurements collected using an aircraft that flew within wildland fire smoke plumes to calculate the amount ofsmoke emitted from fires in the Western United States. We compare emission rates derived from the exceptionally high spatial and temporal resolution approach to the two traditional, lower resolution approaches to understand why they sometimes diverge"

demands. Lithium metal batteries are a leading candidate to fulfill this energy requirement, but
these batteries are prone to internal dendrite defects that can lead to catastrophic thermal runaway
events. Current battery management systems are capable of mitigating such risks, but are unable
to detect such defects until thermal runaway has already begun. Various nondestructive evaluation
(NDE) techniques, particularly ultrasonic NDE, can directly monitor internal battery parameters
giving them the potential to detect critical defects prior to catastrophic failure. However, most of
the current battery NDE research has focused on improved battery state-of-charge (SOC) and stateof-
health (SOH) monitoring with little emphasis on critical defect detection. Thus, a measurement
technique sensitive to subtle battery defects is needed. In addition, the complex mechanics of
ultrasound in porous, thin, multilayered batteries prompt the use of physics-based simulation to
guide inspections.

In this work, an ultrasonic NDE technique has been developed utilizing frequency domain
analysis of local battery resonances to detect the presence of battery defects. This technique is a
practical extension of local ultrasonic resonance spectroscopy (LURS) – which previously required
non-contact laser ultrasonics – to measurements with piezoelectric contact and immersion scan
transducers. To extend the technique to work with piezoelectric transducers, ultrasonic battery
measurements were compared to a sans-battery calibration measurement. Then, a linear systems
deconvolution was used to eliminate the transfer functions of extraneous factors such as the
transducer and electronics, leaving only the frequency-dependent battery reflection coefficient.

The LURS technique was first validated on stainless steel and aluminum plates, producing
reflection coefficients in line with analytical and numerical finite element modeling (FEM) results.
Functioning Li-metal pouch cells were then seeded with lithium chip defects prior to LURS
measurements. The presence of these defects is shown to cause a measurable shift in the battery’s
through-thickness local resonances. 2D, frequency-domain poroelastic models of ultrasonic
propagation in a single-cell lithium metal pouch battery were created and corroborated these
findings. Thus, this work has both extended and proven the feasibility of the LURS technique in
the detection of local battery defects."

Mission-tailored research and development in modeling of entry systems occurs across the Agency (e.g., within the Orion and Mars 2020 Programs), however the aim of this paper is to discuss the broad, cross-mission research conducted by NASA’s Entry Systems Modeling (ESM) Project, which serves as the Agency’s only concerted effort toward advancing entry systems across a range of technical disciplines. Technology development in ESM is organized and prioritized from a system-level perspective, resulting in four broad technical areas of investment: (1) Predictive material modeling, (2) Shock layer kinetics and radiation, (3) Computational and experimental aerosciences, and (4) Guidance, navigation, and control. Investments in thermal protection material modeling are geared toward high-fidelity, predictive models capable of handling complex structures, with an eye toward optimizing design performance and quantifying thermal protection system reliability. New computational tools have been developed to characterize material properties and behavior at the microstructural level, and experimental techniques (molecular beam scattering, micro-computed tomography, among others) have been developed to measure material kinetics, morphology, and other parameters needed to inform and validate detailed simulations. Advancements have also been made in macrostructural simulation capability to enable 3-D system-scale calculations of material response with complex topological features, including differential recession of tile gaps. Research and development in the area of shock layer kinetics has focused on air and CO2-based atmospheres. Capacity and capability of the NASA Ames Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) have been expanded in recent years and analysis of resulting data has led to several improvements in kinetic models, while simultaneously reducing uncertainties associated with radiative heat transfer predictions. First-principles calculations of fundamental kinetic, thermodynamic, and transport data, along with state-specificmodels for non-equilibrium flow regimes, have also yielded new insights and have the potential to vastly improve model fidelity. Aerosciences is a very broad area of interest in entry systems, yet a number of important challenges are being addressed: Coupled fluid-structure simulations of parachute inflation and dynamics; Experimental and computational studies of vehicle dynamics; Multi-phase flow with dust particles to simulate entry environments at Mars during dust storms; Studies of roughness-induced heating augmentation relevant to tiled and woven thermal protection systems; and Advanced numerical methods to optimize computational analyses for desired accuracy versus cost. Guidance and control in the context of entry systems has focused on development of methods for multi-axis control (i.e. pitch and yaw, rather than bank angle alone) of spacecraft during entry and descent. With precision landing requirements driven by Mars human exploration goals, recent efforts have yielded 6-DOF models of multi-axis control with propulsive descent of both inflatable and rigid ellipsled-like architectures. Results for both configurations have demonstrated the ability to land within the 50-meter precision requirement demanded by Mars human exploration missions, while also reducing propellant requirements by enabling more
efficient control through entry and descent. Ongoing research in GN&C is developing mechanical specifications for the systems and establishing engineering feasibility."

Sea ice significantly alters the character of these energy exchanges relative to ice-free ocean. The observed decline in Arctic sea ice since 1979 motivates questions related to the evolving role of surface-atmosphere coupling and potential feedbacks on the Arctic system. Due to the strong wintertime cloud warming effect, a critical question concerns the potential response of low clouds to Arctic sea ice decline. Previous approaches relied on interannual variability to investigate the cloud response to sea ice decline. However, the covariation between atmospheric conditions and sea ice makes it difficult to define an observational control when using interannual variability. To circumvent this difficulty, we exploit the recurring North Water polynya, an episodic opening in the northern Baffin Bay sea ice, as a natural laboratory to isolate the cloud response to a rapid, near-step perturbation in sea ice. Our results show that during the event, (a) low-cloud cover is 10%–33% larger over the polynya than nearby sea ice, (b) cloud liquid water content is up to 400% larger over the polynya than nearby sea ice, and (c) the surface cloud radiative effect is 18 W/sq. m larger over the polynya than nearby sea ice. Our results provide evidence that the low-cloud response during a polynya is a positive feedback lengthening the event."

At z>6, a typical galaxy without an active galactic nucleus fails to form a proximity zone around itself due to the overdensity of the surrounding IGM. The gravitational infall motion in the IGM makes the resonance absorption extend to the red side of Lyα, suppressing the transmission up to roughly the circular velocity of the galaxy. In some sight lines, an optically thin blob generated by a supernova in a neighboring galaxy results in a peak feature, which can be mistaken for a blue peak. Redward of the resonance absorption, the damping-wing opacity correlates with the global IGM neutral fraction and the UV magnitude of the source galaxy. Brighter galaxies tend to suffer lower opacity because they tend to reside in larger H II regions, and the surrounding IGM transmits redder photons, which are less susceptible to attenuation, owing to stronger infall velocity. The H II regions are highly nonspherical, causing both sight-line-to-sight-line and galaxy-to-galaxy variation in opacity. Also, self-shielded systems within H II regions strongly attenuate the emission for certain sight lines. All these factors add to the transmissivity variation, requiring a large sample size to constrain the average transmission. The variation is largest for fainter galaxies at higher redshift. The 68% range of the transmissivity is similar to or greater than the median for galaxies with M(sub UV) ≽ -21 at z ≽ 7, implying that more than a hundred galaxies would be needed to measure the transmission to 10% accuracy."

While these have no counterparts on Earth, they are important processes in the Solar System, particularly in the icy moons of the outer Solar System. We discuss mechanisms of cryomagmatism and cryovolcanism, the possible compositions of cryomagmas, and the observational evidence found so far in extraterrestrial bodies, ranging from plumes to surface features interpreted as cryovolcanic in origin."

These separate precipitation fields can be combined through weighted averaging, which produces estimates that are generally superior to the individual parent fields. However, the process of averaging changes the distribution of the precipitation values, leading to an increase in precipitating area and a decrease in the values of high precipitation rates, a phenomenon observed in IMERG. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a new scheme called SHARPEN (Scheme for Histogram Adjustment with Ranked Precipitation Estimates in the Neighborhood), which recovers the distribution of the averaged precipitation field based on the idea of quantile mapping applied to the local environment. When implemented in IMERG, precipitation estimates from SHARPEN exhibit a distribution that resembles that of the original instantaneous observations, with matching precipitating area and peak precipitation rates. Case studies demonstrate its improved ability in bridging between the parent precipitation fields. Evaluation against ground observations reveals a distinct improvement in precipitation detection skill, but also a slightly reduced correlation likely because of a sharper precipitation field. The increased computational demand of SHARPEN can be mitigated by striding over multiple grid boxes, which has only marginal impacts on the accuracy of the estimates. SHARPEN can be applied to any precipitation algorithm that produces an average from multiple input precipitation fields and is being considered for implementation in IMERG V07."

Part I: Observations from the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) Investigation and Modeling Results,"This study uses a model with aerosol–cloud–radiation coupling to examine the impact of Saharan dust and other aerosols on Hurricane Nadine (2012). To study aerosol direct (radiation) and indirect (cloud microphysics) effects from individual, as well as all aerosol species, eight different NU-WRF Model simulations were conducted. In several simulations, aerosols led to storm strengthening, followed by weakening relative to the control simulation. This variability of the aerosol impact may be related to whether aerosols are ingested into clouds within the outer rainbands or the eyewall. Upper-tropospheric aerosol concentrations indicate vertical transport of all aerosol types in the outer bands but only vertical transport of sea salt in the inner core. The results suggest that aerosols, particularly sea salt, may have contributed to a stronger initial intensification but that aerosol ingestion into the outer bands at later times may have weakened the storm in the longer term. In most aerosol experiments, aerosols led to a reduction in cloud and precipitation hydrometeors, the exception being the dust-only case that produced periods of enhanced hydrometeor growth. The Saharan air layer (SAL) also impacted Nadine by causing a region of strong easterlies impinging on the eastern side of the storm. At the leading edge of these easterlies, cool and dry air near the top of the SAL was being ingested into the outer-band convection. This midlevel low-equivalent-potential-temperature air gradually lowered toward the surface and eventually contributed to significant cold-pool activity in the eastern rainband and in the northeast quadrant of the storm. Such enhanced downdraft activity could have led to weakening of the storm, but it is not presently possible to quantify this impact."

This study showed that the free-running CTI instrument could be calibrated to produce scientifically useful radiance imagery of the atmosphere, clouds, and surfaces with a vertical resolution of ~460 m at limb and a horizontal resolution of ~80 m at nadir. The new detector demonstrated an excellent sensitivity to detect the weak limb radiance perturbations modulated by small-scale atmospheric gravity waves. The CTI’s high-resolution imaging was used to infer vertical cloud temperature profiles from a side-viewing geometry.  For  nadir  imaging,  the  combined  high-resolution  and  high-sensitivity  capabilities  allowed  the  CTI  to  better  separate  cloud  and  surface  emissions,  including  those  in  the  planetary  boundary layer (PBL) that had small contrast against the background surface.

Modeled gravimetry corrections are 5.22 times altimetry corrections over East Antarctica (EA) and 4.51 times over West Antarctica (WA), with inferred mantle densities 4.75 and 4.11 g/cu. cm. Derived sensitivities (Sg, Sa) to bedrock motion enable calculation of motion (δB0) needed to equalize GRACE and ICESat mass changes during 2003–08. For EA, δB0 is −2.2 mm/a subsidence with mass matching at 150 Gt/a, inland WA is −3.5 mm/a at 66 Gt/a, and coastal WA is only −0.35 mm/a at −95 Gt/a. WA subsidence is attributed to low mantle viscosity with faster responses to post-LGM deglaciation and to ice growth during Holocene grounding-line readvance. EA subsidence is attributed to Holocene dynamic thickening. With Antarctic Peninsula loss of −26 Gt/a, the Antarctic total gain is 95 ± 25 Gt/a during 2003–08, compared to 144 ± 61 Gt/a from ERS1/2 during 1992–2001.

Most existing domain adaptation models assume that source and target domains are homogeneous, i.e., they have the same feature space. Nevertheless, many real world applications often deal with data from heterogeneous domains that come from completely different feature spaces. In our remote sensing application, data in source domain (from an active spaceborne Lidar sensor CALIOP onboard CALIPSO satellite) contain 25 attributes, while data in target domain (from a passive spectroradiometer sensor VIIRS onboard Suomi-NPP satellite) contain 20 different attributes. CALIOP has better representation capability and sensitivity to aerosol types and cloud phase, while VIIRS has wide swaths and better spatial coverage but has inherent weakness in differentiating atmospheric objects on different vertical levels. To address this mismatch of features across the domains/sensors, we propose a novel end-to-end deep domain adaptation with domain mapping and correlation alignment (DAMA) to align the heterogeneous source and target domains in active and passive satellite remote sensing data. It can learn domain invariant representation from source and target domains by transferring knowledge across these domains, and achieve additional performance improvement by incorporating weak label information into the model (DAMA-WL). Our experiments on a collocated CALIOP and VIIRS dataset show that DAMA and DAMA-WL can achieve higher classification accuracy in predicting cloud types."

Parkes Observatory 3 GHz radio observations of the pulsar (taken about 7 yr before the NuSTAR observations) are also reported here. NuSTAR detected pulsations at a frequency of f ≍ 14.4 Hz (P ≍ 69.44 ms) and, in addition, the observation was long enough to measure the source's frequency derivative, ḟ ≈ -2.8 X10^(-11) Hz/s. We find that the pulsar shows one peak per period at both hard X-ray and radio wavelengths, but that the hard X-ray pulse is broader (having a duty cycle of ~0.7), than the radio pulse (having a duty cycle of ~0.08). Additionally, the radio pulse is strongly linearly polarized. J1617's phase-integrated hard X-ray spectrum is well fit by an absorbed power-law model, with a photon index Γ = 1.59 ± 0.02. The hard X-ray pulsations are well described by three Fourier harmonics, and have a pulsed fraction that increases with energy. We also fit the phase-resolved NuSTAR spectra with an absorbed power-law model in five phase bins and find that the photon index varies with phase from Γ = 1.52 ± 0.03 at phases around the flux maximum to Γ = 1.79 ± 0.06 around the flux minimum. Last, we compare our results with other pulsars whose magnetospheric emission is detected at hard X-ray energies and find that, similar to previous studies, J1617's hard X-ray properties are more similar to the MeV pulsars than the GeV pulsars."

This study aims to assess the capability of TROPOMI to acquire high spatial resolution data regarding surface NO2 mixing ratios. In general, the instrument effectively detected major and moderate sources of NO2 over South Korea with a clear weekday–weekend distinction. We compared the CTROPOMI with surface NO2 mixing ratio measurements from an extensive ground-based network over South Korea operated by the Korean Ministry of Environment (SKME; more than 570 sites), for 2019. Spatiotemporally collocated CTROPOMI and SKME showed a moderate correlation (correlation coefficient, r = 0.67), whereas their annual mean values at each site showed a higher correlation (r = 0.84). The CTROPOMI and SKME were well correlated around the Seoul metropolitan area, where significant amounts of NO2 prevailed throughout the year, whereas they showed lower correlation at rural sites. We converted the tropospheric NO2 from TROPOMI to the surface mixing ratio (STROPOMI) using the EAC4 (ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4) profile shape, for quantitative comparison with the SKME. The estimated STROPOMI generally underestimated the in-situ value obtained, SKME (slope = 0.64), as reported in previous studies."

Here we detail our modeling of the observed profile of PSR J0030+0451 that we analyzed in Miller et al. and Riley et al. and describe a cross-verification of computations of the pulse profiles of a star with R/M 3, in case stars this compact need to be considered in future analyses. We also present our early cross-verification efforts of the parameter estimation procedures used by Miller et al. and Riley et al. by analyzing two distinct synthetic data sets. Both codes yielded credible regions in the mass–radius plane that are statistically consistent with one another, and both gave posterior distributions for model parameter values consistent with the values that were used to generate the data. We also summarize the additional tests of the parameter estimation procedure of Miller et al. that used synthetic pulse profiles and the NICER pulse profile of PSR J0030+0451. We then illustrate how the precision of mass and radius estimates depends on the pulsar’s spin rate and the size of its hot spot by analyzing four different synthetic pulse profiles. Finally, we assess possible sources of systematic error in the estimates made using this technique, some of which may warrant further investigation."

The source flux increased for∼103safter the discovery, decayed rapidly over∼5 orders of magnitude in five days, and then remained almost constant over nine months. Large-amplitude short-term variations on timescales of 1–104s were observed throughout the decay. In the initial flux rise, the source showed a hard power-law-shaped spectrum with a photon index of∼1.0extending up to∼30 keV, above which an exponential cutoff was present. The photon index increased in the following rapid decay and became∼2 at the end of the decay. A spectral absorption feature at 3–4 keV was detected in the decay. It is not straightforward to explain all the observed properties by any known class of X-ray sources.

Few reports have analysed X-ray reflections from WDs. We recently developed an elaborate IP-reflection spectral model. Herein, we report the first application of a reflection model with an IP thermal model to the spectra of the brightest typical IP V1223 Sagittarii observed by the Suzaku and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array satellites. The model reasonably reproduces the spectra within the range of 5–78 keV and estimates the WD mass as 0.92 ± 0.02 Mꙩ. The WD mass estimated by the proposed model is consistent with that measured using an active galactic nucleus reflection model and a partial covering absorption model. However, the choice of incorrect parameter values, such as an unsuitable fitting energy band and an incorrect metal abundance, was found to introduce systematic errors (e.g. ≲0.2 Mꙩ in the WD mass) in the WD mass measurement. Our spin-phase-resolved analysis resulted in discoveries regarding the modulations of the equivalent width of the fluorescent iron K α line and the angle between the post-shock accretion column and the line of sight (viewing angle). The viewing angle anticorrelates approximately with the X-ray flux and has average and semi-amplitude values of 55° and 7°, respectively, which points towards two WD spin axis angles from the line of sight of 55° and 7°, respectively. Both estimated spin axis angles are different from the reported system inclination of 24°."

Transit events we initially detected during TESS Cycle 1 are validated with time-series photometry from Spitzer. High-contrast imaging and high-resolution, optical spectra are also obtained to characterize the stellar host and confirm the planetary nature of the transits. The host star is a late-F dwarf(Må=1.2Me)with a low-mass,M dwarf binary companion(Må=0.26Me)separated by nearly one arc minute(∼6200 au). Based on its rapid rotation and Lithium absorption, HD 110082 is young, but is not a member of any known group of young stars(despite proximity to the Octans association). To measure the age of the system, we search for coeval, phase-space neighbors and compile a sample of candidate siblings to compare with the empirical sequences of young clusters and to apply quantitative age-dating techniques. In doing so, we find that HD 110082 resides in a new young stellar association we designate MELANGE-1, with an age of -+ 2507050 Myr.

Using published photometry and spectroscopy as well as our own follow-up, we present an array of color–magnitude and color–color diagrams to further characterize census members, and we provide polynomial fits to the bulk trends. Using these characterizations, we assign each object a T(eff) value and judge sample completeness over bins of T(eff) and spectral type. Except for types ≥T8 and T(eff) < 600 K, our census is statistically complete to the 20 pc limit. We compare our measured space densities to simulated density distributions and find that the best fit is a power law (dN/dM ∝ M^(-α) with α = 0.6 ± 0.1. We find that the evolutionary models of Saumon & Marley correctly predict the observed magnitude of the space density spike seen at 1200 K < T(eff) < 1350 K, believed to be caused by an increase in the cooling timescale across the L/T transition.

The  patterns  in  precipitation, circulation, column water vapor, and cloudiness are consistent with the representation of marine shallow mesoscale convective 15 self-aggregation by large eddy simulations of the boundary layer. Although they occur under similar large-scale conditions, the suppressed and clustered low cloud types are found to be well-separated by variables associated with low-level mesoscale circulation,  with  surface  wind  divergence  being  the  clearest  discriminator  between  them, whether  reanalysis  or  satellite observations are used. Clustered regimes are associated with surface convergence and suppressed regimes are associated with surface divergence."

Although age dynamics might be more dominant in certain regions over others, demographic effects on net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) are bound to exist. Yet, explicit representation of ecosystem demography is notably absent in many global ecosystem models. This is concerning because the global community relies on these models to regularly update our collective understanding of the global carbon cycle. This paper aims to present the technical developments of a computationally efficient approach for representing age-class dynamics within a global ecosystem model, the Lund–Potsdam–Jena – Wald, Schnee, Landschaft version 2.0 (LPJ-wsl v2.0) dynamic global vegetation model and to determine if explicit representation of demography influenced ecosystem stocks and fluxes at global scales or at the level of a grid cell. The modeled age classes are initially created by simulated fire and prescribed wood harvesting or abandonment of managed land, otherwise aging naturally until an additional disturbance is simulated or prescribed. In this paper, we show that the age module can capture classic demographic patterns in stem density and tree height compared to inventory data, and that simulated patterns of ecosystem function follow classic responses with age. We also present two scientific applications of the model to assess the modeled age-class distribution over time and to determine the demographic effect on ecosystem fluxes relative to climate. Simulations show that, between 1860 and 2016, zonal age distribution on Earth was driven predominately by fire, causing a 45- to 60-year difference in ages between older boreal (50–90° N) and younger tropical (23° S–23° N) ecosystems. Between simulation years 1860 and 2016, land-use change and land management were responsible for a decrease in zonal age by −6 years in boreal and by −21 years in both temperate (23–50° N) and tropical latitudes, with the anthropogenic effect on zonal age distribution increasing over time. A statistical model helped to reduce LPJ-wsl v2.0 complexity by predicting per-grid-cell annual NPP and Rh fluxes by three terms: precipitation, temperature, and age class; at global scales, R2 was between 0.95 and 0.98. As determined by the statistical model, the demographic effect on ecosystem function was often less than 0.10 kg C/sq. myr but as high as 0.60 kg C/sq. myr where the effect was greatest. In the eastern forests of North America, the simulated demographic effect was of similar magnitude, or greater than, the effects of climate; simulated demographic effects were similarly important in large regions of every vegetated continent. Simulated spatial datasets are provided for global ecosystem ages and the estimated coefficients for effects of precipitation, temperature and demography on ecosystem function. The discussion focuses on our finding of an increasing role of demography in the global carbon cycle, the effect of demography on relaxation times (resilience) following a disturbance event and its implications at global scales, and a finding of a 40 Pg C increase in biomass turnover when including age dynamics at global scales. Whereas time is the only mechanism that increases ecosystem age, any additional disturbance not explicitly modeled will decrease age. The LPJ-wsl v2.0 age module represents another step forward towards understanding the role of demography in global ecosystems."

developed under the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change and advanced
most recently through the Paris Climate Agreement. In parallel, sub-national actors have set
greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals and developed corresponding climate mitigation plans.
Within the U.S., multi-state coalitions have formed to facilitate coordination of related science and
policy. Here, utilizing the forum of the NASA Carbon Monitoring System’s Multi-State Working
Group, we collected and reviewed climate mitigation plans for 11 states in the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative region of the Eastern U.S. For each state we reviewed the (a) policy
framework for climate mitigation, (b) GHG reduction goals, (c) inclusion of forest activities in the
state’s climate action plan, (d) existing science used to quantify forest carbon estimates, and (e)
stated needs for forest carbon monitoring science. Across the region, we found important
differences across all categories. While all states have GHG reduction goals and framework
documents, nearly three-quarters of all states do not account for forest carbon when planning
GHG reductions; those that do account for forest carbon use a variety of scientific methods with
various levels of planning detail and guidance. We suggest that a common, efficient, standardized
forest carbon monitoring system would provide important benefits to states and the geographic
region as a whole. In addition, such a system would allow for more effective transparency and
progress tracking to support state, national, and international efforts to increase ambition and
implementation of climate goals."

This is a challenge for UAS that are limited in size, weight and computational power, such as small rotorcrafts executing autonomous missions on Earth, or in planetary applications such as the Mars Helicopter. For such a computationally constraint system, we propose a structure from motion approach that uses inputs from a single downward facing camera to produce dense point clouds of the overflown terrain in real time. In contrast to existing approaches, our method uses metric pose information from a visual-inertial odometry algorithm as camera pose priors, which allows deploying a fast pose refinement step to align camera frames such that a conventional stereo algorithm can be used for dense 3D reconstruction. We validate the performance of our approach with extensive evaluations in simulation, and demonstrate the feasibility with data from UAS flights."

Our Assurance Case addresses the concern that optical communication may be interrupted by the presence of cloud cover, threatening the success of the demonstration. Central to our Assurance Case is its use of a model of atmospheric attenuation to support a key portion of the robustness argument. The conclusion for the demonstration is that its schedule slack plus ability to store data for transmission later accommodates occasional weather-caused atmospheric attenuation.We indicate how the overall structure of the Assurance Case derives from the Objectives Hierarchy set forth in the NASA Reliability and Maintainability standard. We then present the portions of the Assurance Case that argue (1) the atmospheric attenuation model is sufficiently accurate, (2) application of the model shows the desired robustness of the demonstration, and (3) all the model assumptions are satisfied in its application. Lastly, we suggest how an engineering model of the demonstration system and its use could inform the development of the Assurance Case encompassing additional plausible hazards."

By imaging and determining the location of decametric-hectometric (DH) radio bursts from 0.1 MHz–25 MHz, SunRISE will provide key information on particle acceleration mechanisms associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the magnetic field topology from active regions into interplanetary space. Six small spacecraft, of a 6U form factor, will fly in a supersynchronous geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) orbit within about 10 km of each other, in a passive formation, and image the Sun in a portion of the spectrum that is blocked by the ionosphere and cannot be observed from Earth. Key aspects that enable this mission are that only position knowledge of the spacecraft is required, not active control, and that the architecture involves a modest amount of on-board processing coupled with significant ground-based processing for navigation, position determination, and science operations. Mission-enabling advances in software-defined radios, GPS navigation and timing, and small spacecraft technologies, developed and flown on the DARPA High Frequency Research (DHFR), the Community Initiative for Continuing Earth Radio Occultation (CICERO), and the Mars Cube One (MarCO) missions, have made this mission affordable and low-risk.

Generated by internal dynamos, magnetic fields are one of the few remote sensing means of constraining the properties of planetary interiors. For the Earth, its magnetic field has been speculated to be par- tially responsible for its habitability, and knowledge of an extrasolar planet’s magnetic field may be necessary to as- sess its habitability. The radio emission from Jupiter and other solar system planets is produced by an electron cy- clotron maser, and detections of extrasolar planetary elec- tron cyclotron masers will enable measurements of extraso- lar planetary magnetic fields.

In this study, we simulate Rn-222 using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to improve our understanding of Rn-222 emissions and surface concentration seasonality and characterize convective transport associated with two Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) meteorological products, the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and GEOS Forward Processing (GEOS-FP). We evaluate four global Rn-222 emission scenarios by comparing model results with observations at 51 surface sites. The default emission scenario in GEOS-Chem yields a moderate agreement with surface observations globally (68.9 % of data within a factor of 2) and a large underestimate of winter surface Rn-222 concentrations at Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and high latitudes due to an oversimplified formulation of Rn-222 emission fluxes (1 atom cm−2 s−1 over land with a reduction by a factor of 3 under freezing conditions). We compose a new global Rn-222 emission scenario based on Zhang et al. (2011) and demonstrate its potential to improve simulated surface Rn-222 concentrations and seasonality. The regional components of this scenario include spatially and temporally varying emission fluxes derived from previous measurements of soil radium content and soil exhalation models, which are key factors in determining Rn-222 emission flux rates. However, large model underestimates of surface Rn-222 concentrations still exist in Asia, suggesting unusually high regional Rn-222 emissions. We therefore propose a conservative upscaling factor of 1.2 for Rn-222 emission fluxes in China, which was also constrained by observed deposition fluxes of 210Pb (a progeny of Rn-222). With this modification, the model shows better agreement with observations in Europe and North America (> 80 % of data within a factor of 2) and reasonable agreement in Asia (close to 70 %). Further constraints on Rn-222 emissions would require additional concentration and emission flux observations in the central United States, Canada, Africa, and Asia. We also compare and assess convective transport in model simulations driven by MERRA and GEOS-FP using observed Rn-222 vertical profiles in northern midlatitude summer and from three short-term airborne campaigns. While simulations with both GEOS products are able to capture the observed vertical gradient of Rn-222 concentrations in the lower troposphere (0–4 km), neither correctly represents the level of convective detrainment, resulting in biases in the middle and upper troposphere. Compared with GEOS-FP, MERRA leads to stronger convective transport of Rn-222, which is partially compensated for by its weaker large-scale vertical advection, resulting in similar global vertical distributions of Rn-222 concentrations between the two simulations. This has important implications for using chemical transport models to interpret the transport of other trace species when these GEOS products are used as driving meteorology."

Turbulence and Dust–Gas Dynamics at Non-Linear Saturation,"The streaming instability is a fundamental process that can drive dust–gas dynamics and ultimately planetesimal formation inprotoplanetary discs. As a linear instability, it has been shown that its growth with a distribution of dust sizes can be classifiedinto two distinct regimes, fast- and slow-growth, depending on the dust-size distribution and the total dust-to-gas density ratio. Using numerical simulations of an unstratified disc, we bring three cases in different regimes into non-linear saturation. Wefind that the saturation states of the two fast-growth cases are similar to its single-species counterparts. The one with maximumdimensionless stopping timeτs,max=0.1 and=2 drives turbulent vertical dust–gas vortices, while the other withτs,max=2and=0.2 leads to radial traffic jams and filamentary structures of dust particles. The dust density distribution for the former isflat in low densities, while the one for the latter has a low-end cut-off. By contrast, the one slow-growth case results in a virtuallyquiescent state. Moreover, we find that in the fast-growth regime, significant dust segregation by size occurs, with large particlesmoving towards dense regions while small particles remain in the diffuse regions, and the mean radial drift of each dust speciesis appreciably altered from the (initial) drag-force equilibrium. The former effect may skew the spectral index derived frommultiwavelength observations and change the initial size distribution of a pebble cloud for planetesimal formation. The latteralong with turbulent diffusion may influence the radial transport and mixing of solid materials in young protoplanetary discs."

We show that the persistent emission can be modeled as an absorbed, Comptonized blackbody in addition to Fe Kα emission, which can be attributed to relativistic disk reflection. We measure a persistent bolometric, unabsorbed luminosity of L(bol) = 7.03(+0.04, -0.05) x 10^(36) erg/s, assuming a distance of 7 kpc, corresponding to an Eddington ratio of 4.5%. This persistent luminosity combined with light-curve analysis leads us to infer that the bursts were the result of pure He burning rather than mixed H/He burning. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the bolometric flux of the first burst exhibits a double-peaked structure, placing the source within a small population of accreting NSs that exhibit multiple-peaked type-I X-ray bursts. We find that the second, brighter burst shows evidence for photospheric radius expansion (PRE) and that at its peak, this PRE event had an unabsorbed bolometric flux of F(peak)= 2.94 (+0.28, -0.26) 10^(-8) erg/sq.cm s. This yields a new distance estimate of d = 9.0 ± 0.5 kpc, assuming that this corresponds to the Eddington limit for pure He burning on the surface of a canonical NS. Additionally, we performed a detailed timing analysis that failed to find evidence for quasi-periodic oscillations or burst oscillations, and we place an upper limit of 16% on the rms variability around 589 Hz, the frequency at which oscillations have previously been reported."

SuperCam LIBS spectra are preprocessed to remove ambient light, noise, and the continuum signal present in LIBS observations. Prior to quantification, spectra are masked to remove noisier spectrometer regions andspectra are normalized to minimize signal fluctuations and effectsof target distance.In some cases, the spectra are also standardized or binned prior to quantification. To determine quantitative elemental compositionsof diverse geologic materials at Jezero crater, Mars, we use a suite of 1198 laboratory spectra of 334 well-characterized reference samples. The samples were selected to span a wide range of compositions and include typical silicate rocks, pure minerals (e.g.,silicates, sulfates, carbonates, oxides),more unusual compositions (e.g.,Mn oreand sodalite), andreplicates of the sintered SuperCam calibration targets (SCCTs) onboardthe rover. For each major element (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), the database was subdivided into five“folds” with similar distributions of the element of interest. One fold was held out as an independent test set, and the remaining fourfolds were used to optimize multivariate regression models relating the spectrum to the composition. We considered a variety of models, and selected several for further investigation for each element, based primarily on the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) on the test set, when analyzed at 3m. In cases with several models of comparable performance at 3 m, we incorporated the SCCT performance at different distances to choose the preferred model. Shortly after landing on Mars and collecting initial spectra of geologic targets, we selected one model per element. Subsequently, with additional data from geologic targets, some models were revised to ensure results that are more consistent with geochemical constraints. The calibration discussed here is a snapshot of an ongoing effort to deliver the most accurate chemical compositions with SuperCam LIBS."

We revisit Vela X-1 with two new observations taken with NuSTAR at orbital phases ∼0.68–0.78 and ∼0.36–0.52, which show a plethora of variability and allow us to study the accretion geometry and stellar wind properties of the system. We follow the evolution of spectral parameters down to the pulse period timescale using a partially covered power law continuum with a Fermi-Dirac cutoff to model the continuum and local absorption. We are able to confirm anti-correlations between the photon index and the luminosity and, for low fluxes, between the folding energy and the luminosity, implying a change of properties in the Comptonising plasma. We were not able to
confirm a previously seen correlation between the cyclotron line energy and the luminosity of the source in the overall observation, but we observed a drop in the cyclotron line energy following a strong flare. We see strong variability in absorption between the two observations and within one observation (for the ∼0.36–0.52 orbital phases) that can be explained by the presence of a large-scale structure, such as accretion and photoionisation wakes in the system, and our variable line of sight through this structure."

Trained support vector machines serve as the observation operator and map the geophysical modeled variables into ΔT b space within the assimilation framework. Evaluation of the assimilation routine is carried out through comparison of assimilated snow mass estimates with an in situ dataset. The assimilation framework helps improve the land surface model estimates through PMW ΔT b assimilation, particularly in terms of decreasing the domain-wide bias. The assimilation framework proved more effective during the (dry) snow accumulation season and decreased the bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) in snow mass estimates at 76% and 58% of the comparative pixels, respectively. During the snow ablation season, the PMW brightness temperature signal contained less information related to snow mass due to the presence of other concurrent geophysical features that effectively serve as noise during the snow mass update. The utilization of PMW ΔT b for accurate snow mass estimation in complex terrain such as HMA is dependent on a multitude of factors for optimal results; however, it does add utility to the land surface model if the relevant pitfalls are taken into consideration prior to the state variable update."

range of environmental gradient. Although several studies have reported an increase in plant water stress and mortality, the spatiotemporal variations of ecosystem productivity responses and the associated environmental and biological drivers remain unclear. Here, using Enhanced Vegetation Index from the Moderate resolution imaging spectrometer, we found that 45% of the natural ecosystems showed an abrupt change (breakpoint [BP]) in productivity during 2012–2016. There were three major contrasting temporal patterns of productivity responses: (i) a steady increase under higher temperature followed by a decline due to accumulated moisture depletion (high elevation forest) or temperature decrease (high elevation nonforest), (ii) gradual decline during the drought followed by a rapid recovery within 1 year after drought stress was partially relieved, and (iii) both a gradual decline and an abrupt decline. The magnitude of abrupt changes was negatively correlated (r = −0.80, p < 0.001) with initial gradual changes. Overall, changes during BP offset, on average, 57% of the preceding gradual responses. The spatial variability in ecosystem response patterns is driven by both environmental and biological factors. Particularly, for forests, positive BP was driven by increasing rainfall and decreasing temperature, while negative BP was mainly driven by the precipitation anomaly. By 2019, 33% of the natural vegetation have recovered to the level of EVI in 2010. Ecosystem responses to multiyear droughts can influence ecosystem dynamics in a complex pattern. Multiple ecohydrological factors should be considered to understand and predict the long-term drought impacts on ecosystems."

These ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems can store large amounts of carbon for long periods, and their protection reduces greenhouse gas emissions and supports climate change mitigation. Incorporating mangroves into Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and their valuation on carbon markets requires predicting how the management of different land-uses can prevent future greenhouse gas emissions and increase CO2 sequestration. We integrated comprehensive global datasets for carbon stocks, mangrove distribution, deforestation rates, and land-use change drivers into a predictive model of mangrove carbon emissions. We project emissions and foregone soil carbon sequestration potential under ‘business as usual’ rates of mangrove loss. Emissions from mangrove loss could reach 2391 Tg CO2 eq by the end of the century, or 3392 Tg CO2 eq when considering foregone soil carbon sequestration. The highest emissions were predicted in southeast and south Asia (West Coral Triangle, Sunda Shelf, and the Bay of Bengal) due to conversion to aquaculture or agriculture, followed by the Caribbean (Tropical Northwest Atlantic) due to clearing and erosion, and the Andaman coast (West Myanmar) and north Brazil due to erosion. Together, these six regions accounted for 90% of the total potential CO2 eq future emissions. Mangrove loss has been slowing, and global emissions could be more than halved if reduced loss rates remain in the future. Notably, the location of global emission hotspots was consistent with every dataset used to calculate deforestation rates or with alternative assumptions about carbon storage and emissions. Our results indicate the regions in need of policy actions to address emissions arising from mangrove loss and the drivers that could be managed to prevent them."

This paper presents fourteen years (2005-2018) assessment of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution from MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites to ascertain the Spatio-temporal and seasonal distribution of aerosols over Ghana and its major cities. The MODIS AOD at 3 km were validated against ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AODs to ascertain the suitability of the MODIS 3 km data for air quality application in the region. The contribution of distant aerosols to city aerosol loadings was also assessed with Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) backscatter model. A moderate-high aerosol burden (AODs ~ 0.50) was observed over Ghana with a significant contribution from the pre-monsoon season. City centres of Takoradi and Kumasi showed higher aerosol loads (AODs ~ 0.80) than Accra and Tamale. The HYSPLIT model showed that distant or transported aerosol sources to the city centres were of both marine and land generated origins. Linear regression analysis between MODIS AOD and AERONET AOD showed a reasonably good correlation of ~ 0.60 for Aqua and Terra. From the validation analysis, both Aqua and Terra satellites can be used for air quality monitoring over Ghana; however, more ground research must be conducted to ascertain better aerosol model assumptions for the region."

Understanding the role of fire in global forest loss is crucial in constraining land-use change emissions and the global carbon cycle. We analysed the relationship between forest loss and fire at 500 m resolution based on satellite-derived data for the 2003–2018 period. Satellite fire data included burned area and active fire detections, to best account for large and small fires, respectively. We found that, on average, 38 ± 9% (± range) of global forest loss was associated with fire, and this fraction remained relatively stable throughout the study period. However, the fraction of fire-related forest loss varied substantially on a regional basis, and showed statistically significant trends in key tropical forest areas. Decreases in the fraction of fire-related forest loss were found where deforestation peaked early in our study period, including the Amazon and Indonesia while increases were found for tropical forests in Africa. The inclusion of active fire detections accounted for 41%, on average, of the total fire-related forest loss, with larger contributions in small clearings in interior tropical forests and human-dominated landscapes. Comparison to higher-resolution fire data with resolutions of 375 and 20 m indicated that commission errors due to coarse resolution fire data largely balanced out omission errors due to missed small fire detections for regional to continental-scale estimates of fire-related forest loss. Besides an improved understanding of forest dynamics, these findings may help to refine and separate fire-related and non-fire-related land-use change emissions in forested ecosystems."

The MDXR also includes an absolute cryogenic radiometer (ACR) and a Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS). For irradiance measurements, the ACR is used to provide the primary power scale for the BIB detector in conjunction with spectral filters, whereas the FTS/BIB configuration derives its scale from an internal blackbody source. The two measurement scales show agreement for the irradiance of highly collimated (<1  mrad) IR beams from 10<sup>-13</sup>  to 10<sup>-8</sup>  W / μm / cm<sup>2</sup> within the combined relative uncertainties of 2.6% (coverage factor k = 1.) We have also calibrated the radiometer for radiance measurements using a large cavity fluid bath blackbody that overfills the spatial and angular extent of the radiometer entrance pupil. The radiometric calibration uncertainty analysis of the radiometer and its maintenance and stability are discussed."

We conducted a PRISMA-adherent systematic review of the published and grey literature to identify potential arthropod vectors and non-human animal reservoirs of MAYV. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, SciELO and grey-literature sources including PAHO databases and dissertation repositories. Studies
were included if they assessed MAYV virological/immunological measured occurrence in field-caught, domestic, or sentinel animals or in field-caught arthropods. We conducted an animal seroprevalence meta-analysis using a random effects model. We compiled granular georeferenced maps of non-human MAYV occurrence and graded the quality of the studies using a customized framework. Overall, 57 studies were eligible out of 1523 screened, published between the years 1961 and 2020. Seventeen studies reported MAYV positivity in wild mammals, birds, or reptiles and five studies reported MAYV positivity in domestic animals. MAYV positivity was reported in 12 orders of wild-caught vertebrates, most frequently in the orders Charadriiformes and Primate. Sixteen studies detected MAYV in wild-caught mosquito genera including Haemagogus, Aedes, Culex, Psorophora, Coquillettidia, and Sabethes. Vertebrate animals or arthropods with MAYV were detected in Brazil, Panama, Peru, French Guiana, Colombia, Trinidad, Venezuela, Argentina, and Paraguay. Among non-human vertebrates, the Primate order had the highest pooled seroprevalence"

Detection of beetle infestation is a forest health monitoring (FHM) priority but is hampered by the challenges of detecting early stage (“green”) attack from the air. There is indication that green stage might be detected from vertical gradients of spectral data or from shortwave infrared information distributed within a single crown. To evaluate the efficacy of discriminating “non-infested”, “green”, and “dead” health statuses at the landscape scale in Alaska, USA, this study conducted spectral and structural fusion of data from: (1) Unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral (6 cm) + structure from motion point clouds (~700 pts per sq. m); and (2) Goddard Lidar Hyperspectral Thermal (G-LiHT) hyperspectral (400 to 1000 nm, 0.5 m) + SWIR-band lidar (~32 pts per sq.m). We achieved 78% accuracy for all three health statuses using spectral + structural fusion from either UAV or G-LiHT and 97% accuracy for non-infested/dead using G-LiHT. We confirm that UAV 3D spectral (e.g., greenness above versus below median height in crown) and lidar apparent reflectance metrics (e.g., mean reflectance at 99th percentile height in crown), are of high value, perhaps capturing the vertical gradient of needle degradation. In most classification exercises, UAV accuracy was lower than G-LiHT indicating that collecting ultra-high spatial resolution data might be less important than high spectral resolution information. While the value of passive optical spectral information was largely confined to the discrimination of non-infested versus dead crowns, G-LiHT hyperspectral band selection (~400, 675, 755, and 940 nm) could inform future FHM mission planning regarding optimal wavelengths for this task. Interestingly, the selected regions mostly did not align with the band designations for our UAV multispectral data but do correspond to, e.g., Sentinel-2 red edge bands, suggesting a path forward for moderate scale bark beetle detection when paired with suitable structural data."

To improve this understanding, we integrated a gridded crop model with satellite observations, recharge estimates, and water survey data to assess the effects of sustainable groundwater withdrawals on US irrigated agricultural production. The gridded crop model agrees with satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration (R2 = 0.68), as well as survey data from the United States Department of Agriculture (R2 = 0.82–0.94 for county-level production and 0.37–0.54 for county-level yield). Using the optimistic assumption that groundwater extraction equals effective aquifer recharge rate, we find that sustainable groundwater use decreases US irrigated production of maize, soybean, and winter wheat by 20%, 6%, and 25%, respectively. Using a more conservative assumption of groundwater availability, US irrigated production of maize, soybean, and winter wheat decreases by 45%, 37%, and 36%, respectively. The wide range of simulated losses is driven by considerable uncertainty in surface water and groundwater interactions, as well as accounting for the many aspects of sustainability. Our results demonstrate the vulnerability of US irrigated agriculture to unsustainable groundwater pumping, highlighting the difficulty of expanding or even maintaining irrigated food production in the face of climate change, population growth, and shifting dietary demands. These findings are based on reducing pumping by fallowing irrigated farmland; however, alternate pumping reduction strategies or technological advances in crop genetics and irrigation could produce different results."

Overview: CO Cloud Distributions,"We have analyzed the data from a large-scale CO survey toward the northern region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) obtained with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) stand-alone mode of ALMA. The primary aim of this study is to comprehensively understand the behavior of CO as an H2 tracer in a low-metallicity environment (Z ∼ 0.2 Zꙩ). The total number of mosaic fields is ∼8000, which results in a field coverage of 0.26 sq.deg (∼2.9 ×10^(5) sq.pc), corresponding to ∼10% of the area of the galaxy. The sensitive ∼2 pc resolution observations reveal the detailed structure of the molecular clouds previously detected in the single-dish NANTEN survey. We have detected a number of compact CO clouds within lower H2 column density (∼10^(20) per sq.cm) regions whose angular scale is similar to the ACA beam size. Most of the clouds in this survey also show peak brightness temperature as low as <1 K, which for optically thick CO emission implies an emission size much smaller than the beam size, leading to beam dilution. The comparison between an available estimation of the total molecular material traced by thermal dust emission and the present CO survey demonstrates that more than ∼90% of H(2) gas cannot be traced by the low-J CO emission. Our processed data cubes and 2D images are publicly available."

OGLE-2019-BLG-1053Lb, a BuriedTerrestrial Planet","In order to exhume the buried signatures of “missing planetary caustics” in Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) data, we conducted a systematic anomaly search of the residuals from point-source point-lens fits, based on a modified version of the KMTNet Event Finder algorithm. This search revealed the lowest-mass-ratio planetary caustic to date in the microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-1053, for which the planetary signal had not been noticed before. The planetary system has a planet–host mass ratio ofq= (1.25±0.13) × 10−5. A Bayesian analysis yielded estimates of the mass of the host star, Mhost =-0.61+0.29 -0.24 Mo, the mass of its planet, Mplanet =-2.48 +1.19 -0.98 Mo, the projected planet – host separation, a^= 3.4 +0.5/-0.5 au, and the lens distance, DL =-6.8 +0.6 -0.90kpc.The discovery of this very-low-mass-ratio planet illustrates the utility of our method and opens a new window for a large and homogeneous sample to study the microlensing planet–host mass ratio function down to q∼ 10−5."

Although there is substantial uncertainty in the satellite parallax measured by Spitzer, the measurement of the annual parallax effect combined with the finite source effect allows us to determine the mass of the host star (M(L) = 0.3–0.6 Mꙩ), the mass of its planet (m(p) = 1.4–3.1 Mꚛ), the projected separation between the host and planet (a(⊥) = 1.2–2.3 au), and the distance to the lens system (D(L) = 0.6–1.2 kpc). The lens is plausibly the blend, which could be checked with adaptive optics observations. As the smallest planet clearly below the break in the mass-ratio function, it demonstrates that current experiments are powerful enough to robustly measure the slope of the mass-ratio function below that break. We find that the cross-section for detecting small planets is maximized for planets with separations just outside of the boundary for resonant caustics and that sensitivity to such planets can be maximized by intensively monitoring events whenever they are magnified by a factor A > 5. Finally, an empirical investigation demonstrates that most planets showing a degeneracy between (s > 1) and (s < 1) solutions are not in the regime (|log s| ≫ 0) for which the ""close""/""wide"" degeneracy was derived. This investigation suggests that there is a link between the ""close""/""wide"" and ""inner/outer"" degeneracies and also that the symmetry in the lens equation goes much deeper than symmetries uncovered for the limiting cases."

The transiting planet is confirmed using high-resolution optical transmission spectra from EXPRES. It is inflated, with Rp = 1.875 ± 0.053 RJ, and exhibits several interesting properties, including a misaligned orbit (240.34 (+0.93, -0.98) degrees) and nearly grazing transit (b=0.9036 (+0.0061, -0.0053)). The planet orbits a fast-rotating F0 host star (Teff ≃ 7300 K) in 1.9 days and experiences intense irradiation. Notably, the TESS data show a clear secondary eclipse with a depth of 364 ± 28 ppm and a significant phase-curve signal, from which we obtain a relative day–night planetary flux difference of roughly 320 ppm and a 5.2σ detection of ellipsoidal distortion on the host star. Prompted by recent detections of atomic and ionized species in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres, we conduct an atmospheric cross-correlation analysis. We detect neutral iron (5.2σ), at K(p) = 157 (+68, -44) km/s and V(sys) = -16 (+2, -4), adding another object to the small sample of highly irradiated gas-giant planets with Fe detections in transmission. Detections so far favor particularly inflated gas giants with radii ≳1.78 R(J), which may be due to observational bias. With an equilibrium temperature of T(eq) = 2492 ± 38 K and a measured dayside brightness temperature of 3237 ± 59 K (assuming zero geometric albedo), TOI-1518b is a promising candidate for future emission spectroscopy to probe for a thermal inversion."

Accuracy could be improved by adding measurements at lower frequencies (lower than the measurement at 1.4 GHz currently used) and closer to the peak in sensitivity of brightness temperature to changes in salinity. Proposals to accomplish this have focused on wide bandwidth receivers which include at the low end frequencies close to the peak in sensitivity. This strategy involves trade-offs, some obvious such as radio frequency interference (RFI) when operating outside the protected band at 1.4 GHz and the loss of spatial resolution at lower frequencies. Others stemming from the interdependence of the retrieval of salinity on water temperature and surface roughness are more subtle. The objective of this manuscript is to examine this interdependence and its implications to future wide bandwidth instruments for remote sensing of salinity from space."

This secular maximum is the longest in the last 9300 years. Since the end of solar cycle 21 (SC21), however, the Sun has shown a decline in over-all activity, which has remarkably increased the fluxes of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). Here, we investigate the correlation between the modulation of GCRs, the heliospheric magnetic field, and solar wind speed for the last 24 solar cycles to find trends that can potentially be used to predict future solar activity.  Specifically, we develop a tool for predicting future magnetic field intensity, based on the hysteresis in the GCR variation, during the last phases of the current cycle. This method estimates that SC25 will be as weak as or weaker than SC24. This would mean that the Sun has likely entered a secular minimum, which, according to historical records, should last for another two cycles (SC2527and SC26)."

Our search comprises 184 total planetary systems with confirmed hot Jupiters with Rp > 8 R⊕ and orbital period <10 days. The Transit Least Squares algorithm was utilized to search for periodic signals that may have been missed by other planet search pipelines. While we recovered 169 of these confirmed hot Jupiters, our search yielded no new statistically validated planetary candidates in the parameter space searched (P < 14 days). A lack of planet candidates nearby hot Jupiters in the TESS data supports results from previous transit searches of each individual system, now down to the photometric precision of TESS. This is consistent with expectations from a high-eccentricity migration formation scenario, but additional formation indicators are needed for definitive confirmation. We injected transit signals into the light curves of the hot Jupiter sample to probe the pipeline's sensitivity to the target parameter space, finding a dependence proportional to ${R}_{p}^{2.32}{P}^{-0.88}$ for planets within 0.3 ≤ Rp ≤ 4 R⊕ and 1 ≤ P ≤ 14 days. A statistical analysis accounting for this sensitivity provides a median and 90% confidence interval of ${7.3}_{-7.3}^{+15.2} \% $ for the rate of hot Jupiters with nearby companions in this target parameter space. This study demonstrates how TESS uniquely enables comprehensive searches for nearby planetary companions to nearly all the known hot Jupiters."

A need to evolve NASA’s S&MS assurance framework has emerged in recent years, resulting from the need to accommodate new acquisition models; the need to accommodate evolving systems engineering (SE) practices; the need to stipulate acceptable levels of S&MS risk; the need for improved integration of S&MS into SE; and the need for clearer risk acceptance accountability. The objectives-driven, case-based S&MS assurance framework proposed here is responsive to that need. Its key features include:

•	The establishment, by NASA Acquirers, of fundamental S&MS performance objectives that define limits of acceptability for the likelihoods that mission technical objectives will be accomplished and that people, assets, and environments put at risk by the mission will not be adversely affected;
•	The development and approval of Providers’ S&MS plans for meeting Acquirers’ S&MS performance objectives, including commitments to support Acquirer audit, investigation, and reporting needs;
•	The development, by Providers, of S&MS assurance cases that argue, supported by evidence, that the Provider has met, or is on track to meeting, the fundamental S&MS objectives;
•	The evaluation, throughout the program/project life cycle, of Provider S&MS assurance cases as the primary S&MS-related technical basis for Acquirer risk acceptance and the granting to the Provider of authority to proceed through the program/project life cycle.

This proposed S&MS assurance framework is notable for its lack of prescription of traditional S&MS requirements and strategies such as defined failure tolerances, margins, or analysis requirements. Instead, Providers are given latitude to propose their own strategies for meeting the fundamental S&MS performance objectives, subject to independent review and Acquirer approval. The result is a framework for S&MS assurance that is at once both rigorous and flexible."

Ascending groundwater charged with carbon dioxide and,especially,hydrogen sulfide,can readily dissolve carbonate bedrock just below and above the water table. Sulfuric acid speleogenesis, in which anoxic, rising, sulfidic groundwater mixes with oxygenated cave atmosphere to form aggressive sulfuric acid (H2SO4), formed spectacular caves in CarlsbadCaverns National Park. Cueva de Villa Luz in Mexico provides an aggressively active example of sulfuric acid speleogenesisprocesses, and the Frasassi Caves in Italy preserve the results of sulfuric acid speleogenesis in its upper levels while sulfidic groundwater currently enlarges cave passages in the lower levels.
Manycaves in east-central Nevada and western Utah are products of hypogenic speleogenesis and formed before the current topography fully developed. Wet climate during the late Neogeneand Pleistocene brought extensive meteoric infiltration into the caves and calcite speleothems (e.g., stalactites, stalagmites, shields) coat the walls and floors of the caves, concealing evidence of the earlier hypogenic stage. However, by studying the speleogenetic features in well-established sulfuric acid speleogenesis caves, evidence ofhypogenic, probably sulfidic, speleogenesis inmany Great Basin caves can be teased out.Compelling evidence of hypogenicspeleogenesis in these cavesinclude folia, mammillaries, bubble trails, cupolas, and metatyuyamunite. Sulfuric acid speleogenesis signsinclude hollowcoralloidstalagmites,trays, gypsum crust, pseudoscallops, rills, and acid pool notches. Lehman Caves is particularly informative as a low-permeability capstone protected about half of the cave from significant meteoric infiltration, preserving early speleogeneticfeatures."

Here, we decompose the global budget into 19 regions (18 land and 1 oceanic) and five key source sectors to spatially attribute the observed global trends. A comparison of top-down (TD) (atmospheric and transport model-based) and bottom-up (BU) (inventory- and process model-based) CH4 emission estimates demonstrates robust temporal trends with CH4 emissions increasing in 16 of the 19 regions. Five regions—China, Southeast Asia, USA, South Asia, and Brazil—account for >40% of the global total emissions (their anthropogenic and natural sources together totaling >270 Tg CH4 yr−1 in 2008–2017). Two of these regions, China and South Asia, emit predominantly anthropogenic emissions (>75%) and together emit more than 25% of global anthropogenic emissions. China and the Middle East show the largest increases in total emission rates over the 2000 to 2017 period with regional emissions increasing by >20%. In contrast, Europe and Korea and Japan show a steady decline in CH4 emission rates, with total emissions decreasing by ~10% between 2000 and 2017. Coal mining, waste (predominantly solid waste disposal) and livestock (especially enteric fermentation) are dominant drivers of observed emissions increases while declines appear driven by a combination of waste and fossil emission reductions. As such, together these sectors present the greatest risks of further increasing the atmospheric CH4 burden and the greatest opportunities for greenhouse gas abatement."

Post Jupiter-Orbit-Insertion, the spacecraft will be commanded to perform intricate, yet meticulously planned Europa flybys to perform science investigations using a suite of instruments, while withstanding Jupiter’s harsh radiation environment. The success of this mission is dependent on a well-coordinated project and its elements such as the flight hardware and software, the ground support and mission operations teams, procedures and other cross-cutting elements. The Europa Clipper project needs to ensure that these elements are realized at a reasonable confidence level prior to launch and other mission critical events. System Validation test and analysis activities exercise and confirm the integrity of the system of all project elements in the expected flight environment with reasonable stressing conditions. These activities go beyond system design requirements verification and are driven by validation objectives that describe the end-to-end functional and operational capabilities required during nominal and off-nominal flight-like scenarios and critical events. The challenges associated with validating that the Europa Clipper project as a whole can function and perform correctly to meet the intended mission objectives with the as-delivered capabilities of all of its elements are daunting. This paper discusses the systematic methodology established in the early implementation phase of the Europa Clipper project for developing System Validation activities and their validation objectives, and addressing any validation-related challenges on the project. Approaches include decomposition of mission objectives using activity timelines in the Mission Design plan for developing nominal scenarios, use of fault trees for exploring off-nominal cases and system boundaries, and use of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools for planning and prioritizing these activities."

The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine how the Moon’s resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cost of VIPER’s rover software is challenging and complex.For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rover’s software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than on-board the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rover’s software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source, rather than following traditional (spiral, waterfall, etc.) development methods and in-house code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPER’s rover software. We first describe how we modeled the architecture and code counts for three software elements: Rover Flight Software (RFSW), Rover Ground Software (RGSW), and Rover Simulation Software (RSIM). We then discuss key challenges and unique aspects of our approach, such as the lack of Lunar rover analogies, the need to integrate and test large open source software, and the strategies developed to account for use of non-space flight management practices and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conclude with a summary of our results, including cumulative distribution, nearest neighbors and cluster analysis, as well as heuristics used to confirm the reasonableness of the cost estimate."

Two robotic arms are used by SCS: the large Robotic Arm (RA) positions the coring drill and science instruments mounted to the Turret for surface interactions, and the smaller Sample Handling Assembly (SHA) manipulates Sample Tube Assemblies (STA) within the Adaptive Caching Assembly (ACA) to prepare them for sample collection, processing, and hermetic sealing. The robotic arms interact with the Martian surface and other SCS components in many ways and in a variety of configurations, with positioning accuracy requirements ranging from tens of millimeters for some surface interactions down to sub-millimeter accuracy for some ACA interactions.This paper describes the process and tool used to calculate the SCS robotic interaction positioning budgets and verify the as-built hardware when delivered. To ensure that these robotic systems are able to perform their tasks, each robotic interaction with another element was broken down into its composite functions. To calculate a positioning budget margin for each function, an allowable was defined and then compared to the list of error sources that contribute to misalignment. Across the subsystem, over 250 functions were identified to be assessed, with almost 500 error sources feeding into their budget calculations. In addition to using as-built values in the budgets for SCS Verification and Validation (V&V) after the hardware was complete, these budgets were populated with design data during the design phase to identify areas of concern and guide hardware design to ensure positive position budget margins.Because of the size of the SCS team that had inputs to the positioning budgets and the sheer number of items in the budgets that needed to be created, updated, and verified, having a tool that would allow for simultaneous access and robust data integrity and processing was imperative. To accomplish this, a web-based MySQL database was created that allowed users to create function position budgets, link individual errors and allowables to them, and view function position budget margin reports. Each error and allowable records data for lateral, normal, angular, and clocking errors, with the ability to add as-built data for up to four different hardware builds. Margin reports can be generated for either design values alone or replacing design data with as-built data when available. These as-built reports are used for final verification of the SCS positioning requirements. Ultimately, the SCS positioning budget process and database tool led to successful interactions during test and an SCS robotic system that is ready to perform sample acquisition and caching on the surface of Mars."

These links are susceptible to non linear effects (e.g. cloud coverage, atmospheric turbulence, scintillation, antenna mis-pointing, jitter, relative motion, etc.) that cause various degrees of fading loss over various time scales. We consider a channel experiencing block fading where the channel coherence time is a lot longer than the length of a codeword. As long as the fading duration is not excessive, an interleaver can be used in a coded-communication system that randomizes the fades among symbols of multiple codewords. This achieves an “averaging” effect that spreads the signal energy more evenly among the codewords, and improves the likelihood that each of them can be decoded correctly. For simplicity, we consider a block interleaver where adjacent symbols of a codeword have a fixed delay (or separation) with each other, and investigate the error-rate performance of a coded-interleaving system (with fixed and finite interleaving depth) in the presence of block fading. Unlike prior research which assumes theoretical channel coherence models, we aim to build upon our analysis using empirical spacecraft signal measurements obtained with the Deep Space Network, and to use the fundamental theories of probability and statistics (e.g. variations of Law of Large Numbers) to quantify the error-rate performance of the coded-interleaving system. We propose to utilize these results in the design of a two-dimensional coded-interleaving system for fading channels."

A critical component is the ability to safely land in hazardous terrain as part of a mission, or triggered by an emergency situation. In this paper, we present an advanced navigation system for continuous on-board terrain reconstruction for the purpose of hazard-free landing site detection for the autonomous navigation of a Mars Science Helicopter - a JPL research concept that investigates the feasibility of flying a multi-kilogram science payload at various Mars science locations, with flight ranges of multiple kilometers per flight. Our approach builds on a visionbased perception system that incorporates an on-board visualinertial state estimator augmented by a laser altimeter (range- VIO), and a structure-from-motion 3D reconstruction approach that uses a single, downward-looking camera to provide dense depth measurements while the vehicle is in motion. Depth measurements are accumulated in a local, robot-centric, multiresolution elevation map that is analyzed by a landing site detector to extract safe landing areas below the rotorcraft, based on a heuristic that includes slope, roughness and the presence of landing hazards. Detected landing sites are prioritized by an on-board autonomy engine that either selects suitable landing sites for immediate landing maneuvers, or can explore a terrain location as part of a mission in order to find a best landing site in a pre-planned area. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach on simulated data and data acquired with a surrogate unmanned aerial system (UAS) executing flights over relevant terrain."

In this work, we review the methodology followed by the SMAP regularized dual-channel (DCA) retrieval algorithm. We show that the new implementation generated SM retrievals that not only satisfy the SMAP accuracy requirements but also show a performance comparable to the single-channel algorithm that uses the V polarized brightness temperature (SCA-V). Due to a lack of in situ measurements we cannot evaluate the accuracy of the VOD, but in this work, we will show analysis with the intention of providing an understanding of the VOD product."

First, we apply a standard planar Poincare ́ map in the spatial problem to identify a resonant landing orbit. Next we generate an ”invariant funnel” of trajectories that converge to the orbit, which acts as an attractor. The funnel has a wide mouth, thousands of kilometers wide, that shrinks to a small disc at a landing site only a few kilometers (or less) wide. These funnels are governed by ”resonant rings” of landing trajectories, and will make navigation more simple and robust."

As new missions are launched, the GDSA team redistributes analysts to these new missions, causing shortages in previous missions. The GDSA team can significantly benefit from the automation and optimization of the downlink process of telemetry data. In fact, there is a need for a better understanding of why the data is corrupted, so that the GDSA team can best determine the root cause of the issues in the GDS. This paper presents machine learning and deep learning based approaches to automate and optimize the detection of data loss. We first created a pipeline to automatically accumulate data from the telemetry databases (MAROS, Telemetry Data Storage, and GDS Elastic Search Database) in the downlink process. With our newly created datasets, we perform feature selection to supplement the GDSA understanding of the downlink process and provide supplemental analysis on the importance of different features. We implement various machine learning and deep learning based models, including support vector machines, ensemble methods, and deep neural networks and evaluate their accuracies in identifying whether a downlink process is complete or incomplete. We utilize fast hyperparameter optimization methods that allow our models to quickly be re-trained, allowing them to quickly be tuned and optimized on daily incoming data in real time. This hyperparameter optimization also allows our methods to be quickly integrated into other JPL missions. Our results show that our best-performing machine learning and deep learning based models outperform the existing GDSA detection software by 6 accuracy points and can aid analysts by providing insights into the data accountability problem. Since these various machine learning and deep learning approaches vary significantly in interpretability, we provide a discussion on the tradeoffs between their performance and trustworthiness in helping detect issues in data transmission."

PFS is an important step in the optical navigation pipeline for an autonomous small spacecraft to approach an unknown small body. The algo- rithm estimates the rotation pole and 3D shape (visual hull) of the small body using only the lit pixels within the silhouette of the small body, the body’s rotation rate, the spacecraft attitude, and the spacecraft-target relative distance, which is estimated from orbit determination. We present detailed numerical simulations and multiple sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PFS algorithm in different scenarios and target bodies."

Therefore, understanding the seasonal pattern of inundation can be a component for regional to global scale carbon models. Measurement of inundation extent also establishes a benchmark for the current status of wetland areas, useful in assessing the future impacts of climate change. The incorporation of frequent measurements of inundation extent into large-scale hydrological models would permit the evaluation of more detailed seasonal and longer-term floodplain dynamics and their associated management implications.The Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) constellation of satellites launched in 2016, and carries receivers capable of receiving data from L-band GNSS reflections. Delay Doppler maps (DDM) are generated on board and telemetered to the ground, along with a small number of raw data takes that can be used for special processing on the ground for evaluation purposes. It has been previously shown that these data can be sensitive to inundation.The NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar, currently planned for launch in January 2023, has both an L-band and S-band SAR for earth imaging. The L-band SAR, which will image the Earth's land mass twice every 12 days, has a requirement for measuring wetland inundation extent at the 1 ha scale. One of the sites that will be used to validate this requirement is Yucatan Lake, Louisiana. This oxbow lake and surrounding area located adjacent to the Mississippi river experiences periodic and extensive flooding in the surrounding forest areas.In 2019, NASA's UAVSAR fully polarimetric airborne L-band SAR conducted a flight campaign to image a dozen sites in the SE USA at approximately 12-day intervals and both in the morning and evening, to simulate the type of data NISAR will obtain. One site imaged during this campaign was the Yucatan Lake area, spanning water stages from low to high flood conditions.It has been demonstrated previously that GNSS reflectometry such as that measured by CYGNSS may be used to characterize surface inundation. It has also been known for decades that L-band SAR may be used to characterize not only the presence of open water, but also the presence of subcanopy inundation in forested areas. In this paper we will present results comparing data from these two types of instruments."

Recent field and laboratory measurements demonstrate that lightning generates extremely large amounts of oxidants, including hydrogen oxides (HOx) and O3. Here we implement these lightning-produced oxidants in a global chemical transport model to examine its global impact on tropospheric composition. We find that lightning-produced oxidants can increase global mass weighted OH by 0.3-10%, and affect CO, O3, and reactive nitrogen substantially, depending on the emission strength of oxidants from lightning. Our work highlights the importance and uncertainties of lightning-produced oxidants, as well as the need for rethinking the role of lightning in tropospheric oxidation chemistry."

Based on our sensemaking-model of monitoring, we identified key properties of monitoring flight path. We designed scenarios with associated behavioral markers that provide measures of monitoring performance and a short training module emphasizing our proactive, anticipatory view of monitoring.   Nineteen first officers from a major US airline participated in the training study. Each pilot flew in a simulator pretest, participated in a training session, and flew in a simulator posttest.  We found modest but significant improvements in monitoring. The study collected video, simulator, and eyetracking data and also manipulated whether the Flight Director was on or off.

This has given the operations team the opportunity to influence the design, with a goal of increasing overall system operability. This paper presents example operability challenges, opportunities, and solutions arising from the Critical Design Review (CDR) system design. The integrated wing assembly design directly couples a scientific instrument (the REASON sounding radar) to the spacecraft’s power source (solar array wing panels). Impacts to mission operations of this design include: increased slew durations; solar array pointing constraints during inner cruise, Europa flybys, and orbit trim maneuvers; and stray light intrusions into the stellar reference units’ keep out zones. The use of CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) Class-2 for reliable downlink of the large volume of Europa Clipper science data is described, along with nominal and off-nominal use cases. The effort to improve post-launch spacecraft visibility by adding a third low-gain antenna to the spacecraft is detailed. The design of the bulk data store has necessitated the implementation of accountable data products (ADPs), accountability identifiers (AIDs), and metadata packets to provide end-to-end science data accountability. To streamline and automate the flight rules generation and checking process, a first order and temporal logic-based solution of expressing flight rules without ambiguity, and whose programmatic implementation can be automated, is proposed. The focus on operability has had a positive influence on Europa Clipper design decisions, although cost, schedule, budget, heritage, and other technical concerns have many times outweighed operability concerns. However, experience to date demonstrates that this approach to operability results in more thorough, balanced consideration of the effect of early design trades and decisions on the operations phase of a mission than seen in many previous missions, and provides operations development insight into prioritizing work to go."

It is one of the major causes of firefighter fatalities. Research has been done using CMOS vision cameras combined with thermal sensors to perform remote detection and dynamic classification of fire and smoke patterns. Tests and experiments have been done to detect fire and smoke remotely. The inexpensive visible and infrared sensors used in the tests corroborate and closely follow the detailed trends recorded by the more expensive (and less mobile) radiometers and thermocouples. Deep neural networks (DNN) have been used to detect, classify and track fire and smoke areas. Real-time segmentation is utilized to measure the fire and smoke boundaries. The segmentations are used to dynamically monitor fluctuations in temperature, fire size and smoke progression in the monitored areas. A fire and smoke progression curve has been drawn to predict the flashover point. In the paper, data analysis and preliminary results will be shown.

The high operating temperature (HOT) BIRD focal plane arrays (FPAs) offer the same high performance, uniformity, operability, manufacturability, and affordability advantages as InSb. However, mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) HOT-BIRD FPAs can operate at significantly higher temperatures (>150K) than InSb FPAs (typically 80K). Moreover, while InSb has a fixed cutoff wavelength (~5.4 µm), the HOT-BIRD offers a continuous adjustable cutoff wavelength, ranging from ~4 µm to >15 µm, and is therefore also suitable for long wavelength infrared (LWIR) as well. The LWIR detectors based on the BIRD architecture has also demonstrated significant operating temperature advantages over those based on traditional p-n junction designs. Two 6U SmalSat missions CIRAS (Cubesat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder) and HyTI (Hyperspectral Thermal Imager) are based on JPL’s T2SL BIRD focal plane arrays (FPAs). Based on III-V compound semiconductors, the BIRD FPAs offer a breakthrough solution for the realization of low cost (high yield), high-performance FPAs with excellent uniformity and pixel-to-pixel operability. We have also exploring the possibilities of implementing either metasurface resonator cavity or metasurface based flatlens to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the detectors."

EMIT used automated scheduling technology to analyze aspects of the mission design. The automated scheduling technology was used to construct schedules which were then automatically analyzed with respect to science acquired. These analyses can be performed for a range of spacecraft hardware configurations, observation strategies, and science requirements. By studying the effects of changes on the above inputs, better hardware configurations, observation strategies, and science requirements can be formulated. The use of a pointing mirror on EMIT was under consideration, and this analysis aided in determining whether or not to keep it as part of the design of the instrument. Clouds will also have a large impact on the coverage of science targets achievable by the mission. Analysis was done on how clouds could impact the coverage achievable as well as the data volume. This analysis with clouds also aided in determining the coverage criteria for the mission. It was necessary to find a criteria that was achievable with some margin as well as satisfies the science goals of the mission."

Therefore, the necessity to manage and mitigate transient instabilities is essential for successfully deploying formation structures. This paper develops a novel control architecture that augments the baseline formation maintenance controller to mitigate transient instabilities. At its heart, the proposed architecture consists of a projection operator based estimator disguised as a reference model that generates collision-free trajectories for the agents to follow. This paper’s main theoretical result shows that the proposed control architecture can simultaneously mitigate transient instabilities and guarantee asymptotic convergence of the formation dynamics. Also, an illustrative example demonstrates the theoretical developments presented in this paper."

Thus, this region is important for understanding aerosol perturbations and their resulting impacts on atmospheric changes during COVID-19 lockdown period, a natural experimental condition created by the pandemic. By analyzing 5 years (2016–2020) data of aerosols and performing a radiative transfer calculation, we found that columnar and near-surface aerosol loadings decreased, leading to reductions in radiative cooling at the surface and top of the atmosphere and atmospheric warming during lockdown period. Further, satellite data analyses showed increases in cloud optical thickness and cloud-particle effective radius and decrease in lower tropospheric air temperature during lockdown period. These results indicate critical influences of COVID-19 lockdown on regional climate and water cycle over Indo-Gangetic Plain, emphasizing need for further studies from modeling perspectives."

Unlike traditional aerosol component retrieval, this approach allows the inference of some information about aerosol composition directly from measured radiance, rather than indirectly through the inversion of optical parameters, and has been integrated into the GRASP algorithm. The newly developed GRASP/Component approach was applied to 13 AERONET sites for different aerosol types under the assumption of aerosol internal mixing rules to analyze the characteristics of aerosol components and their distribution patterns. The results indicate that the retrievals can characterize well the spatial and temporal variability of the component concentration for different aerosol types. A reasonable agreement between GRASP BC retrievals and MERRA-2 BC products is found for all different aerosol types. In addition, the relationships between aerosol component content and aerosol optical parameters such as aerosol optical depth (AOD), fine-mode fraction (FMF), absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), scattering Ångström exponent (SAE), and single scattering albedo (SSA) are also analyzed for indirect verifying the reliability of the component retrieval. It was demonstrated the GRASP/Component optical retrievals are in good agreement with AERONET standard products [e.g., correlation coefficient (R) of 0.93–1.0 for AOD, fine-mode AOD (AODF), coarse-mode AOD (AODC) and Ångström exponent (AE); R = ~ 0.8 for absorption AOD (AAOD) and SSA; RMSE (root mean square error) < 0.03 for AOD, AODF, AODC, AAOD and SSA]. Thus, it is demonstrated the GRASP/Component approach can provide aerosol optical products with comparable accuracy as the AERONET standard products from the ground-based sun photometer measurements as well as some additional important inside on aerosol composition."

Very-high resolution (VHR, <2 m) stereo derived digital surface models are available to monitor these forests, but, a similar resolution digital terrain model (DTM) is required to extract information about tree height, which is often used to estimate carbon content. To our knowledge, no openly available VHR DTM currently exists. To address this need, we developed approaches to extract DTMs by filtering VHR stereo point clouds (PCs) in sparse canopies of Alaska. Our evaluation consisted of two stereo processing methods with three PC search radii, at six different tree canopy cover (TCC) intervals. We found VHR DTMs were robust for estimating bare ground at TCC intervals less than 40% with vertical errors <1.6 m using airborne small footprint light detection and ranging (LiDAR) as reference."

Despite  their  advantages,  thetheoretical  maximum  contraction  ratio  of  McKibben  muscles  isonly  36.3%,  which  restricts  the  range  of  motion  of  the  systemsthey actuate. This work introduces a novel ‘chain-link actuator’that   exploits   the   bending   stiffness   of   McKibben   muscles   toachieve  contraction  ratios  of  more  than  50%.  A  static  modelthat  captures  the  relationship  between  pressure,  displacement,and  force  is  presented  and  validated  on  several  real  chain-linkactuator  systems."

MISE is a high-optical through-put pushbroom infrared imaging spectrometer that can collect measurements within Europa’s challenging radiation environment. It is externally mounted to the spacecraft and as a result is exposed to high radiation levels and cold temperatures. The instrument consists of a scan mirror assembly, an optical bench including a Dyson spectrometer and a telescope, and a structure that supports a cryocooler and a radiator. The cryocooler is used to actively cool the focal plane array and the spectrometer. The heat from the cryocooler is rejected through pyrolytic graphite sheet thermal straps to a honeycomb radiator. MISE will implement thermal hardware that will either not be used on other parts of the spacecraft or have a more extreme environment than the spacecraft. As a result, the MISE instrument performed numerous environmental tests on its thermal hardware. This paper discusses the results of the thermal cycling and radiation tests performed on the MISE thermal hardware including a Lockheed Martin Micro1-2 cryocooler, Pyrolytic graphite sheet thermal straps, Annealed pyrolytic graphite K-Core, Rosemount Platinum Resistance Thermometers, Tayco Kapton Thermofoil heaters, Dale Ohm resistors, and aluminum honeycomb and facesheets."

The redox sensitivity of cerium relative to other rare earth elements and its uptake in carbonate minerals make the Ce anomaly (Ce/Ce*) a particularly useful proxy for capturing redox conditions in the local marine environment. Here, we report Ce/Ce* data in marine carbonate rocks through 3.5 billion years of Earth’s history, focusing in particular on the mid-Proterozoic Eon (i.e., 1.8 – 0.8 Ga). To better understand the role of atmospheric oxygenation, we use Ce/ Ce* data to estimate the partial pressure of atmospheric oxygen (pO2) through this time. Our thermodynamics-based modeling supports a major rise in atmospheric oxygen level in the aftermath of the Great Oxidation Event (~ 2.4 Ga), followed by invariant pO2 of about 1% of present atmospheric level through most of the Proterozoic Eon (2.4 to 0.65 Ga)."

They have assimilated previously independent modeling efforts in ocean circulation, atmospheric composition, the stratosphere, land surface, and the cryosphere, and are today demonstrably more skillful than earlier efforts. Yet the structural uncertainty in the latest model projections is actually increasing. Meanwhile, impacts of climate change on, for instance, wildfires, tropical cyclones and sea level, appear to be increasing faster than we have been able to predict. I will address some of the current issues at the bleeding edges of model development and the continuing importance of model evaluation."

The hypotheses concern an inequality constraint on the norm of some elements of the system state.  Each of two filters minimizes the summed-squares of its estimation errors subject to one or the other direction of the inequality constraint.  This solution is motivated by the problem of satellite conjunction assessment, wherein the constraint concerns the close approach distance between two space objects.  The outcome of the test can inform decisions concerning risk mitigation maneuvers."

Eighteen pilots performed the experiment in the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA Ames Research Center and twenty pilots in the SIMONA Research Simulator at Delft University of Technology. The experiment used a full-factorial design with three motion filter orders (first-, second-, and third-order) and two filter break frequencies (0.5 and 2.0 rad/s), in addition to reference no-motion and full-motion conditions. Key task variables, such as the quality of the motion and visual cues and the characteristics of the sidestick, were matched across both simulators. Overall, the expected effects of filter order and break frequency variations were found, with both increasing order and increasing break frequency causing pilots to use less motion feedback in their control strategy, resulting in lower tracking performance. Furthermore, across the wide range of filter orders tested in the experiment, the existing Sinacori-Schroeder motion fidelity criterion was found to be a good predictor of the interaction effects of both filter settings on pilot control behavior. For the same motion condition, there was a consistent offset in the results between simulators, due to the more high-gain control strategy adopted by a number of the VMS pilots. Still, the observed relative trends in pilot control behavior and performance between motion conditions were equivalent in both simulators and thus accurately replicated."

SHIIVER was designed to be a test bed for the scaling of cryogenic fluid management technologies as applied to large upper stages and long duration in-space stages.  The hardware consists of a 4 meter diameter stainless steel tank, structural skirts supporting the tank in the aft direction, and an aluminum forward skirt with vapor cooling channels bolted to it.  The initial testing of the SHIIVER hardware was with liquid hydrogen and liquid nitrogen (as a substitute fluid for liquid oxygen and liquid methane) and sought to demonstrate the use of boil-off vapor to intercept heat on a structural skirt, multilayer insulation (MLI) on the tank domes, and the radio frequency mass gauge (RFMG).  Testing was completed in four stages: a baseline thermal vacuum test prior to installation of the MLI, a thermal vacuum test after the MLI installation, a reverberant acoustic test, and a subsequent thermal vacuum test to verify that no damage occurred during the reverberant acoustic testing.  Each thermal vacuum test with chamber wall at ambient temperature and vacuum level in the 10-6 torr range was conducted continuously between approximately 90% full and 25% full.  Test results showed that the vapor cooling reduced the heat load to the tank by approximately 10%, but the boil-off by less than 3% at 50% full with no MLI on the domes. It reduced the heat load to the tank by approximately 10%, but the boil-off was essentially unchanged at 50% full whether or not vapor cooling was operational with MLI on the domes. The MLI reduced the heat load to the tank by approximately 40% at all fill levels, but the boil-off by approximately 25% at 90% full and 45% below 65% full.  The RFMG performed well over all fill ranges, and several RF tank modes were used to gauge the mass of fluid in the tank. SHIIVER was then exposed to an acoustic environment of 147 dB OASPL (overall sound pressure level) in a reverberant chamber. The acoustic environment and profile envelopes the upper stage internal acoustic level of several different modern launch vehicles. No structural or thermal performance changes were observed as a result of acoustic testing. Final thermal vacuum testing after the acoustic testing showed no degradation to the MLI due to the acoustic environment as measured via system heat loads."

In this work, different types of polymer and MnO2 cathode capacitors have been tested for scintillation breakdown using a constant current stress (CCS) technique modified to allow detection of amplitudes and duration of current spikes.  Monitoring of leakage currents with time under bias is used to assess the effect of scintillations.  The appearance and composition of damaged sites have been examined after deprocessing and cross-sectioning.  Thermal processes during scintillations have been analyzed, a mechanism of breakdown based on growth of conductive filaments in the dielectric suggested, and self-healing processes in polymer and MnO2 cathode capacitors discussed."

Since the early 1990’s,   the   Massachusetts   Institute   of   Technology (MIT)   Lincoln   Laboratory   (LL)   has   been   collecting radar   measurements   for   the   NASA   ODPO   under agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense. The Haystack   Ultrawideband   Satellite   Imaging   Radar (HUSIR)   is   the   primary   ground-based   radar   sensor used by the ODPO and provides data on orbital debris down   to   an   approximate   size   of   5.5   mm   below   1000km   altitude using   the   NASA   size   estimation   model (SEM). Since orbital debris of this size are a significant risk to both human and robotic  missions in LEO,  the sensitivity of this radar makes it a high-value sensor. The NASA ODPO radar measurements are conducted on   a   continual   basis   for   monitoring   and   enabling modeling of the orbital debris environment over time. HUSIR   observations   from   2019   are   the   most   recent snapshot   of   the   environment   that   has   been   measured and   analyzed   to   date.   In   recent   years,   HUSIR measurements   indicated   relatively   stable   populations for the orbital debris objects that it is able to detect. In 2019,   several   interesting   events   happened   on-orbit, including   the   start   of   large   constellation   deployments into LEO, as well as the Indian anti-satellite test with Microsat-R (International Designator 2019-006A, U.S. Strategic   Command   Space   Surveillance   Network catalog  number  43947).  Due  to these  events,  coupled with a general increase in the number of missions and participants   launching   missions   in   recent   years, continual   monitoring   is   necessary   to   determine   the effects   of   this   increased   activity   on   the   orbital   debris environment. This paper will explore the results of the 2019   HUSIR   radar   measurements,   including   above-average flux measurements at lower LEO altitudes and the   evolution   of   the   flux   during   the   time   of observations."

The current status of the cloud uniformity, liquid water content, and drop-size calibration results will be discussed.  The goals achieved in this calibration were to establish a uniform cloud and to generate transfer functions from the inputs of airspeed, spray bar atomizing air pressure, and spray bar water pressure to the outputs of median volumetric diameter (drop size distributions) and liquid water content.  This was completed for both 14 CFR Parts 25 and 29, Appendix C (“typical” icing) and Appendix O (supercooled large drop) conditions.  The cloud uniformity from the Standard nozzles has remained the same as what was reported for the 2014 full calibration.  Changes were made to the Mod1 nozzle cloud, resulting in higher liquid water content values associated with the Mod1 cloud."

Adequate process modeling of 3D woven Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs) is necessary to predict and estimate the effects of the manufacturing process on these defects. A preliminary step towards this is achieved with the commercial Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tool Abaqus complemented with written user subroutines to account for the effect of shrinkage and thermoelastic properties evolution as a function of the degree of cure of the bulk matrix phase in a 3D woven composite repeating unit cell (RUC). As a pathfinder, the process modeling framework is demonstrated on a simplified 3D woven RUC of an AS4/RIMR 135 system. Curing simulations are performed on the 3D woven RUC to observe the processing induced residual stresses. The results of the analysis show that high stress concentrations, present within the 3D intertow matrix bordering the binder tow, coincide with X-Ray computed tomography (X-Ray-CT) scan data depicting cracking in the same location"

We analyze a NuSTAR observation of the XRP XTE J1858+034 during its outburst in 2019.  The spectrum is fit with a phenomenological, a semi-empirical and a physical spectral model.  A candidate cyclotron line is found at 48 keV, implying a magnetic field of 5.4×1012G at the site of emission.  This is also supported by the physical best-fit model.   A  nominal Gaia distance  of  1.55 kpc  is  available  for  a  star  that  is  close  to  –  although  not coincident with – the previously proposed optical counterpart but, based on Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data, the standard disk accretion-torque theory allowed us to infer a distance of 10.9±1.0 kpc. Pulse profiles are single-peaked and show a pulsed fraction that is strongly energy-dependent at least up to 40keV."

The trash components used in the trash models not only impacts the final solid trash disk quality, but also the water and gas effluent compositions. In order to better design an auxiliary system to treat the effluent streams, both the input trash components and the effluent must be characterized. Evolved gas analysis (EGA) methods are used to characterize the input trash components. The EGA results will be used to determine various HMC operational parameters, as well as to determine the optimal operation for the TCPS system."

We use ERA-Interim (ERA-I) and TRMM 3B42 data to investigate day-to-day convective variability and distinguish the roles of horizontal MSE (or moisture) advection versus vertical advection, sources, and sinks. Over tropical convergence zones, results suggest that horizontal moisture advection is a primary driver of day-to-day precipitation fluctuations; when drying via horizontal moisture advection is smaller (greater) than Chikira’s “column process,” precipitation tends to amplify (decay). In the absence of horizontal moisture advection, precipitation tends to increase spontaneously almost universally through a positive column process feedback. This bulk positive feedback is characterized by negative effective gross moist stability (GMS), which is maintained throughout the tropical convergence zones. How this positive feedback is achieved varies geographically, depending on the shape of vertical velocity (omega) profiles. In regions where omega profiles are top-heavy, the effective GMS is negative primarily owing to strong feedbacks between convection and diabatic MSE sources (radiative and surface fluxes). In these regions, vertical MSE advection stabilizes the atmosphere (positive vertical GMS). Where omega profiles are bottom-heavy, by contrast, a positive feedback is primarily driven by import of MSE through a shallow circulation (negative vertical GMS). The diabatic feedback and vertical GMS are in a seesaw balance, offsetting one another. Our results suggest that ubiquitous convective variability is amplified by the same mechanism as moisture-mode instability."

The primary element shape was a pair of elliptical planform ramps that were inclined at equal and opposite angles with respect to the local streamwise direction. The element shapes were designed to induce transient growth disturbances that would lead to sustained azimuthal modulation of the boundary layer flow while limiting the nearfield disturbances to avoid an immediate, i.e., effective tripping of the boundary layer. The bulk of the run matrix consisted of testing different element height sat free stream unit Reynolds numbers ranging from 9.8 to 13.1 million per meter. Other element shapes previously designed for tripping hypersonic boundary layers were also implemented. The model was instrumented with surface mounted Kulite<sup>®</sup> and PCB<sup>®</sup> pressure transducers and thermocouples. Spectra from the PCBs<sup>®</sup> indicated clear suppression of the second-mode instability; however, neither the PCB<sup>®</sup> spectra nor the heat transfer data presented strong evidence for delayed turbulent flow. Complementary stability computations likewise demonstrated second-mode reduction, particularly just downstream of the roughness, but also revealed a rise in first mode (streak-instability) amplitudes from the baseline that was likely responsible for the earlier transition observed for taller roughness cases."

However, the influence of land–atmosphere feedbacks on future P–E changes and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that soil moisture (SM) strongly impacts future P–E changes, especially in drylands, by regulating evapotranspiration and atmospheric moisture inflow. Using modelling and empirical approaches, we find a consistent negative SM feedback on P–E, which may offset ~60% of the decline in dryland P–E otherwise expected in the absence of SM feedbacks. The negative feedback is not caused by atmospheric thermodynamic responses to declining SM; rather, reduced SM, in addition to limiting evapotranspiration, regulates atmospheric circulation and vertical ascent to enhance moisture transport into drylands. This SM effect is a large source of uncertainty in projected dryland P–E changes, underscoring the need to better constrain future SM changes and improve the representation of SM–atmosphere processes in models."

Here, we explore differences in the performance of the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), Noah land surface model with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP), the Catchment model, and the third-generation Simplified Simple Biosphere model (SiB3) in their ability to reproduce observed snow water equivalent (SWE) during the ablation season at 10 Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations over 1992–2012. During the ablation period, net radiation generally has stronger correlations with observed melt rates than does air temperature. Average ablation rates tend to be higher (in both model predictions and observations) at stations with a large accumulation of SWE. The differences in the dates of last snow between models and observations range from several days to approximately a month (on average 5.1 days earlier than in observations). If the surface cover in the models is changed from observed vegetation to bare soil in all of the models, only the melt rate of the VIC model increases. The differences in responses of models to canopy removal are directly related to snowpack energy inputs, which are further affected by different algorithms for surface albedo and energy allocation across the models. We also find that the melt rates become higher in VIC and lower in Noah-MP if the shrub/grass present at the observation sites is switched to trees."

A benchmark set of flow field property data were obtained to assess current CFD capabilities and develop better modeling approaches for these turbulent flow fields where accurate calculation of turbulent heat flux is important.  Three different convergent-divergent nozzles were investigated with exit Mach numbers of: 1.36, 1.63 and 2.0 at their perfectly expanded conditions.  The conditions of the jet were set to obtain a temperature difference of zero between the jet core and the ambient air, and then the temperature difference was progressively increased, at the same jet Mach number.  Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), spontaneous rotational Raman scattering spectroscopy (SRS), Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) and probe-based measurements were used to acquire high quality, spatially-resolved measurements of the mean and root mean square (rms) velocities as well as the mean and rms gas temperatures and densities in both hot and cold supersonic jet flows.   The non-intrusive flow measurements are compared both against probe measurements and against standard Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) predictions of the supersonic jet flow properties."

These liner samples have been integrated and acoustically characterized in the liner flow test facility DUCT-R at DLR Berlin as well as in the liner flow test facility GFIT at NASA Langley. Besides the dissipation coefficients and the axial pressure profiles, the liner wall impedance was educed by first determining the axial wave numbers and then applying a straightforward method based on the one-dimensional Convected Helmholtz Equation. Finally, the comparison of the liner impedance values to the NASA results show a fairly good agreement."

We focus on three local convective regimes and diagnose model behaviors using the  Local  Coupling  metrics  (Santanello  et  al.  2018). NARR agrees  well  with observations except a  slightly warmer  and  drier surface with higher  downwelling  shortwave radiation  and  lower  evaporative  fraction. On  clear-sky  days, it  shows  warmer  and  drier early-morning  conditions  in  both  models with significant  underestimates in surface  evaporation by EAMv1-RRM. On the majority of the ARM-observed shallow cumulus days, there is no or little low-level clouds in either model. When captured in models, the simulated shallow cumulus shows much  less cloud  fraction  and lower cloud  bases  than observed. On  the  days  with  late-afternoon deep convection, models tend to present a stable early-morning lower atmosphere more frequently than the  observations, suggesting that the deep  convection is triggered  more  often  by  elevated instabilities. Generally, CAM5-CAPT  can  reproduce the local L-A  coupling  processes  to  some extent due  to  the constrained  early-morning  conditions  and  large-scale  winds. EAMv1-RRM exhibits large precipitation deficits and warm and dry biases towards mid-to-late summers, which may be an amplification through a positive L-A feedback among initial atmosphere and land states, convection triggering and large-scale circulations."

Available data from a recent experiment on the Common Research Model with Natural Laminar Flow (CRM-NLF) in the National Transonic Facility at the NASA Langley Research Center are used to assess the current transition modeling capability in NASA's OVERFLOW 2.3b solver for a swept wing configuration with nonzero taper and transonic cruise conditions. Specifically, the OVERFLOW solutions are used to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the transport-equation-based transition models. Results highlight that the Spalart-Allmaras-based amplification factor transport (AFT-2017b) equation model and Menter’s shear-stress transport equation (SST2003)-based Langtry-Menter transition models (either with or without the modeling of crossflow transition) significantly underpredict the reported extent of laminar flow region over the entire span of the wing, irrespective of which instability mechanism(s) is expected to dominate the onset of the transition process. We show that the transition correlations underlying these models fail to account for the stabilizing effect of compressibility on the Tollmien-Schlichting transition, which is likely to be a major contributor to the underprediction of the laminar flow region on the CRM-NLF. The SST-2003-based Langtry-Menter model also appears to inaccurately predict the chordwise pressure variation along the majority of the wing span at all the flow conditions studied herein, due to how the turbulence intensity levels were enforced in the computations and how that was interfering with the functioning of the underlying turbulence model within the boundary layer. The AFT and Langtry-Menter models appear to be sensitive to the level of the freestream turbulence intensity, but the degree of sensitivity varies across the models."

Diffuse recharge is also the process through which climate and climate change directly affect groundwater. In this study, we evaluated diffuse recharge over the conterminous U.S. simulated by a suite of land surface models (LSMs) that were forced using a common set of meteorological input data. Simulated annual recharge exhibited spatial patterns that were similar among the LSMs, with the highest values in the eastern U.S. and Pacific Northwest. However, the magnitudes of annual recharge varied significantly among the models and were associated with differences in simulated ET, runoff and snow. Evaluation against two independent datasets did not answer the question of whether the ensemble mean performs the best, due to inconsistency between those datasets. The amplitude and timing of seasonal maximum recharge differed among the models, influenced strongly by model physics governing deep soil moisture drainage rates and, in cold regions, snowmelt. Evaluation using in situ soil moisture observations suggested that true recharge peaks 1-3 months later than simulated recharge, indicating systematic biases in simulating deep soil moisture. However, recharge from lateral flows and through preferential flows cannot be inferred from soil moisture data, and the seasonal cycle of simulated groundwater storage actually compared well with in situ groundwater observations. Long-term trends in recharge were not consistently correlated with either precipitation trends or temperature trends. This study highlights the need to employ dynamic flow models in LSMs, among other improvements, to enable more accurate simulation of recharge."

Since many applicable lander and upper stage vehicles utilize cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen propellants, it is appealing to incorporate fuel cells into potential mission concepts. A fuel cell could generate electricity, heat, and water from the residual hydrogen and oxygen propellants. Such a concept depends on the capability of the fuel cell to utilize dry, propellant-grade reactants at reduced pressures compared to typical fuel cell operating conditions. This report describes a NASA evaluation of two passive water removal, non-flow-through proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells: a twelve-cell 50 sq. cm active area stack and a seven-cell 150 sq. cm active area stack. Both stacks operated on research grade hydrogen and oxygen reactants supplied at pressures ranging from 20 psia up to the 45-48 psia design operating point, reliably supporting current densities of at least 450 mA/sq. cm at reduced pressures. Polarization curves, fitted with a semi-empirical equation for overpotential, show an increase in effective ohmic resistance and decrease in reversible cell potential, hydrogen crossover current, and Tafel slope when operating at lower pressures, resulting in a reduction in cell voltage at all current densities. Fitted parameters are compared to published values and rationalized with first principles explanations."

After  comprehensive  analysis  of  ATMS  stare  data  and  the  corresponding  VIIRS  data,  the ATMS pitch, roll and yaw pointing angle errors are found from the  nadir  perpendicular,  the  nadir  oblique  shallow  angle,  and  the  off-nadir  perpendicular  coastline  crossing  data,  respectively.  In  this  study,  we  first  determine  the  ATMS  radiometric  coastline  crossing  time  by  using  the  ATMS  radiometric  count  data.  Since  the  coastline  can  be  located anywhere within one ATMS FOV from the passive (regular scanning) geolocation data, depending on the scan starting time, it is not a valid assumption for the inflection point    being    the    same    as    the    coastline    location.    Consequently, using the passive geolocation data to validate the sensor’s on-orbit pointing angle performance is limited. After finding the ATMS radiometric coastline crossing time from  the  ATMS  data,  we  compare  it  with  the  VIIRS  effective time stamp (see main text). Specifically the VIIRS M3, M4 & M5 (true color) & M15 and M16 bands (thermal) data   have   a   much   smaller   footprint   size.   Using   the   differences  of  the  ATMS  and  VIIRS  (effective) coastlines crossing times, the N20 ATMS pitch, roll and yaw pointing angle  errors  are  found  to  be  -0.09o,  -0.24o  and  0.28o, respectively.  To  determine  ATMS  geolocation  properly,  these on-orbit pointing errors need to be corrected, adding to the ATMS SDR Processing Coefficient Table, and passed on to the operational geolocation processing code."

For each EAP concept, a conventional TMS is designed for two electric component technology levels: state of the art and advanced. The goals for the paper are to compare the TMS designs for the above EAP concepts, to study how changes in requirements affect the TMS subcomponents, and to develop generalized TMS sizing relations. Each conventional TMS concept utilizes a liquid-based cooling methodology and is designed to cool the EAP electrical components only. The design parameters considered in this study include TMS architecture variation due to differing vehicle cooling requirements, electrical component efficiencies, vehicle total fuel burn or energy consumption, and electrical component operating temperatures. Results show that cooling components with low temperature limits increases TMS weight and demonstrate that efficiency gains of the specific technologies can net a lower weight TMS system despite more stringent temperature limits."

The successful mission launched September 7, 2013 and was de-orbited and impacted the moon's surface on April 17, 2014. The ground-side and onboard flight software for the mission was developed using a “Model-Based Software Engineering” (MBSE) methodology combined with strong reuse of Government and Commercial Off-The Shelf (G/COTS) components. Models of the spacecraft and flight software were developed in a graphical dynamics modeling package. Flight Software requirements were prototyped and refined using the simulated models. After the model was shown to work as desired in the simulation framework, C-code software was automatically generated from the models. The auto-generated software was then tested in real-time Processor-in-the-Loop and Hardware-in-the-Loop test beds. “Traveling Road Show” test beds were used for early integration tests with payloads and other subsystems. Traditional techniques for verifying computational sciences models were used to characterize the spacecraft simulation. A lightweight set of formal methods analysis, static analysis, formal inspection, and code coverage analyses were utilized to further reduce defects in the onboard flight software artifacts. These techniques were applied early and often in the development process, iteratively increasing the capabilities of software and fidelity of vehicle models and test beds."

ADMs are, thus, critical when converting satellite-borne broadband radiometry into estimated radiative fluxes. This paper applies a set of newly developed ADMs with a more refined scene definition and demonstrates tenable changes in estimated fluxes compared to currently operational ADMs. Newly developed ADMs use a semiphysical framework to consider cloud-top effective radius (¯¯R_e) and above-cloud water vapor (ACWV), in addition to accounting for surface wind speed and clouds’ phase, fraction, and optical depth. In effect, instantaneous TOA SW fluxes for marine liquid-phase clouds had the largest flux differences (of up to 25 W m−2) for lower solar zenith angles and cloud optical depth greater than 10 due to extremes in ¯¯R_e or ACWV. In regions where clouds had persistently extreme levels of ¯¯R_e (here mostly for ¯¯R_e < 7μm and ¯¯R_e > 15μm) or ACWV, instantaneous fluxes estimated from Aqua, Terra, Meteosat-8, and Meteosat-9 satellites using the two ADMs differed systematically, resulting in significant deviations in daily mean fluxes (up to ±10 W m^(−2)) and monthly mean fluxes (up to ±5 W m^(−2)). Flux estimates using newly developed, semiphysical ADMs may contribute to a better understanding of solar fluxes over low-level clouds. It remains to be seen whether aerosol indirect effects are impacted by these updates."

(SAGE) III has been operating on the International Space
Station (ISS) since mid-2017. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) number
density profiles are routinely retrieved from SAGE
III/ISS solar occultation measurements in the middle atmosphere.
Although NO2 density varies throughout the day due
to photochemistry, the standard SAGE NO2 retrieval algorithm
neglects these variations along the instrument’s line of
sight by assuming that the number density has a constant gradient
within a given vertical layer of the atmosphere. This assumption
will result in a retrieval bias for a species like NO2
that changes rapidly across the terminator. In this work we
account for diurnal variations in retrievals of NO2 from the
SAGE III/ISS measurements, and we determine the impact
of this algorithm improvement on the resulting NO2 number
densities. The first step in applying the diurnal correction is
to use publicly available SAGE III/ISS products to convert
the retrieved number density profiles to optical depth profiles.
The retrieval is then re-performed with a new matrix
that applies photochemical scale factors for each point along
the line of sight according to the changing solar zenith angle.
In general NO2 that is retrieved by accounting for these
diurnal variations is more than 10% lower than the standard
algorithm below 30 km. This effect is greatest in winter at
high latitudes and generally greater for sunrise occultations
than sunset. Comparisons with coincident profiles from the
Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS)
show that NO2 from SAGE III/ISS is generally biased high;
however the agreement improves by up to 20% in the mid-stratosphere
when diurnal variations are accounted for in
the retrieval. We conclude that diurnal variations along the
SAGE III/ISS line of sight are an important term to consider
for NO2 analyses at altitudes below 30 km."

Agro-pastoral droughts are endemic to the region and are considered the main natural hazard that contributes to food insecurity. Drought begins with rainfall deficit, gradually leading to soil moisture deficit, higher land surface temperature, and finally impacts to vegetation growth. Therefore, monitoring vegetation conditions is essential in understanding the progression of drought, potential effects on food security, and providing early warning information needed for drought mitigation decisions. Because vegetation processes couple the land and atmosphere, monitoring of vegetation conditions requires consideration of both water provision and demand. While there is consensus in using either the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or evapotranspiration(ET) for vegetation monitoring, a comprehensive assessment optimizing the use of both has not yet been done. Moreover, the evaluation methods for understanding the relationships between NDVI and ET for vegetation monitoring are also limited. Taking these gaps into account we have developed a framework to optimize vegetation monitoring using both NDVI and ET by identifying where they perform the best by using triple collocation and cross-correlation methods. We estimated the random error structure in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI; ET from the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model; and ET from land surface models (LSMs). LSM ET and SSEBop ET have been found to be better indicators for vegetation monitoring during extreme drought events, while NDVI could provide better information on vegetation condition during wetter than normal conditions. The random error structures of these variables suggest that LSM ET is most likely to provide important information for vegetation monitoring over low and high ends of the vegetation fraction areas. Over moderate vegetative areas, any of these variables could provide important vegetation information for drought characterization and food security assessments. While this study provides a framework for optimizing vegetation monitoring for drought and food security assessments over East Africa, the framework can be adopted to optimize vegetation monitoring over any other drought and food insecure region of the world."

Drought events pose a significant threat to economic livelihoods of dependent individuals, industries, and ecosystems (e.g., farmers, local tribes, hydroelectric power, wildlife). In 2017 alone, the Missouri River Basin experienced a severe drought that resulted in a $2.6 billion loss to the U.S. Northern Plains. In response to such events, organizations throughout the basin, such as the Montana Climate Office, have dedicated efforts for drought monitoring and communicating relevant information to local stakeholders. In an effort to aid regional decision-making capabilities, the project team partnered with the Montana Climate Office, NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Missouri Basin River Forecast Center, and NOAA Regional Climate Services, Central Region to create a monthly Composite Moisture Index (CMI) that relies on NASA Earth observations from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. From these satellites, as well as the NOAA NWS National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS), our team aggregated climate datasets including soil moisture, snow cover, snow depth, and snow water equivalent to compute a CMI that indicates regional moisture conditions during the winter months. The March CMI values produced over the Missouri River headwater subbasin strongly correlate (r = 0.75) with spring and early summer stream discharge, demonstrating the use of this metric to indicate moisture conditions for the snowmelt and growing seasons."

Simulations of scattered convective clouds near Houston, Texas are conducted, after being initialized with both relatively low and high CCN concentrations. Deep convective updrafts are identified, and trends in the updraft intensity and frequency are assessed. The factors contributing to the vertical velocity tendencies are examined to identify the physical processes associated with the CCN-induced, updraft changes. The models show several consistent trends. In general, the changes between the High- CCN and Low-CCN simulations in updraft magnitudes throughout the depth of the troposphere are within 15% for all of the models. All models produce stronger (~+5-15%) mean updrafts from ~4–7 km above ground level (AGL) in the High-CCN simulations, followed by a waning response up to ~8 km AGL in most of the models. Thermal buoyancy was more sensitive than condensate loading to varying CCN concentrations in most of the models and more impactful in the mean updraft responses. However, there are also differences between the models. The change in the amount of deep convective updrafts varies significantly. Furthermore, approximately half the models demonstrate neutral-to-weaker (~-5-0%) updrafts above ~8 km AGL, while the other models show stronger (~+10%) updrafts in the High-CCN simulations. The combination of the CCN-induced impacts on the buoyancy and vertical perturbation pressure gradient terms better explains these middle- and upper-tropospheric updraft trends than the buoyancy terms alone."

Examples are provided of stacks designed for 80 kWe and 500 kWe net electrical power. Examples are provided of eVTOL designed for 250 and 400 lb payload. The trade-offs included stack characteristics, hydrogen storage characteristics, and aircraft payload and range. The objectives were to identify the key technology drivers of a hydrogen rotorcraft, establish technology targets for a viable aircraft, and recommend research to address the fundamental pre-competitive barriers. The current U.S. infrastructure on hydrogen informed the targets and recommendations. The key conclusion is that the advances made in cell electrochemical power density over the last decade might allow a PEMFC system to meet, or even beat, piston engine powered light-utility rotorcraft. The development must focus on the key drivers of a hydrogen eVTOL. The drivers are ultra-light stack cooling and short-term hydrogen storage. A stack system of net electrical power 100−150 kWe with specific power 1.1 kWe/kg including air, cooling, and electrical subsystems, and a tank storage of 15% weight fraction hydrogen are the minimum targets to meet the performance of a modern piston-engine rotorcraft, with a range of 180 nautical miles, payload of 400 lb, and gross weight of about 1400 lb. This is defined as the objective aircraft. If only one target is met, an aircraft of half the range could be produced, with a 30% greater gross take-off weight. This is defined as an intermediate aircraft. Because definitive conclusions are premature without weights and loads data on a flight-worthy stack system, it is recommended that a fuel cell powered hydrogen eVTOL demonstrator be built and flown. The existing hydrogen infrastructure for cars provide ample opportunity to create a pilot program. About 12 metric tons of retail hydrogen are available for cars every day in California, which is less than 0.05% of the yearly hydrogen production in the U.S..

Here, we examine observations of cloud and drizzle properties retrieved using colocated airborne measurements from the Research Scanning Polarimeter and the Third Generation Airborne Precipitation Radar. We observe a bimodal DSD as the aircraft transects drizzling open-cells whereby the larger mode reaches a maximum size near cloud center and the smaller mode remains relatively constant in size. We review similarities between our observations with droplet growth processes and their connections with precipitation onset. We estimate droplet sedimentation using the cloud top DSD and find a correlation with rain water path of 0.82. We also examine how changes in liquid water paths and droplet concentrations may act to enhance or suppress precipitation."

In the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2),microwave sounder radiances from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A)are assimilated beginning with NOAA-15and continuing through the current period.  The time series of observation minus background statistics forAMSU-A channels sensitive to upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere show variabilities due to changes in AMSU-A constellation in the early AMSU-A period.Noted discrepancies are seen at the onset and exit of AMSU-A observations on the NOAA-15, NOAA-16, NOAA-17, and NASA EOS Aqua satellites.This effort characterizesthesensitivity, both in terms of the observations and the MERRA-2 analysis.  Furthermore, it exploresthe use of reprocessed and inter-calibrated datasets to evaluatewhether these homogenized observations can reduce the disparity due to change in instrumental biases against the model background.  The results indicate that the AMSU-A radiances used in MERRA-2 are the fundamental cause of this inter-platform sensitivitywhich can be mitigated by using reprocessed data.The results explore the importance of the reprocessing of the AMSU-A radiances as well as their inter-calibration."

A new TR-PIV system has been developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center which is capable of acquiring planar PIV image frame pairs at up to 25 kHz. The data reported here were collected at Mach numbers of 0.5 and 0.9 and at temperature ratios of 0.89 and 1.76. The field of view of the TR-PIV system covered six nozzle diameters along the lip line of the 50.8 mm diameter jet. The cold flow data at Mach 0.5 were compared with hotwire anemometry measurements in order to validate the new TR-PIV technique. The axial turbulence profiles measured across the shear layer using TR-PIV were thinner than those measured using hotwire anemometry and remained centred along the nozzle lip line. The collected TR-PIV data illustrate the differences in the single point statistical flow properties of cold and hot jet flows. The planar, time-resolved velocity records were then used to compute two-point space–time correlations of the flow at the Mach 0.9 flow condition. The TR-PIV results show that there are differences in the convective velocity and growth rate of the turbulent structures between cold and hot flows at the same Mach number."

This study shows that the assimilation of AIRS CCRs over the Arctic Ocean, providing more information than clear-sky radiances from areas affected by broken low-level stratus clouds, produces slightly cooler low-level temperatures and lower mid-tropospheric height through hydrostatic adjustment. In areas that are data void, as observed by clear-sky radiances, and dynamically active, the assimilation of CCRs provides valuable information that can improve the representation of individual baroclinic waves and their subsequent forecasts. The modifications induced by the assimilation of AIRS CCRs over the Arctic Ocean slightly modifies the geopotential height gradients between the Arctic and the mid-latitudes, leading to potential improvements in the forecast of individual baroclinic waves as is shown through a case study. The observing system experiment (OSE) is performed with the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) data assimilation and forecast system during boreal autumn 2014. AIRS CCRs are thinned to approximately one quarter the density of operationally assimilated AIRS radiances, consistent with their higher information content. Global, 6-hourly analyses are produced from 1 September to 10 November 2014 and 7-day forecasts are initialized at 0000 UTC daily. Since the CCR methodology is widely applicable, these findings are also relevant to other infrared sensors."

In this paper we study the implications of interchange reconnection for the structure of the plasma and field in the heliosphere. We use the Adaptively Refined Magnetohydrodynamic Solver (ARMS) to simulate the coronal magnetic evolution in a coronal topology containing both a pseudostreamer and helmet streamer. We
begin with a geometry containing a low-latitude coronal hole that is separated from the main polar coronal hole by a pseudostreamer. We drive the system by imposing rotating flows at the Solar surface within and around the low-latitude coronal hole, which leads to a corrugation (at low altitudes) of the separatrix surfaces that separate open from closed magnetic flux. Interchange reconnection is induced
both at the null points and separators of the pseudostreamer, and at the global helmet streamer. Wedemonstrate that a preferential occurrence of interchange reconnection in the “lanes” between our driving cells leads to a filamentary pattern of newly-opened flux in the heliosphere. These flux bundles connect to but extend far from the separatrix-web (S-Web) arcs at the source surface. We propose that the pattern of granular and supergranular flows on the photosphere should leave an observable imprint in the heliosphere."

Updates to ORDEM utilize the most recent validated datasets from radar, optical, and in situ sources to provide estimates of the debris flux as a function of size, material density, impact speed, and direction along a mission orbit. On-going efforts within the NASA ODPO to update the next version of ORDEM include a new parameter that highly affects the damage risk – shape. Shape can be binned by material density and size to better understand the damage assessments on spacecraft. The in situ and laboratory research activities at the NASA ODPO are focused on cataloging and characterizing fragments from a laboratory hypervelocity-impact test using a high-fidelity, mock-up satellite, DebriSat, in controlled and instrumented laboratory conditions. DebriSat is representative of present-day, low Earth orbit satellites, having been constructed with modern spacecraft materials and techniques. The DebriSat fragment ensemble provides a variety of shapes, bulk densities, and dimensions. Fragments down to 2 mm in size are being characterized by their physical and derived properties. A subset of fragments is being analyzed further in NASA’s Optical Measurement Center (OMC) using broadband, bidirectional reflectance measurements to provide insight into the optical-based NASA Size Estimation Model. Additionally, pre-impact spectral measurements on a subset of DebriSat materials were acquired for baseline material characterization. This paper provides an overview of DebriSat, the status of the project, and ongoing fragment characterization efforts within the OMC."

The infiltration times varied between 1800 and 7200 s, which did not have any significant effect on the volume fraction of voids filled with the metal. Optical and scanning electron microscopy, back scattered electron imaging, energy dispersion spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the infiltrated preforms. A plot of the volume fraction of open voids infiltrated against the absolute melt infiltration temperature showed a sharp peak at 1773 K with almost complete infiltration of the voids at this temperature. The extent of silicide infiltration of the preforms dropped steeply above 1773 K with increasing melt infiltration temperature irrespective of the amount of infiltration time. Above 1805 K, the volume fraction of voids infiltrated with the melt was nearly 0%. It is demonstrated that CrSi2 did not show evidence of a reaction with the SiC fibers. The possibility that a resisting force due to contact angle hysteresis (CAH) may have influenced the diminishing amount of voids filled with increasing temperature above 1773 K was examined. The resistance force was estimated to be extremely small to be consequential. Another possibility that the CrSi2 may have decomposed into Cr(g) and Si(g) in the vacuum melt infiltration furnace appeared to be more plausible based on thermodynamic analyses. An empirical equation is proposed to calculate the amount of remaining charge left to infiltrate the preforms at the infiltration temperature. It is shown that an initial charge of 10 g would rationalize the present observations. While the decomposition of the CrSi2 appeared to mostly explain the present results, some discrepancies were observed, which were inconsistent with the decomposition model."

microanalyzer (EPMA) for obtaining Mg/Ca ratios in individual foraminifera shells. The goal is to assess the use of EPMA as an alternative technique for Mg/Ca analyses of single foraminiferal calcite shells. Foraminifera obtained from sediments (benthic, Uvigerina spp.) and from plankton tows (planktonic,
Orbulina universa) were analyzed. All specimens were prepared in epoxy mounts and exposed in cross-section such that multiple high-resolution analyses could be completed on the shells using both techniques. We examined our data using statistical methods designed for the assessment and comparison of measurement techniques. In the case of Uvigerina, the mean difference for ratios obtained using EPMA and LA-ICP-MS is very small (−0.046 mmol mol−1) and scale independent. The Limits of Agreement (LoA,
the standard deviation of the bias plus the mean bias) is [−0.315, 0.223] mmol mol−1. For samples with ratios lower than 13 mmol mol−1, we found a mean EPMA–LA-ICP-MS bias of −2.44 mmol mol−1 and a corresponding LoA of [−3.85, −1.04] mmol mol−1. For ratios higher than 13 mmol mol−1, there appears to be a scale dependent bias, meaning that the EPMA measured ratios become progressively larger than those of LA-ICP-MS as the Mg/Ca ratio increases, so the mean bias and LoA metrics are not meaningful.
Results indicate that it is possible to use EPMA to collect Mg/Ca data, if the ratios are lower than ∼13 mmol mol−1."

Many transient scientific events of interest occur randomly and the scientific value of follow-up observations decays with time. As a result, transient science operations among distributed observatories require timely access to communications network services. This paper develops two complimentary methods to improve users’ network access timeliness using the NASA Space Network (SN). Descriptive models of each method are developed using Systems Modeling Language. Pathfinder experiments are designed and executed. Suitability of the methods is discussed in light of the experimental results. Innovative applications of the methods are presented. This research establishes that the as-built SN systems have adequate capabilities and capacity to support infusion of the methods to current and future users with emergent time-sensitive service needs. The minimum service access wait time was determined to be approximately 10 min and is achievable 84% of the time. An average access wait time of approximately 14 min is expected when SN resource blocking occurs. A roadmap to improve SN access timeliness is presented."

A liquid has no lattice structure as crystalline solids and the atoms/molecules in the liquid can migrate through it relatively rapidly. On the other hand, it is also interacting with many other atoms/molecules so that the simplifications of the kinetic theory of gases cannot be employed. For more complicated liquids, such as the liquids of high ionicity and those containing hydrogen bonds and electric dipoles, the understanding is far from complete.  At the same time, accurate information on the physics and chemistry of semiconductor melts is needed for the quantitative descriptions of the process of crystal growth from melt. The pre-crystallization phenomena in the liquid phase are critical because the properties of the grown crystals depend on the state and structure of the melt as well as the thermal history of the melt during solidification process. However, the data on the liquid phase, such as thermophysical properties of semiconductor melts are scarce, especially for the HgTe-based II-VI ternary compound semiconductors because of their high vapor pressure and extreme toxicity. Analysis of the thermophysical properties of the melt can provide information about structural transitions of the melt during the solidification process. From a broader point of view, the structure of liquids is much more complicated than the crystalline solids, especially the relaxation behavior through different thermal histories. The theory of hetero-phase fluctuations of liquids is applicable to any many-body systems including condensed-matter physics, field theory, physics of nuclear-matter, cosmology, biology and even sociology. 

This book summarizes the physics and chemistry from the experimental measurements and theoretical analyses of phase diagram, thermodynamic properties, density, thermal conductivity, viscosity, and electrical conductivity on the binary, pseudo-binary and ternary melts of the most advanced IR-detector material systems of HgCdTe and HgZnTe as well as the analyses of these results. The main objectives of this study are: 
(1) to provide the phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties of Hg-Cd-Te and Hg-Zn-Te systems through quantitatively fitting the experimental data by assuming an associated solution model for the liquid phase, 
(2) to experimentally measure the thermophysical properties of the Hg-Cd-Te and Hg-Zn-Te melts, including density, viscosity, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity as functions of temperature and composition and
(3) to enhance the fundamental knowledge of hetero-phase fluctuations and relaxation phenomena in the melts and extend our understanding of the solidification process in order to interpret the experimental results of crystal growth so as to improve the melt growth processes of the compound semiconductor. 
The physics and chemistry of Te and HgTe-based ternary melts were explored through the studies of the structural transformation during melting, the supercooling during solidification, the relaxation phenomena after rapid cooling of the melts and the metal-semiconductor transition in the melts through the analyses of electrical conductivity and Lorenz number. An in-depth study on the thermophysical properties and their time-dependent structural dynamic processes taking place in the vicinity of the solid-liquid phase transition of the narrow homogeneity range HgTe-based ternary semiconductors as well as the analysis of the homogenization process in the melt will also be presented."

The mission consists of  a constellation of  six, three-unit (3U) CubeSats (approximately 10×10×34 cm), each hosting a 12-channel PMW spectrometer based on the Micro-sized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite-2 (MicroMAS-2) developed at MIT LL, but with a substantially improved design. TROPICS will provide imagery near 91 and 205 GHz, temperature sounding near 118 GHz, and moisture sounding near 183 GHz. Spatial resolution at nadir will be around 27 km for temperature and 17 km for moisture and precipitation with a swath width of  approximately 2,000 km from a 550-km orbit altitude. Both the spatial resolution and swath width are similar to the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) that is being flown as part of  the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). In addition, TROPICS meets many of  the requirements outlined in the 2007 Decadal Survey for the Precision and All-Weather Tempera-ture and Humidity (PATH) mission, which was originally envisioned as a microwave instrument in geostationary orbit. TROPICS enables temporal resolution approaching that of  geostationary orbit but at a much lower cost, demonstrating a technology that could impact the design of  future Earth-observing missions. The satellites for the TROPICS mission were delivered to NASA in 2019 for launches planned in the 2021–2022 timeframe. The primary mission objective of  TROPICS is to relate temperature, humidity, and precipitation structure to the evolution of  tropical cyclone (TC) intensity."

By modeling both the hot plasma emission and the continuum absorption of the soft X-rays by the cool, partially ionized bulk of the wind we derive the temperature distribution of the shock-heated plasma and the wind mass-loss rate of each star. We find a similar temperature distribution for each star’s hot wind plasma, consistent with a power-law differential emission measure, dlogEMdlogT, with a slope a little steeper than -2, up to temperatures of only about107K. The wind mass-loss rates, which are derived from the broadband X-ray absorption signatures in the spectra, are consistent with those found from other diagnostics. The most notable conclusion of this study is that wind absorption is a very important effect, especially at longer wavelengths. More than 90 per cent of the X-rays between 18 and 25 ̊A produced by shocks in the wind of ζPup are absorbed, for example. It appears that the empirical trend of X-ray hardness with spectral subtype among O stars is primarily an absorption effect."

ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) is a 5-year NASA EVS-2 (Earth Venture Suborbital-2) investigation with three intensive observation periods designed to study key atmospheric processes that determine the climate impacts
of these aerosols. During the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring (June–October), aerosol particles reaching 3–5 km in altitude are transported westward over the southeast Atlantic, where they interact with one of the largest subtropical stratocumulus (Sc) cloud decks in the world. The representation of these interactions in climate models remains highly uncertain in part due to a scarcity of observational constraints on aerosol and cloud properties, as well
as due to the parameterized treatment of physical processes. Three ORACLES deployments by the NASA P-3 aircraft in September 2016, August 2017, and October 2018 (totaling ~ 350 science flight hours), augmented by the deployment of the NASA ER-2 aircraft for remote sensing in September 2016 (totaling ~ 100 science flight hours), were intended to help fill this observational gap. ORACLES focuses on three fundamental science themes centered on the climate effects of African BB aerosols: (a) direct aerosol radiative effects, (b) effects of aerosol absorption on atmospheric circulation and clouds, and (c) aerosol–cloud microphysical interactions. This paper summarizes the ORACLES science objectives, describes the project implementation, provides an overview of the flights and measurements in each deployment, and highlights the integrative modeling efforts from cloud to global scales to address science objectives. Significant new findings on the vertical structure of BB aerosol physical and chemical properties, chemical aging, cloud condensation nuclei, rain and precipitation statistics, and aerosol indirect effects are emphasized, but their detailed descriptions are the subject of separate publications. The main purpose of this paper is to familiarize the broader scientific community with the ORACLES project and the dataset it produced."

It is currently unknown what triggers these events, how long they last and how they are connected to the physical properties of the inner accretion flows. Previously, only two such sources were known, found either serendipitously or in archival data, with emission lines in their optical spectra classifying their nuclei as hosting an actively accreting supermassive black hole. Here we present the detection of QPEs in two further galaxies, obtained with a blind and systematic search over half of the X-ray sky. The optical spectra of these galaxies show no signature of black hole activity, indicating that a pre-existing accretion flow typical of active nuclei is not required to trigger these events. Indeed, the periods, amplitudes and profiles of the newly discovered QPEs are inconsistent with current models that invoke radiation-pressure driven accretion disk instabilities. Instead, QPEs might be driven by an orbiting compact object. Furthermore, their observed properties require the
mass of the secondary object to be much smaller than the main body and future X-ray observations may constrain possible changes in the period due to orbital evolution. This scenario could make QPEs a viable candidate for the electromagnetic counterparts of the so-called extreme mass ratio inspirals, with considerable implications for multi-messenger astrophysics and cosmology."

In a remediation project, treated groundwater was distributed through an exfiltration gallery into intact scrub. We established eight permanent line-intercept transects (15 m length) in the site in April 2002, four close to the exfiltration gallery and four more distant from it. We sampled vegetation, < 0.5 m and ≥ 0.5 m, along each transect and measured vegetation height at four points (0, 5, 10, 15 m) annually through 2019. The initial phase of the project operated from October 2002 to early March 2004 (494 days) and distributed 1.74 x 108 L of water. The final phase of the project occurred from March 2005 through August 2008 (1251 days) and distributed 1.90 x 108 L of water. Pumping raised the water table near the exfiltration gallery. Vegetation height did not differ between the near and far transects initially. Vegetation height increased in the near transects by 2004 with the greatest percent change in 2003 and 2004 as did total cover ≥ 0.5 m. Total cover < 0.5 m and bare ground were similar initially in the near and far transects and declined in the near transects by 2004. Scrub species, particularly the dominant scrub oaks, increased height and cover in response to water additions with no loss of dominant scrub species and no establishment of mesophytes. Hurricane Frances (September 2004) reduced cover ≥ 0.5 m the following year. Hurricane Matthew (October 2016) and Hurricane Irma (September 2017) caused greater damage including breaking limbs as reflected in reduced height and total cover ≥ 0.5 m probably because the older, taller scrub was more vulnerable to wind damage."

Operating at the photon background limit, OSS covers the 25- to 588-μm wavelength range instantaneously at a resolving power (R) of 300 using six logarithmically spaced grating modules. Each module couples at least 30 and up to 100 spatial beams simultaneously, enabling true [three-dimensional (3D)] spectral mapping. In addition, OSS provides two high-resolution modes. The first inserts a long-path Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) into a portion of the incoming light in advance of the grating backends, enabling R up to 43,000 × [λ/112 μm]  , while preserving the grating-based sensitivity for line detection. The second incorporates a scanning etalon in series with the FTS to provide R up to 300,000 for the 100-to 200-μm range."

The advent of high-quality polarimetric
data has permitted the use of statistical methods to extract both the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field.
In this work, the Davis–Chandrasekhar–Fermi technique is used to make maps of the plane-of-sky (POS)
component of the magnetic field in the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-1) by combining polarization maps at 53,
89, 154 and 214 μm from HAWC+/SOFIA with maps of density and velocity dispersion. In addition, maps of the
local dispersion of polarization angles are used in conjunction with Zeeman measurements to estimate a map of the
strength of the line-of-sight (LOS) component of the field. Combining these maps, information about the threedimensional magnetic field configuration (integrated along the LOS) is inferred over the OMC-1 region. POS
magnetic field strengths of up to 2 mG are observed near the BN/KL object, while the OMC-1 bar shows strengths
of up to a few hundred μG. These estimates of the magnetic field components are used to produce maps of the
mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio (M/Φ)—a metric for probing the conditions for star formation in molecular clouds—
and determine regions of sub- and supercriticality in OMC-1. Such maps can provide invaluable input and
comparison to MHD simulations of star formation processes in filamentary structures of molecular clouds.

Long-term timeseries of high-resolution satellite data are essential to characterize it within land surface models and assess its contribution to surface temperature changes. The potential for additional surface warming from urbanization-induced land use change is investigated and de-coupled from that due to change in climate over the continental US using a decadal timescale.  We show that, aggregated over the US, the summer mean urban-induced surface temperature increased by 0.15°C, with a warming of 0.24°C in cities built in vegetated areas and a cooling of 0.25°C in cities built in non-vegetated arid areas.  This temperature change is comparable in magnitude to the 0.13°C/decade global warming trend observed over the last 50 years caused by increased CO2. We also show that the effect of urban-induced change on surface temperature is felt above and beyond that of the CO2 effect. Our results suggest that climate mitigation policies must consider urbanization feedback to put a limit on the worldwide mean temperature increase."

MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra (T)and Aqua (A) platforms have been a versatile sensor for well over 21 and 18 years respectively and have been extremely useful in the retrieval of aerosol information over the entire globe. The MODIS radiances from the Level1B in general are expected to be within 5% accuracy in the reflective wavelengths and within 1% in the thermal emissive wavelengths. In this paper, we evaluate the sensitivity of previously developed dust detection technique based on thermal emissive wavelengths, which correspond to MODIS bands 20, 29, 31, and 32 respectively. The Thermal Emissive Dust Index (TEDI) performed very comparably to the traditional Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) retrievals by MODIS reflective channels. Since the MODIS Thermal Emissive Bands (TEB) are well calibrated on-orbit using a BlackBody (BB) source, the calibration of these long wave infrared bands is quite robust. As A-MODIS continues to perform well beyond its designed lifetime of 6 years, the instrument has undergone various levels of degradation during its mission time. As a consequence, it is imperative to check the impacts of calibration on the higher-level retrievals. In this paper, we rigorously analyze the sensitivity of TEDI due to the impact of calibration by the afore-mentioned TEB. The perturbation of the dominant (linear) calibration term demonstrated the following: first, there was a correlation in the sensitivity of the TEDI due to the uncertainty in the linear calibration term. Based on a perturbation in the linear calibration term for all aforementioned bands over a range of ± 5 % yielded the TEDI sensitivity to vary from approximately -3.2 % to about -3.6 %. When considering the uncertainty in each individual band significant changes were observed. The least change was observed for the perturbation in the calibration of band 20 with the TEDI sensitivity and the largest sensitivity in TEDI was observed in the perturbation of band 31 calibration. Thus, in the case of TEDI, noticeable sensitivity due to calibration uncertainty was observed in bands 29, 31, and 32, reiterating the importance of the TEB calibration in these bands. Also, the dust detection scheme based on A-MODIS was successfully transferred to the follow-on sensors such as Suomi (SNPP) and NOAA 20 (N20) VIIRS. The results presented in this paper would be extremely helpful in understanding impacts of calibration on the higher-level products for both current and future missions based on the MODIS heritage. Finally, the work also identifies the importance of radiometric fidelity in maintaining the accuracy of the dust detection. Results presented will show drastic improvement of the Saharan dust detection after the reduction of the electronic crosstalk in the 8.5 μm channel of T-MODIS."

However, the potential for irrigation to contribute to global crop yields remains uncertain. Here, we quantify this contribution for wheat and maize at global scale by developing a Bayesian framework integrating empirical estimates and gridded global crop models on new maps of the relative difference between attainable rainfed and irrigated yield (ΔY). At global scale, ΔY is 34 ± 9% for wheat and 22 ± 13% for maize, with large spatial differences driven more by patterns of precipitation than that of evaporative demand. Comparing irrigation demands with renewable water supply, we find 30–47% of contemporary rainfed agriculture of wheat and maize cannot achieve yield gap closure utilizing current river discharge, unless more water diversion projects are set in place, putting into question the potential of irrigation to mitigate climate change impacts."

In recent years, due to overexploitation of water for irrigation, the Katuma River dried out for up to four months per year and this greatly degraded the KNP ecosystem, the siltation of river lead to flooding of the adjacent areas during heavy rains, and the water level of Lake Rukwa has decreased by 4 m since 1992 while its fishery yield and water quality also deteriorated. In 2016, a total of 46 illegal weirs were removed from the Katuma River upstream of KNP. Following that, the river zero-flow periods were reduced by two months and Lake Rukwa water level rose by 1 m. We suggest that the construction of a low V-notch weir at the outlet of the Lake Katavi wetlands would further reduce the Katuma River zero-flow periods by an additional month, thus returning the river nearly to its former perennial status. The enforcement of regulations governing the construction of irrigation weirs is essential. These ecohydrology solutions do not eliminate the threats, but they amplify the opportunities for sustainable development at the basin scale. This example of active governance of water resources at the basin scale can be applied throughout Tanzania and in semi-arid East Africa in general."

To support the Global Burden of Disease Study, we produce yearly fine resolution global surface ozone estimates from 1990 to 2017 through a data fusion of observations and models. As ozone observations are sparse in many populated regions, we use a novel combination of the M3Fusion and Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) methods.  With M3Fusion, we create a multi-model composite by bias-correcting and weighting nine global atmospheric chemistry models based on their ability to predict observations (8,834 sites globally)in each region and year. BME is then used to integrate observations, such that estimates match observations at each monitoring site with the observational influence decreasing smoothly across space and time until the output matches the multi-model composite. After estimating at 0.5° resolution using BME, we add fine spatial detail from an additional model, yielding estimates at 0.1° resolution.  Observed ozone is predicted more accurately (R2=0.81 at test point, 0.63 at 0.1°,0.62 at 0.5°) than the multi-model mean (R2=0.28 at 0.5°).

The lidar samples the shape of the 1572.33 nm CO2 absorption line at 15 or 30 wavelengths. The algorithm uses a least-squares fit between the CO2 line shape computed from a layered 10 atmosphere model to that sampled by the lidar. In addition to the column average CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2), several other parameters are also solved simultaneously from the fit. These include the Doppler shift in the received laser signal wavelengths, the product of the surface reflectivity and atmospheric transmission and a linear trend in the lidar receiver’s spectral response. The algorithm can also be used to solve for the average water vapor mixing ratio, which causes a secondary absorption in the wings of the CO2 absorption line under high humidity conditions. The least-squares fit is linearized about the 15 expected XCO2 value which allows the use of a standard linear least-squares fitting method and software tools. The standard deviation of the retrieved XCO2 is obtained from covariance matrix of the fit. An averaging kernel is defined similarly to that used for passive trace-gas sounding. Examples are presented of using the algorithm to retrieve XCO2 from the measurements from NASA Goddard’s airborne CO2 Sounder lidar made at a constant altitude and during spiral-down maneuvers."

Many satellite sensors operating over the last 50 years have provided data for a range of techniques, algorithms and schemes developed to generate quantitative precipitation estimates.

The controls (ignition, fan speed, etc.) are operated by an astronaut while the principal investigator team monitors the experiment from the ground and communicates directly with the astronaut. For the first time on ISS, BASS–II utilized MSG working volume dilution with gaseous N2. We developed a perfectly stirred reactor model to determine the N2 flow time and flow rate to obtain the desired reduced O2 concentration in the working volume for each test. We calibrated the model with the Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products (CSA-CP) O2 readings offset using the Major Constituents Analyzer reading of the ISS ambient atmosphere data for that day. This worked out extremely well for operations, and added a new vital variable, ambient O2 level, to our test matrices. The main variables tested in BASS–II were ambient O2 concentration, ventilation flow velocity, and fuel type, thickness, and geometry. BASS–II also utilized the onboard CSA-CP for O2 and CO readings, and the Carbon Dioxide Monitor for CO2 readings before and after each test. Readings from these sensors allow us to evaluate the completeness of the combustion. The O2 and CO2 readings before and after each test were analyzed and compared very well to stoichiometric ratios for a one-step gas-phase reaction. The CO versus CO2 followed a linear trend for some datasets, but not for all the different geometries of fuel and flow tested. We calculated the heat release rates during each test from the O2 consumption and burn times, using the constant 13.1 kJ of heat released per gram of O2 consumed. The results showed that most of the tests had heat release rates well below 100 W. Lastly, the global equivalence ratio for the tests is estimated to be fuel rich, 1.3 on average using mass loss and O2 consumption data."

This apparatus   allows  for  measurements   at   approximately  twice   the   temperature of previously published high temperature free-space measurement systems while maintaining   similar   precision.   Challenges were   addressed   related   to   high   temperature measurements,  including temperature uniformity, the accuracy of temperature measurements, and preventing temperature related changes to mm-wave measurement systems. The details of complex permittivity extraction from the measured S-parameters are discussed. Sources of error related to permittivity measurement and mathematical models were identified and are discussed in  detail herein.  Thermally-cycled,  mm-wave  absorbing,  aluminum  nitride  ceramic  composites  containing varying levels of molybdenum additives were measured over the range of 25-1000 °C. These  measurements  were  compared  to  the  same  composites  before  thermal  cycling.  It  was found  that  ceramic  composites  are  largely  stable  after  thermal  cycling  in  terms  of  dielectric  properties despite the presence of visible surface modifications."

These studies determined the abundances of several volatiles, including C2H2, C2H6, CH3OH, NH3, HCN, H2CO, and H2O. Long-slit spatial distributions of gas rotational temperature and column density are diagnostic for the presence of icy grains in the coma and understanding if different volatiles are associated with common or distinct outgassing sources. These spatial distributions suggest that C2H2, C2H6, and HCN have a common outgassing source, whereas H2O and CH3OH have additional, more extended sources. The synergy of these findings with observations by space missions (Rosetta and EPOXI) motivates continuing studies to address whether or not C2H6, C2H2, and HCN have a common source of release (plausibly associated with CO2) in a larger sample of comets and whether systematic differences exist in the release of these species compared to H2O and CH3OH. Abundances of volatiles are reported relative to H2O, as traditionally done, as well as C2H6. While not unique, the choice of C2H6 demonstrates the value of extending the chemical taxonomy of parent volatiles in comets toward additional compositional ""baselines"" and, importantly, closer integration between coma abundances and the underlying volatile associations as revealed by spatial distributions. Our findings on composition and sources of outgassing include information relevant to future evaluations of 46P/Wirtanen as a prospective spacecraft target."

These faculty engineers and scientists worked with NASA collaborators on NASA projects, bringing new perspectives and solutions to bear. This Technical Memorandum is a
compilation of nine research reports of the 2020 Marshall Aerospace Fellowship program, along with the Program Announcement (Appendix A) and the Program Description (Appendix B). The research affected the following five areas:

    (1) Materials
    (2) Spacecraft systems
    (3) Human-System Interactions
    (4) Vehicle systems
    (5) Space science

Additive manufacturing was the single materials investigation during the summer of 2020. Spacecraft systems tasks dominated the fellows’ explorations: covering camera sensors for lunar surface mobility, a real-time system for navigation and mapping, flexible sensor modeling, and transmitter design for high data rate telemetry. One project concentrated on Human-System Interactions. Another fellow designed a model to predict heat leak into a cryogen tank, as in most vehicle systems. One of the scientists worked on a proposed space-based gravitational wave interferometer that will detect Galactic white dwarf binaries. Another space science fellow used a mature astrophysical code to synthesize galactic stellar populations. Our goal is to continue the Marshall Aerospace Program funded by Center project offices."

Measurements from surface-based instruments are essentially limited to populated regions, necessitating the use of satellite-based observations to provide estimates of precipitation across the whole of the Earth’s surface. The temporal and spatial variability of precipitation requires adequate sampling, especially at finer resolutions. It is therefore necessary to exploit all available data from precipitation-capable satellites to ensure the proper representation of precipitation. To date, the estimation of precipitation using passive microwave observations has been largely concentrated upon the conically-scanning imaging instruments, with relatively few techniques exploiting the observations made from the cross-track sounders. This paper describes the development of the Precipitation Retrieval and Profiling Scheme (PRPS) to retrieve precipitation from cross-track sensors, together with its performance against surface radar data and other satellite precipitation retrievals."

Observations obtained from this instrument provide information on boundary layer activity. As an extension of previous work, we have retrieved ICK-by-ICK vertical temperature profiles to characterize turbulent behavior at each rover site for up to two Mars Years. We have also retrieved ICK-by-ICK near-surface (1.1 m) atmospheric temperatures and surface temperatures from dedicated atmospheric observations as well as geologic observations that extend the coverage of near-surface observations. The extension and increased frequency of retrievals as well as the additional observations provide a more complete view of the vertical and temporal variation of temperature fluctuations within the PBL. Temperature fluctuations are assessed using detrended temperature time-series data. The results show fluctuations can be as large as 10 K at the surface and 8 K aloft with timescales on the order of minutes. We have calculated the peak-to-peak amplitudes of temperature fluctuations and the corresponding timescales over which they occur. Spirit and Opportunity temperature fluctuation amplitudes decrease in magnitude vertically, where higher atmospheric levels show smaller fluctuations in amplitudes than at the surface. The magnitude of temperature fluctuations changes with the difference in surface and air temperature. This difference varies little as a function of season at both rover sites. Fluctuations are observed to quickly decrease in the late afternoon reaching a minimum near 17:00 LTST followed by moderately increased activity near sunset caused by forced convection. There is no significant change in the observed convective activity as a function of dust optical depth during regional dust storms. The few large temperature fluctuations that are concurrent with dust events are likely the result of large-scale systems."

Development and improvements to fabrication of polyimide aerogel thin films have been reported over the last decade to meet the needs of many of these applications. However, most starting materials are expensive. In this research, we utilized commercially available, low cost monomers including 4,4’-bis(4-aminophenoxy)propane (BAPP) and 3,3’,4,4’-benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA), and 4,4-methylene diphenyl di-isocyanate (MDI) in fabricating polyimide (PI) and polyimide-urea (PIU), which were then cross-linked with 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenoxy)benzene (TAB). It was found that the addition of MDI into the PI chains not only maintained the flexibility of the aerogel films, but also enhanced the film casting, allowing the production on pilot scale. With the capability in producing robust films at affordable cost, application of the PIU aerogel films can be expanded to terrestrial goods such as winter clothing, or pipe wrapping, etc. In addition, the presence of only a small addition of the urea links in the polyimide chains in PIU aerogels led to lower shrinkage when compared to the corresponding PI aerogels, leading to lower density"

The structural changes in the vicinity of the solid-liquid phase transition of elemental Te and various Hg1-xCdxTe solid solutions were assessed by closely examining these experimental properties and the derived Lorenz numbers. The values of Lorenz numbers for the solids of these samples were higher than the value of L0, i.e., the Lorenz number for the free electron gas derived by Sommerfeld, implying the characteristics of non-degenerate semiconductor. With the increasing value of x, or the larger bandgap, the materials become more non-degenerate with larger deviation from L0. As the solids started to melt, the measured values of Lorenz number for all samples started to decrease and eventually reached and maintained at values close to L0 at higher temperatures. The trend of the Lorenz number indicates that the transition from non-degenerate semiconductor of the solid samples to metal or degenerate semiconductor when the samples temperature reached above their liquidus temperatures."

The method involves the estimation of two chosen reference moments from two specific DPR products, namely the attenuation-corrected Ku-band radar reflectivity and (if made available) the specific attenuation at Ka-band.  The reference moments are then combined with a function representing the underlying shape of the DSD based on the generalized gamma model. Simulations are performed to quantify the algorithm errors.  The performance of methodology is assessed with two GPM-DPR overpass cases over disdrometer sites, one in Huntsville, Alabama and one in Delmarva peninsula, Virginia, both in the US. Results are promising and indicate that it is feasible to estimate DSD moments directly from DPR-based quantities."

To perform this exploration the mission will be required to last at least 50 years in regions of space where solar power is no longer practical. Additionally, several new studies for the National Academies’ Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey are planning missions lasting 20-35 years. The Decadal Survey is used to build consensus on priority of national science goals. These proposed missions are inconsistent with the NASA’s current Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) life requirement of 14 years (flight). Paramount to these proposed long-duration missions are questions about the longevity of such a mission. Evidence exists that space-borne Radioisotope Power Systems can indeed last a long time. LES-9, Voyager I, and Voyager II are over 40 years old, LES-8, Pioneer 10, and Pioneer 11 lasted 28, 30, and 22 years, respectively, and New Horizons is still active 15 years after launch. This paper explores the need for RPS designs that are intended to last much longer than the current requirement of 14 years (17 years after fueling) and explores the historical record for actual vs design lifetimes to show the feasibility of building long lasting RPS. We also exercise a current RTG performance model of the General-Purpose Heat Source RTG using the JPL Lifetime Performance Prediction (LPP) tool to make top-level inferences about power output at end-of-mission, and discusses how reliability engineering and testing methods can be brought to bear to increase confidence in delivering sufficient power at end-of-mission."

As part of a multiyear upgrade in automation of the network, the DSN has undertaken a series of operations efficiency improvements which has fundamentally changed the operations paradigm of the network. At the start of this effort, each site operated only their local antennas and equipment 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, and each spacecraft activity (link) had a single dedicated Link Control Operator. In its final stage, realized in 2020, each one of the three sites operates the entire network during their local day shift, handing off control to the next site as their day ends, and tracks can be run in a fully automated manner with no operator intervention. This paradigm change has realized significant operations cost savings, but has posed some major challenges along the way. This paper describes the system changes that enabled the operations efficiency improvements, some the challenges, and plans for the future."

This proposed system offers a combined thermal and electrical power source to support survival of spacecraft operating in extreme low temperature lunar environments, without the use of radioisotope-based sources. A conceptual design study has been completed for this system, that uses heat generated by an exothermic chemical reaction in place of radioisotope or electrical heat sources. The goal of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of such a system through thermodynamic and chemical analysis and thermal modeling, and to identify technology gaps to inform a technology development and maturation plan. The specific technical objectives focused on delivery of 90 to 100 Wth thermal power and 30 to 40 We electrical power for 336 hours to a representative Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) lander, to support lunar surface survival and limited operations through a lunar night. The total system mass was targeted at ≤50 kg. A highly exothermic chemical reaction system is used to generate on-board electrical power for spacecraft systems, and thermal power to maintain critical spacecraft/lander systems within their allowable flight temperature (AFTs). Based on the very high energy content of the chemical reaction system, a much higher amount of heat per unit mass can be delivered to the spacecraft, relative to a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and electrical heater(s). Since radioisotope heaters or generators are not used, the system will be orders of magnitude lower in cost than a radioisotope heating/power unit, without the attendant regulatory complexities. As part of the CHIPS concept, a fraction of the thermal power generated is converted to electrical power via an appropriate thermal-to-electric converter technology (such as a free piston Stirling converter or a thermoelectric generator module), to provide power to critical loads. This approach is ideally suited to support operation of commercial landers (e.g., via the CLPS program). In most cases, these landers are only designed to operate during a portion of the lunar day, with no provision for survival through the lunar night. By supporting lunar night survival, a mission can be extended through the lunar night and at least into another lunar day, thus turning a nominal eight-day mission into a 36-day mission. Therefore, the current system demonstration will focus on scalability to support at least 336 hours (one lunar night) of continuous thermal and electrical power generation. Although initially targeted to support lunar equatorial landings, the technology is extensible to missions at the lunar poles, other extreme environments in the Solar System or even air-independent applications on Earth (e.g., ocean exploration)."

In contrast, the self-driving vehicles on Mars, including NASA’s latest rover, Perseverance, which is planned to land on Mars in February 2021, are still driven by classical machine vision systems. Deep learning capabilities, such as semantic segmentation and object recognition, would substantially benefit the safety and productivity of ongoing and future missions to the red planet. To this end, we created the first large-scale dataset, AI4Mars, for training and validating terrain classification models for Mars, consisting of ~326K semantic segmentation full image labels on 35K images from Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers, collected through crowdsourcing. Each image was labeled by ~10 people to ensure greater quality and agreement of the crowdsourced labels. It also includes ~1.5K validation labels annotated by the rover planners and scientists from NASA’s MSL (Mars Science Laboratory) mission, which operates the Curiosity rover, and MER (Mars Exploration Rovers) mission, which operated the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. We trained a DeepLabv3 model on the AI4Mars training dataset and achieved over 96% overall classification accuracy on the test set. The dataset is made publicly available.1"

The increased focus on the Moon as a destination for future human and robotic expeditions necessitates general purpose navigational and communications infrastructure reducing their complexity to help establish a sustained presence. A framework through which Lunar missions can relay communications and localize their positions shifts the burden from the individual mission and enables resource allocation tailored to mission-specific goals. During the summer of 2020, student interns under the Innovation to Flight (i2F) program at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in collaboration with the University of Colorado Boulder designed, built, and tested a prototype framework capable of providing surface assets with communication and positioning services. The team utilized the existing i2F CubeSat bus in addition to developing several CubeSat engineering development units (EDUs), a ground vehicle, and a ground station to simulate a scenario in which a lunar surface mission is supported by these services. A primary goal of the summer was to develop a method for localizing the ground vehicle through trilateration. Distances are inferred from the round-trip time of flight (ToF) of radio signals between an asset and several elements. Signals were sent and received using LimeSDR software defined radios on-board both the ground vehicle and the EDUs; ToF and trilateration were calculated on a Qualcomm Snapdragon development board located within the LA MOON payload data system. The ModalAI chipset on the Qualcomm was instrumental in executing visual based position estimation. Communications was facilitated through a bent-pipe approach addressing the NASA requirement to provide solutions for in communication denied locations. The ground vehicle relayed information to other surface assets in addition to its ground station through the supporting constellation. This project demonstrates the feasibility of a lunar CubeSat constellation for the support of surface assets and explores packaging and operations of the components critical to trilateration and bent-pipe communication into a standard CubeSat form factor. When implemented, this framework will open a door for new surface missions designed with lower power requirements and increased operational access."

The 30-m resolution provides a better scale for studying the phenology variation across elevational gradients than the 500-m resolution, as greenup dates monitored at 30-m scale have better agreement with leaf-out dates recorded in the field alongside the north–south-oriented hiking trails on three of the park’s tallest mountains (466 m, 418 m, and 380 m), and can provide landcover-specific analysis. The spring phenology responses to temperature and elevation vary among different spatial scales. Greenup dates of Acadia National Park monitored at 30-m scale show a weak advancing trend with higher spring temperature, while greenup dates monitored at 500 m show a weak delaying trend. The species mix within landcover at 30-m scale could weaken the advancing trend detected at field observation level. The landcover mix and elevation variation within 500-m scale could alter the spring phenology response to spring temperature variation. Greenup dates monitored at both 30-m and 500-m scales vary among different elevational zones, aspects, landcovers, and years. However, the relationship between greenup dates and elevation is rather weak."
510,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220009421,2023-08-03,Application of Micro-thrusters for Space Observatory Precision Attitude Control,"This paper describes the results of a NASA investigation into the benefits of micro-thrusters compared to reaction wheels on future observatory-class missions with tight pointing stability requirements. Pointing repeatability and stability (i.e., jitter) requirements are key for space telescope missions of the future. For example, managing jitter is essential to being able to “image” planets orbiting distant stars. Jitter requirements for missions in this class are difficult to meet with current reaction wheel-based architectures. The reaction wheels are typically the largest pointing disturbance on the spacecraft. Disturbances from reaction wheels can be mitigated, typically by mechanically isolating the wheels, which imposes system complexity and cost. Thrusters capable of thrust forces in the micronewton (μN) range (referred to as micro-thrusters or micronewton thrusters) have been developed to support the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, which requires drag-free control to place a test mass in near-perfect free-fall Beyond the drag-free control application, micro-thrusters could be used as a substitute for reaction wheels or as a supplement to wheels for fine pointing control. Used in this fashion, micro-thrusters have potential for reducing the cost and technical risks of achieving demanding pointing stability performance on observatory-class missions."

Recently developed waveguideintegrated MEMS phase shifters are paving the way to realize electronic beam-steering using submm-wave phased arrays. In this work, two phased array demonstrators are presented that operate from 500GHz to 600GHz. A 20 dB directivity 8 ? 1 leaky-wave antenna array will be demonstrated, using fixed waveguide feeding networks, to be capable of ?20? scanning with a scan loss less than 1:7 dB. Secondly, an equivalent but smaller 17 dB directivity 4 ? 1 array will be integrated with MEMS phase shifters to demonstrate a dynamic scanning capability over a ?9:5? range. The antenna array is based on closely sampled square waveguides, terminated with a double-iris, in close proximity of a low permittivity superstrate in order to reduce the grating lobes at larger scanning angles. Measurements are expected to be presented at the conference."

Through an internal project known as ARTEMIS, JPL has developed lunar night survivable designs for magnetometer, seismometer, and IR spectrometer science payloads (SPs). These designs incorporate four hyper-isolative thermal management features under development on the NASA GCD-funded PALETTE project: (a) a dual enclosure system with high strength, low k tension cable (TC) supports and a variable conductance thermal link (VCTL) composed of a reverse-operation DTE thermal switch (ROD-TSW) in series with a miniaturized loop heat pipe (mini-LHP); (b) a parabolic reflector radiator (PRR) for low-to-mid latitude lunar sites; (c) ultra-low e* “spacerless” MLI, in which individual layers are hung from the TC supports; and (d) ultra-low G thermal isolators made with polymeric material or polymer/TC assemblies. Each instrument design incorporates solar panels, batteries, telecom, C&DH, and other features necessary for self-sufficient, extended-duration operation on the lunar surface. This paper will provide an overview of the ARTEMIS and PALETTE projects and provide a top-level description of the instrument thermal management approach."

Since a GmAPD detector reports only a binary value and timestamp associated with an avalanche event, dark count rates are typically measured by averaging thousands of frames to support a statistically significant measurement. For both synchronous and asynchronous detector, the Poisson distributed background rates are referenced to the time each pixel is armed. Unlike for synchronous GmAPD imagers where all the pixels are armed to an array-wide arm signal, an asynchronous pixel operates independently from its neighboring pixels; requiring the background rates to be calculated using an interarrival histogram. For both types of imagers, the background rate is typically evaluated by fitting an exponential distribution to a fixed window within a measured histogram of time intervals between detection events However, if the statistics of the background rate are insufficient – whether that is due to low population sizes, saturation, or a large dynamic range of population size across the array, the pixel, or array-wide, performance metrics may report results with varying accuracy. This paper reports on an implementation of an algorithm that evaluates GmAPD background rates based on statistical metrics rather than fixed windows. The algorithm functions by determining the appropriate integration window within the interarrival time histogram based on a per-pixel count rate set by a predetermined tolerable measurement error. The implementation of the algorithm allows us to characterize GmAPD arrays with orders of magnitude spread in background rates across the detector using common statistical parameters."

JPL developed the PIRS - which rolled out in 2018 - to simplify the delivery of JPL’s Personal Property and Equipment (PP&E) reporting: PIRS takes the raw data from Oracle to generate the NASA Form (NF) 1018 and Contractor Held Asset Reporting System (CHATS) Reports, and to meet the requirements established for AS9100 compliance. The data presented from PIRS is exportable and used to analyze our property records. JPL is also embarking on an effort to define the JPL of the future with “Enterprise 2.0”. Enterprise 2.0 is the driving force of JPL’s strategy to digitally transform the Laboratory from the current legacy processes and systems to a modern, integrated, information-driven highway of business transactions. This should include automation of routine processes and data-related tasks, integration of data and systems, advanced search and analytics, and improved information sharing and collaboration. As JPL’s evolving landscape of digital technologies advance to meet the future, JPL Property Accountability is making strides to surpass these expectations. For every cause there is an effect: a revealing of something that aids in the further development and transformation of JPL best business practices."

543,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014468,2023-08-03,A sampling-based optimization approach to handling environmental uncertainty for a planetary lander,"Planning for unknown environments presents a number of technical challenges. The planner must ensure robustness to unknown phenomena and manage unpredictable variation in execution, all while operating in a capacity that maximizes its objective. Productivity in the face of these challenges re-quires an integrated approach to planning and execution that is capable of accomplishing goals, reacting to variation, and maximizing overall utility. We examine this problem in the context of a Europa Lander concept mission. We model the problem as a hierarchical task network, framing it as a utility maximization problem constrained on a depletable energy resource. We propose an uncertainty–sensitive deterministic planning framework that utilizes periodic replanning to better handle model uncertainty and variable execution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through simulations of a Europa Lander concept mission in which our algorithm out-performs several baseline approaches in both utility maximization and robustness"

Uncertainties can arise because of the instruments, communication systems, or external disturbances. Parameter uncertainty can be due to uncertainties in the data or the calibration process used. The objective of this research is to develop a rigid body pose estimation scheme on nonlinear manifolds of rigid body motion groups for unknown mass properties moments of inertia with application in space launch. An unscented Kalman filter is developed on special Euclidean space and their tangent bundle to address uncertainties in the states and inertia properties. This estimator accounts for uncertainties, while considering rotational-translational coupling, and avoids singularity or non-uniqueness issues. Since this estimator is based on the nonlinear manifolds on which rigid body motion evolves, it is reliable and is expected to result in high level of accuracy. The estimators are validated on a generic model of Logistic Module (LM) and a cuboid spacecraft model. The algorithms can then be tested on Dragon XL, HTV-X, and possibly other spacecraft."
545,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220016979,2023-08-03,"Constraining particle acceleration in Sgr A? with simultaneous GRAVITY, Spitzer, NuSTAR, and Chandra observations","We report the time-resolved spectral analysis of a bright near-infrared and moderate X-ray flare of Sgr A⋆. We obtained light curves in the M, K, and H bands in the mid- and near-infrared and in the 2 − 8 keV and 2 − 70 keV bands in the X-ray. The observed spectral slope in the near-infrared band is νLν ∝ ν0.5 ± 0.2; the spectral slope observed in the X-ray band is νLν ∝ ν−0.7 ± 0.5. Using a fast numerical implementation of a synchrotron sphere with a constant radius, magnetic field, and electron density (i.e., a one-zone model), we tested various synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton scenarios. The observed near-infrared brightness and X-ray faintness, together with the observed spectral slopes, pose challenges for all models explored. We rule out a scenario in which the near-infrared emission is synchrotron emission and the X-ray emission is synchrotron self-Compton. Two realizations of the one-zone model can explain the observed flare and its temporal correlation: one-zone model in which the near-infrared and X-ray luminosity are produced by synchrotron self-Compton and a model in which the luminosity stems from a cooled synchrotron spectrum. Both models can describe the mean spectral energy distribution (SED) and temporal evolution similarly well. In order to describe the mean SED, both models require specific values of the maximum Lorentz factor γmax, which differ by roughly two orders of magnitude. The synchrotron self-Compton model suggests that electrons are accelerated to γmax ∼ 500, while cooled synchrotron model requires acceleration up to γmax ∼ 5 × 104. The synchrotron self-Compton scenario requires electron densities of 1010 cm−3 that are much larger than typical ambient densities in the accretion flow. Furthermore, it requires a variation of the particle density that is inconsistent with the average mass-flow rate inferred from polarization measurements and can therefore only be realized in an extraordinary accretion event. In contrast, assuming a source size of 1 RS, the cooled synchrotron scenario can be realized with densities and magnetic fields comparable with the ambient accretion flow. For both models, the temporal evolution is regulated through the maximum acceleration factor γmax, implying that sustained particle acceleration is required to explain at least a part of the temporal evolution of the flare."

These challenges motivate the Deep-Time Digital Earth (DDE) program initiated by the International Union of Geological Sciences and developed in cooperation with national geological surveys, professional associations, academic institutions and scientists around the world. DDE’s mission is to build on previous research to develop a systematic DE knowledge graph, a FAIR data infrastructure that links existing databases and makes dark data visible, and tailored tools for DE data, which are universally accessible. DDE aims to harmonize DE data, share global geoscience knowledge and facilitate data-driven discovery in the understanding of Earth’s evolution."
547,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230002210,2023-08-03,"Anaerobic Expression and Purification of Holo-CCIS, an Artificial Iron-sulfur Protein","Iron-sulfur proteins are ubiquitous among all living organisms and are indispensable for almost all metabolic pathways ranging from photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide cycles. The iron-sulfur clusters primarily serve as electron acceptors and donors and transfer electrons to active sites of various enzymes, thus driving the energy metabolism. Prokaryotes like E. coli have ISC and SUF pathways that help in the assembly and maturation of iron-sulfur proteins. These ironsulfur proteins, especially with [4Fe-4S] clusters, are highly sensitive to molecular oxygen, and it would be advantageous if the de novo proteins and native proteins having iron-sulfur binding sites are expressed and isolated under anaerobic conditions. Bacterially assembled iron-sulfur proteins, when isolated and purified anaerobically, exhibit improved biochemical and biophysical stabilities in comparison to the counterparts expressed and purified aerobically and reconstituted under anaerobic conditions. This protocol outlines the expression and purification of the artificial protein, Coiled-Coil IronSulfur (CCIS). It may be deployed to both natural and artificial [4Fe-4S] proteins when heterologously expressed in E. coli."

obtaining 3-D, time-resolved, non-intrusive, full-domain measurements of crater evolution
during the plume-surface interaction (PSI) process. An atmospheric experimental facility was designed and constructed to facilitate the development of the stereo-photogrammetry technique for PSI applications. Stereo-photogrammetry was then used to measure the dynamic crater evolution process at nozzle heights of 25, 40, 55, and 70 nozzle diameters above the sand simulant bed. From the stereo-photogrammetry data, time-resolved 3-D reconstructions of the crater geometry were generated, and crater depth, radius, and volume time histories were extracted. Crater depth was observed to grow logarithmically for the two highest nozzle heights, and the depth growth rate for the lower two nozzle heights was more rapid. Crater volume growth was well characterized by a power law fit. The slope of the collapsed crater post nozzle flow was found to increase with nozzle height, along with the final crater volume. The results show that stereo-photogrammetry can be used to successfully measure the crater geometry in cases where optical access to the crater is not completely degraded by ejected particles."

This vehicle is based on the principle of a two-part balloon for which pumping helium gas between the balloons can modulate buoyancy and thereby control the altitude of the vehicle. The intended mission application at Venus is a cloud-level exploration across an altitude range of 52 to 62 kilometers for weeks or months, circumnavigating the planet multiple times and carrying an approximately 100 kg payload module containing all scientific instruments, avionics and other vehicle support systems. The first prototype is approximately one-third scale (4 m diameter) and serves as a proof-of-concept test article allowing for evaluation of manufacturing approaches and laboratory testing to evaluate performance. Two key design features of the prototype as built are the use of Teflon film on the outside of the balloon to protect it from the sulfuric acid aerosols in the Venusian atmosphere and second surface metallization of that film to reflect most incident sunlight and thereby limit diurnal temperature and the associated temperature-driven pressure fluctuations. This prototyping effort has been complemented with a detailed vehicle simulation activity that incorporates the relevant balloon physics and thereby models the expected dynamic behavior of the aerobot in both the Earth and Venus atmospheres. Data obtained in laboratory tests of the prototype have been used to validate, verify and update that simulation model as described in the paper."
698,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230006940,2023-08-03,Planet Matching and Orbit Determination in multi-planet systems for Exoplanet Direct Imaging,"A key aspect of the search for Earth-like exoplanets with direct imaging is determining if the exoplanet is in the habitable zone. Future direct imaging mission concepts such as HabEx and LUVOIR require an efficient cadence of observations. Previous work shows that a minimum of three epochs, spanning more than half a period, can determine orbital parameters to 10\% for a single, circular orbit. Multi-planet systems may require a different number and cadence of observations. We begin to address the multi-planet minimum observation approach by considering only the astrometric data of exoplanet candidate objects in high contrast images. Existing multi-planet trajectory matching libraries such as “Orbits For The Impatient” (OFTI) currently require users to specify which point sources belong to which planet and assumes that the user has already matched true-positive detections to planets. Additionally, planet matching needs to be considered when assessing the impact of observation scheduling on trajectory estimation accuracy. To address this need for fitting orbits to multiple objects with limited knowledge, we present an approach using a Monte Carlo study of different observation schedules and planetary systems in which we have developed an algorithm to automatically match observations to planets, and then check the accuracy of the matches. With a large number of cases, we can constrain the number of observations and the spacing necessary to “deconfuse” the detections. We present preliminary planet matching success rates for different observing schedules and planetary system parameters. We use these results to assess the scope of the confusion problem and discuss potential mitigation strategies."

Whether it be power distribution and optical communication connecting robots exploring extreme, undersea and deep subsurface environments, to your home office on Earth, we live, and will continue to live, in a predominantly ‘wired’ world. Accordingly, as humanity continues to push beyond Earth to exploring extreme planetary terrains like caves, cliffs, craters, and crevasses, and moves towards establishing human settlements on the Moon and Mars, we can expect tethers to play a major role. For exploration purposes, tethers are critical to enabling next-generation, science-focused missions to access high-value, resource-limited targets, where exploring rovers or astronauts lack direct communication or access to viable sunlight for solar power. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is formulating new mission concepts that could deploy robotic assets into some of the Solar System’s harshest and steepest terrain and, in many cases, tethers are the enabling technology. Examples include i) a rappelling rover to explore vertically along lunar pit walls to determine how the Moon formed, ii) tethered rovers to reach ice deposits on Mars and the Moon, iii) large, tether-deployed antenna structures to probe into the subsurface of a planet and/or look skyward to image the highly red-shifted, early universe, iv) probes that descend into the icy layers of Europa and Enceladus in search of subsurface oceans and, potentially, extant life, and v) science instruments that could be suspended on supportive tethers from balloons on Venus to directly image the surface and sample its clouds. This paper will present a survey of the state-of-the-art for tether related exploration of the solar system and chronicle ongoing work at JPL, which is leading to robust tether designs, high-power and communication transmission over multi-km distances, and highly capable, tether-based rover systems."

DSN provides radar and radio astronomy observations that enhance our understanding of the solar system and the larger universe. A track is a block of continuous multi-dimensional time series from the beginning to end of DSN communication with the target spacecraft, containing 129 monitor data items lasting several hours at a frequency of 0.2-1Hz. Monitor data on each track reports on the performance of specific spacecraft operations and the DSN itself. DSN is receiving signals from 32 spacecraft across the solar system. DSN has pressure to reduce costs while maintaining the quality of support for DSN mission users. DSN operators need to simultaneously monitor multiple tracks and identify anomalies in real time. DSN has seen that as the number of missions increases, the data that needs to be processed increases over time. In this project, we look at the last 8 years of data for analysis. Any anomaly in the track indicates a problem with either the spacecraft, DSN equipment, or weather conditions. DSN operators typically write “discrepancy reports” for further analysis. It is recognized that it would be quite helpful to identify 10 similar historical tracks out of the huge database to quickly find/match anomalies. This tool has three functions: (1) identification of the top 10 similar historical tracks, (2) detection of anomalies compared to the reference normal track, and (3) comparison of statistical differences between two given tracks. The requirements for these features were confirmed by survey responses from 21 DSN operators and engineers. The preliminary machine learning model has shown promising performance (AUC=0.92). We plan to increase the number of data sets and perform additional testing to improve performance further before its planned integration into the Track Visualizer to assist DSN field operators and engineers."

In recent years, as the network has suffered from increasing oversubscription, more restrictions have been added to reduce the amount of manual scheduling labor necessary to come to consensus. In this paper, we describe a new auto-mated scheduling tool which takes advantage of these restrictions to bring the scheduling problem closer to feasibility. In addition, we describe an algorithm to reduce problem inputs given a partially-solved problem,thereby bringing the problem even closer to feasibility"

This abstract focuses on our high-level approach for scheduling imaging tasks across a constellation of satellite, which is subject to orbital and other practical constraints such as finding a feasible up-/down- link schedule. Our approach is inspired by combining insights from two existing approaches about the structure of these problems to create an efficient, new approach. We show that our approach stacks up favorably against two baselines–an optimal solver as well as a naive, greedy approach."

Delivering the mission’s Perseverance rover to Jezero Crater required adjusting the postlaunch trajectory to remove the launch injection bias and to target the atmospheric entry conditions, while also satisfying requirements on the propellant usage and non-nominal impact probability at Mars. The Mars 2020 maneuver design team achieved these goals by designing and executing three propulsive maneuvers in flight. The accurate on-board execution of those maneuvers delivered the spacecraft into the Martian atmosphere in a state that allowed for a successful entry, descent, and landing on the surface. This paper details the maneuver design process and describes the design and execution of the three in-flight propulsive maneuvers."

Among the persisting orbits are unstable resonant periodic or- bits. In this study, we first compute invariant tori in the planar concentric cir- cular restricted 4-body problem corresponding to exterior Jupiter-Europa and in- terior Jupiter-Ganymede PCRTBP resonant periodic orbits. Motivated by the 2:1 Laplace resonance between the orbits of Europa and Ganymede around Jupiter, we then use the computed tori to characterize relations between m:n Jupiter-Ganymede and m:2n Jupiter-Europa PCRTBP resonant orbits."

Previous implementations of MRPPO have relied on a predefined reference transfer to successfully train each policy. In this paper, an algorithmic modification labeled the ‘moving reference’, is introduced to autonomously construct these reference trajectories during training. With this modification, MRPPO is used to recover various low-thrust transfers between two periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon circular restricted three-body problem to solve a multi-objective optimization problem. These results are then compared with the solutions recovered via a gradient descent optimization scheme to validate the performance of MRPPO with the moving reference modification."

This development will advance lunar mission design and formulation for current and future communications architectures, and will aid in lunar surface mission planning and communications/navigation operations. Our effort can be described in three steps: (1) we parallelize a brute force algorithm, which computes elevation masks from laser altimetry data acquired by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s (LRO) Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA); (2) we investigate parallel I/O methods to store terrain mask information from step (1) into a parallel file system; and (3) we finally deliver data to the terrain coverage analysis tool."

The baseline spacecraft design is a hybrid of JPL’s deep-space heritage subsystems with commercial partner Maxar’s electric propulsion, power, and structure subsystems. The Psyche mission will feature the first use of Hall thrusters for a NASA mission, and the first use of Hall thrusters beyond cis-lunar space. This paper will provide an overview of the electric propulsion subsystem and details of the flight system implementation for the Psyche mission. The concept of operations is discussed including subsystem-level operations, the initial checkout after launch, and cruise and orbital operations. Command and control interfaces with the spacecraft and fault protection design are presented. Finally, the status of subsystem assembly and test is described."

The planner must ensure robustness to unknown phenomena and manage unpredictable variation in execution, all while operating in a capacity that maximizes its objective. Productivity in the face of these challenges re-quires an integrated approach to planning and execution that is capable of accomplishing goals, reacting to variation, and maximizing overall utility. We examine this problem in the context of a Europa Lander concept mission. We model the problem as a hierarchical task network, framing it as a utility maximization problem constrained on a depletable energy resource. We propose an uncertainty–sensitive deterministic planning framework that utilizes periodic replanning to better handle model uncertainty and variable execution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through simulations of a Europa Lander concept mission in which our algorithm out-performs several baseline approaches in both utility maximization and robustness"

A previous work found many low-energy landing trajectories to various moons in the solar system by studying the unstable manifolds of Lyapunov, vertical, and halo periodic orbits. A potential shortcoming of this approach is the lack of abort options for a landing mission. If anything goes wrong prior to landing, there may not be an solution if the spacecraft has already departed the periodic orbit. Similarly, a solution which could return to its initially planned landing site could also perform observation flybys prior to landing to ensure the safety of the site. In the current work, we discuss a new strategy for finding periodic orbits that tangentially intersect the surface of Europa and are themselves either stable or nearly-stable. These qualities may allow certain periodic orbits to act as their own abort solutions or to closely observe their landing sites prior to landing. 18 such periodic orbits that have been identified so far are presented here."

However, soil moisture and VOD are typically jointly estimated, where errors in the optimization approach can cause compensation between both variables and confound such studies. It is thus critical to quantify how satellite microwave measurement errors propagate into soil moisture and VOD. Such a study is especially important for VOD given limited investigations of whether VOD reflects in-situ plant physiology. Furthermore, despite new approaches that constrain (or regularize) VOD dynamics to reduce soil moisture errors, there is limited study of whether regularization reduces VOD errors without obscuring true vegetation temporal dynamics. Here, we find that, across the globe, VOD is less robust to measurement error (more difficult for optimization methods to find the true solution) than soil moisture in their joint estimation. However, a moderate degree of regularization (via time-constrained VOD) reduces errors in VOD to a greater degree than soil moisture and reduces spurious soil moisture-VOD coupling. Furthermore, despite constraining VOD time dynamics, regularized VOD variations on sub-weekly scales are both closer to simulated true VOD time series and have global VOD post-rainfall responses with reduced error signatures compared to VOD retrievals without regularization. Ultimately, we recommend moderately regularized VOD for use in large scale studies of soil-plant water relations because it suppresses noise and spurious soil moisture-VOD coupling without removing the physical signal."

This work provides a case study of how community input, neighborhood-level health surveys, and air quality monitoring can inform the understanding of asthma and air pollution.A partnership between residents, concerned citizens, scientists, and educators has been working for envi-ronmental health in a DC neighborhood located on a major roadway, next to concrete batch plants andclose to several construction projects. A 2016 Community Health and Safety Study by the DC Departmentof Health, Office of Health Equity, recognized this particular neighborhood as more vulnerable to healthimpacts from recent construction in the area, compared with the surrounding areas, due to lower averageincome and higher percentage of seniors and children. This work presents neighborhood health surveysand air quality monitoring data at a more granular, local level than available from DC governmentagencies.  The  health  surveys  documented  residents’  experiences  around  air  pollution,  asthma,and other health concerns. A key finding was evidence that asthma might be undercounted in thisneighborhood; among residents who did not indicate a diagnosis of asthma, many discussed havingsymptoms that could reflect asthma. Air quality monitoring (particulate matter [PM]) did not indicate thatfederal air quality standards have been violated. Real-time PM data, however,illustrated how current PMstandards, such as 1- and 24-hour averages, may fail to capture shorter duration high PM events that areconsistent with resident concerns."

The emission from the clouds extends to a height of≈4–5×104km at temperatures of ≈2–3 MK. These “hot clouds” are variable, but persist for many days and do not appear to connect directly to the active region streamers or other large-scale structures observed higher in the corona. We present an observational analysis of these diffuse structures to establish basic plasma parameters such as magnetic field strength, particle density, and temperature. The values ofβ, the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic field pressure, were found to be generally less than unity, though often approaching unity in the upper portions of the active region, where the hot clouds are located. The magnetic field may therefore only partially confine these regions and inhibit flare-like instabilities that could otherwise be driven by gradients of plasma pressure and current density."

This requires reaching the ocean below extremely cold through significant deep ice.  Jupiter’s moon, Europa, is such a challenging body, where it is estimated to have a 40 km thick ice shell. An approach for reaching the ocean has been conceived using a melting probe Cryobot concept that has been studied for a potential future mission. A lander is assumed to be the platform from which the Cryobot would be deployed. The ice penetrating vehicle concept consists of a cylindrical, narrow-body probe that encases a radioisotope heat/power source that would be used to do the penetration by melting through the icy crust. The baseline design of the probe includes a suite of science instruments to analyze the ice during descent and the liquid ocean underneath. For communication, a set of fiber optic wire as well as wireless RF in the very cold porous top layer is assumed, and then acoustic modules would be used for the communication in warmer denser ice over distance of 25 km between the modules. In addition to the acoustic communication modules, a sonar is part of the concept, for obstacle avoidance. The focus of this paper is on the use of elastic waves in the 1kHz range."

This paper proposes to extend the mechatronics course beyond traditional engineering topics, and to modernize the mechatronics instructions with complementary quantum engineering topics. With the recent rapid advances in quantum technologies such as quantum communications, sensing, computers, and algorithms, it is imperative to train the next generation of engineers and prepare them for their future careers in the ever-changing industry in such areas. Furthermore, due to such progress and advances in the fields associated with quantum mechanics, the integration of quantum technologies with classical mechanical systems will be inevitable both in terms of educational and technological standpoints in future. To address the educational needs of the future engineers in such areas of significant importance, quantum entanglement and quantum cryptography experiments, as two fundamental topics in quantum mechanics, are brought into the mechatronics course in an initiative that is reported in this paper. The integrated quantum and mechatronics topics also provides opportunities for open discussions on exploring the interface of quantum technologies and classical engineering systems, which can potentially push the engineering boundaries beyond classical possibilities by accessing the quantum advantages. An innovative online remote demonstration of such quantum experiments are developed and presented to the students. This course has been offered to undergraduate students once with successful results. The students were able to remotely access the experiments, perform the experiments and collect data. The successful result of such quantum experiments is also reflected in a course survey, presented in this paper, even though the quantum mechanics topics offered in this course are unfamiliar to engineering students and hence more challenging. The paper reports, and aims to promote, the integration of selected quantum technology topics with the mechatronics course for training engineering students in this rapidly growing area."

The mission will exploit synthetic aperture radar to map Earth’s surface every 12 days, persistently on ascending and descending portions of the orbit, over all land and ice-covered surfaces. The mission’s primary objectives will be to study Earth land and ice deformation, and ecosystems, in areas of common interest to the US and Indian science communities. This single observatory solution with an L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength) radar has a swath of over 240 km at fine resolution, using full polarimetry where needed. To achieve these unprecedented capabilities, both radars use a reflector-feed system, whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive (“SweepSAR”) capability at both L-band and S-band.  The L-band and S-band electronics and feed apertures, provided by NASA and ISRO respectively, share a common 12-m diameter deployable reflector/boom system, provided by NASA. These two radars, which can operate simultaneously, even with FPGA-based on-board digital beamforming and filtering to reduce data rates, produce prodigious amounts of data. Given the high data rates and ambitious coverage requirements, new technologies for high-rate Ka-band downlink complement these first-of-a-kind radar systems."

Recent work has addressed this requirement with new analytic tools and paradigms that allow integrated TEG cost-performance analysis and optimization. New work herein has identified the existence of optimized TE element design (i.e., TE element length) for minimizing TEG cost and provides design guidelines associated with critical thermal and electrical contact resistance effects and TE manufacturing sensitivities. Once optimum hot-side heat flux criteria are satisfied, this work highlights the tradeoffs between interface resistance effects and manufacturing cost effects in determining optimum-cost TE element lengths, and then quantifies the increase in optimum-cost TE lengths as manufacturing costs become more sensitive to TE element lengths. Optimized TE element design criteria and key non-dimensional design parameters (i.e., [𝐶′′′LTE/𝐶′′], [TE/con], [con/(TE,aveLTE)]) driving the design are presented and explained showing the interdependencies between manufacturing cost parameters and thermal and electrical interface impacts on integrated TE cost-performance analysis and design. Comprehensive TEG system cost-performance relationships clearly demonstrate the two parameters that most greatly impact the TEG system cost are heat exchanger costs ($/(W/K)) and TE hot side heat flux. Reducing heat exhanger cost from $1/(W/K) to $0.5/(W/K) can decrease TEG system cost by $2/W to $4/W depending on TE hot side heat fluxes from 4-10 W/cm2. The impact of TE hot side heat flux on TEG system cost is larger; reducing TE system cost by factors of 2-4 as TE hot side heat flux increases from 4 W/cm2 to high levels around 18 W/cm2. The levels of thermal contact resistance and electrical contact resistance required to even approach the critical TEG system cost level of $1/W are characterized by con = 1.0 x 10-10 -m2 and r = 0.1, respectively. This not only lowers TEG costs, but it also makes the TEG system costs less sensitive to TE manufacturing dependences on TE element length. New design paradigms and relationships create holistic, integrated TE performance-cost models that enhance understanding of crucial interrelationships between component costs, TE design parameters and material properties, heat exchanger design parameters, interfacial heat flux, and now thermal and electrical interface effects in minimizing TEG system costs."

Part I: Five Products Assessed via a Wavenumber–Frequency Decomposition,"As more global satellite-derived precipitation products become available, it is imperative to evaluate them more carefully for providing guidance as to how well precipitation space–time features are captured for use in hydrologic modeling, climate studies, and other applications. Here we propose a space–time Fourier spectral analysis and define a suite of metrics that evaluate the spatial organization of storm systems, the propagation speed and direction of precipitation features, and the space–time scales at which a satellite product reproduces the variability of a reference “ground-truth” product (“effective resolution”). We demonstrate how the methodology relates to our physical intuition using the case study of a storm system with rich space–time structure. We then evaluate five high-resolution multisatellite products (CMORPH, GSMaP, IMERG-Early, IMERG-Final, and PERSIANN-CCS) over a period of 2 years over the southeastern United States. All five satellite products show generally consistent space–time power spectral density when compared to a reference ground gauge–radar dataset (GV-MRMS), revealing agreement in terms of average morphology and dynamics of precipitation systems. However, a deficit of spectral power at wavelengths shorter than 200 km and periods shorter than 4 h reveals that all satellite products are excessively “smooth.” The products also show low levels of spectral coherence with the gauge–radar reference at these fine scales, revealing discrepancies in capturing the location and timing of precipitation features. From the space–time spectral coherence, the IMERG-Final product shows superior ability in resolving the space–time dynamics of precipitation down to 200-km and 4-h scales compared to the other products."

The MRN has admirably flight-demonstrated the benefits of a relay network and validated how international protocol standards may be used to ensure interoperability. However, principally designed for science missions, these orbiters addressed relay requirements as a secondary function, which introduced limitations to what can be achieved with the network. Next-decade missions are expected to have significantly greater communication needs than can be accommodated by the aging MRN. This paper reports the results of a broad study that evaluated the potential of a next-generation relay network, referencing the current MRN as a benchmark. A wide variety of orbital altitudes, surface latitudes, and mission scenarios were evaluated around a specific set of assumptions regarding the telecommunications payloads included. The study outlined how current day technologies could be applied to greatly enhance the data throughput to and from Mars on behalf of future science and reconnaissance missions. The instantiation of such a network would be enabling for a variety of missions and mission classes that have been heretofore unachievable, including both large and small orbiters, and landed vehicles representing new mission types (i.e. climbers, diggers, drones, etc.), and further argues that such a network would be instrumental in advancing human exploration interests at Mars."

Kinetic isotope effects, a subset of disequilibrium, are common in nature and have been assumed to be distinct from equilibrium and mass independent isotope effects based on underdeveloped criteria. Using basic physical principles, we provide needed mechanistic constraints on mass-dependent kinetic isotope effects for the triple oxygen isotope system. We find some kinetic isotope effects yield large isotopic variations, exceeding equilibrium, which could be mistaken for mass independent relationships. Meanwhile, other kinetic isotope effects are found to have triple oxygen isotope relationships that could be mistaken for equilibrium isotope effects. Comparison against prior case studies of thermal decomposition of calcite (CaCO3) and brucite (Mg(OH)2) further tests our results. Although oxygen is the focus here, our approach applies to any system with more than two isotopes."

moment for modern science, to say nothing of its impacts on isotope geochemistry. At the time,
oxygen was the international standard for atomic weight, as it had been for over twenty-five
years. However, chemists and physicists had grown fond of different definitions: physicists used
the weight of the 16O atom, while chemists used half the weight of atmospheric oxygen (O2) to
define the precise weight of 16 atomic mass units. While they usually avoided direct conflicts,
these contrasting definitions found an unexpected impasse in the near-infrared absorption

This so-called “high-energy tail” has recently been shown to be strong in the hard spectral state and has been interpreted as high-energy part of the emission from a compact jet. 

Aims. This result was, however, obtained from a data set largely dominated by hard state observations. In the soft state, only upper limits on the presence and hence the potential parameters of a hard tail could be derived. Using an extended data set we aim at obtaining better constraints on the properties of this spectral component in both states. Methods. We make use of data obtained from about 15 years of observations with the INTEGRAL satellite. The data set is separated into the different states and we analyse stacked state-resolved spectra obtained from both the gamma-ray Imager and the Spectrometer onboard.

Results. A  high-energy  component  is  detected  in  both  states,  confirming  its  earlier  detection  in  the  hard  state  and  its  suspected presence in the soft state as seen in a much smaller SPI data set. We first characterize the hard tail components in the two states through a model-independent, phenomenological analysis. We then apply physical models based on hybrid Comptonization (eqpair and belm). The spectra are well modeled in all cases, with a similar goodness of the fit. The spectral properties of the tails in the two states are, however, quite different. This might indicate that the emission originates from different media in the two cases. Our results are compatible with a compact jet origin in the hard state and hybrid Comptonization in the soft state."

For Lunar and Martian colonization, the ability to manufacture mechanical and structural components with local resources is essential. Ionic liquids (IL) are being studied at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to harvest elemental metals from meteorites and regolith oxides. In this investigation, the viability of casting ductile iron using ionic liquids sourced iron and nickel was explored given ductile iron’s range of applications and performance as an as-cast alloy. Ingots were produced using commercial elements to simulate the use of IL iron with carbon sourced from the by-products of a life support system currently tested at MSFC. Samples were cast and compared to commercial ductile iron with phase transformation diagrams,microstructures, and hardness. Results showed ionic liquids sourced elements are a viable source of elemental alloying materials for a range of ductile iron alloys."

protection system (TPS) and resulting material stiffness reduction was studied via a
comparison of finite element results from linear and iterative linear analyses. A dual-layer
continuous dry weave material with a low-density phenolic resin matrix has been developed
for use in extreme environments. Due to high stresses in the through-the-thickness direction,
microcracks may form in the matrix. The matrix does not have structural load transfer
requirements, and testing has shown that microcracked phenolic resin satisfies thermal
requirements. Microcracks in the matrix would result in a reduction of stiffness, which could
alter the structural performance. A study was conducted to determine if reduction in material
stiffness would change the load paths or structural margins. A linear finite element analysis
that did not account for microcracking and an iterative linear finite element analysis that
accounted for propagation microcracks were compared. Four subcases were analyzed with results indicating that the assumed propagation strength for the microcracking is the critical
parameter for determining the extent of microcracking. Phenolic microcracking does not
appear to have an adverse effect on the structural response and is not a critical failure for the
modeled TPS."

Many applicable lander and upperstage vehicle concepts utilize cryogenic H2 and O2 propellants.
This propellant selection enables appealing potential mission concepts wherein electricity is generated by operating a fuel cell on residual H2 and O2 propellants. This concept depends on the capability of the fuel cell to utilize dry, propellant-grade reactants with concentrations of up to 30 percent He present. This study consists of the evaluation of a 12-cell non-flow-through proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack of 50 sq. cm active area with passive water removal. This stack was supplied with three levels of reactant purity: >99.999, 99.1, and 70 mol%, with the remainder made up of He. The reactant humidity and flow-through rate were also assessed as performance factors, and the fuel stack repeatedly supported a load profile with current densities up to 500 mA/sq. cm (25 A). The fuel cell performed consistently over the course of testing, with cell voltages decreasing approximately 50 mV at the maximum current density when supplied with reactants with 30 percent He present."

The ability to make complex geometries that were impossible to create using conventional manufacturing methods has sparked interest from the aerospace community, including NASA. The use of AM components for crucial and human rated space missions necessitates a full characterization of the differences between AM and more conventional wrought and cast processes. For this study, sixteen different commercially available superalloy 718 powder feedstocks were obtained, built using laser powder bed fusion(L-PBF), and microstructurally and mechanically analyzed. These measurements revealed a wide range of build qualities and microstructures despite all powder lots falling within the 718chemical specification and being processed using the same prescribed build and heat treatment parameters. Statistical analysis found a strong correlation of the amount of carbon in the powder with the final grain size and strength of the heat-treated 718 part. Ultimately, this study highlights the need of a refined superalloy 718 chemical specification for powder lots to be used in AM."

Satellite precipitation estimates are based on geosynchronous infrared sensors on geostationary satellites, characterized by high sampling frequency, and polar-orbiting microwave sensors on low-Earth-orbiting satellites with less-frequent sampling. Assessing satellite product performance is fundamental to infer the reliability of such estimates and effectively use them in water resources management, extreme event characterization, disease control, or weather forecasting. Nevertheless, errors and uncertainties associated with satellite precipitation products are often masked due to temporal and spatial sampling, as well as bias-corrections against a reference dataset. Moreover, the verification of satellite precipitation products is easier over land areas, where rain gauges and ground radars are available as benchmark, but extremely limited over the oceans. Substantial work still remains to better quantify relative and absolute errors and uncertainties within satellite-based precipitation products over land and oceans."

Precipitation is a key component of the global energy and water cycle moving water, and its’ associated energy, through the Earth system at relatively fine spatial and temporal scales. At the societal level, precipitation provides fresh water and moderates our climate, but can also be destructive through storms, droughts and spreading diseases. Monitoring and measuring the distribution and quantities of precipitation, across the Earth’s surface is therefore crucial to physical and social applications, together with changes in precipitation over time. While conventional surface instruments provide a reasonably long record, these tend to be confined to well populated land surface areas: most ocean regions and sparsely populated regions have few measurements. Satellite-based precipitation products can provide global measurements, although the timespan of such products is limited and the data record is comprised of different instruments that operate over different periods of record. The challenge of any climate record is to provide a consistent product over the full period of record. Many satellite precipitation products incorporate ancillary data, such as surface gauge data or model data, which may limit their utility in the validation or verification of other climate data records.
This chapter provides a review of the importance of precipitation to the climate system, the basis of satellite precipitation retrievals, climate data records of satellite data for precipitation retrievals and the development of fundamental precipitation data records for climate applications."

We use combined microwave maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR5 and Planck in combination with the CMASS (mean redshifthzi¼0.55and host halo masshMviri¼3×1013M⊙) and LOWZ (hzi¼0.31,hMviri¼5×1013M⊙) galaxy catalogs from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS DR10 and DR12), to study the gas associated with these galaxy groups. Using individual reconstructed velocities, we perform a stacking analysis and reject the no-kSZ hypothes is at 6.5σ, the highest significance to date. This directly translates into a measurement of the electron number density profile, and thus of the gas density profile. Despite the limited signal to noise, the measurement shows at high significance that the gas density profile is more extended than the dark matter density profile, for any reasonable baryon abundance (formally>90σfor the cosmic baryon abundance). We simultaneously measure the tSZ signal, i.e., the electron thermal pressure profile of the same CMASS objects, and reject theno-tSZ hypothesis at10σ. We combine tSZ and kSZ measurements to estimate the electron temperature to20% precision in several aperture bins, and find it comparable to the virial temperature. In a companion paper, we analyze these measurements to constrain the gas thermodynamics and the properties of feedback inside galaxy groups. We present the corresponding LOWZ measurements in this paper, ruling out a null kSZ (tSZ)signal at 2.9ð13.9Þσ, and leave their interpretation to future work. This paper and the companion paper demonstrate that current CMB experiments can detect and resolve gas profiles in low mass halos and at high redshifts, which are the most sensitive to feedback in galaxy formation and the most difficult to measure any other way. They will be a crucial input to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, thus improving our understanding of galaxy formation. These precise gas profiles are already sufficient to reduce the main limiting theoretical systematic in galaxy-galaxy lensing: baryonic uncertainties. Future such measurements will thus unleash the statistical power of weak lensing from the Rubin, Euclid and Roman observatories. Our stacking software Thumb Stack is publicly available and directly applicable to future Simons Observatory andCMB-S4 data."

Detection of a new magnetic B-type star from follow-up spectropolarimetric observations of photometrically selected candidates,"In this paper, we present results from the spectropolarimetric follow-up of photometrically selected candidate magnetic B stars from the MOBSTER project. Out of four observed targets, one (HD 38170) is found to host a detectable surface magnetic field, with a maximum longitudinal field measurement of 105±14 G. This star is chemically peculiar and classified as a^2 CVn variable. Its detection validates the use of TESS to perform a photometric selection of magnetic candidates. Furthermore, upper limits on the strength of a putative dipolar magnetic field are derived for the remaining three stars, and we report the discovery of a previously unknown spectroscopic binary system, HD 25709. Finally, we use our non-detections as case studies to further inform the criteria to be used for the selection of a larger sample of stars to be followed up using high-resolution spectropolarimetry."

Typically, the STLE location is determined using wall static-pressure measurements, but there are often restrictions on the placement and overall number of the pressure transducers, reducing the viability and accuracy of such approaches. To address these issues, we introduce the adaptive pressure profile (APP) method for estimating the STLE location. This method does not require extensive prior characterization of the isolator or engine model. Instead, it uses real-time pressure measurements from a small number of transducers to adaptively learn the isolator pressure profile and subsequently uses this deduced profile to estimate the STLE location in a data-driven manner. The APP method works well in situations with sparse transducer placement. It produces accurate estimates when the STLE location is 1) not bounded by two or more transducers or 2) between two transducers that are several isolator duct heights apart. We demonstrate the efficacy of the APP method using simulations and experimental data from direct-connect isolator models. This validation shows that the APP method is accurate and robust for different flow regimes, transducer configurations, and model geometries."

We investigate how the moderate spin of a postmerger Kerr black hole immersed in a plasma with initially uniform density and uniform magnetic field affects potentially observable accretion rates and energy fluxes. Varying the initial specific internal energy of the plasma over two decades, we find very little change in steady-state mass accretion rate or Poynting luminosity, except at the lowest internal energies, where fluxes do not exhibit steady-state behavior during the simulation timescale. Fixing the internal energy and varying the initial fixed magnetic-field amplitude and orientation, we find that the steady-state Poynting luminosity depends strongly on the initial field angle with respect to the black hole spin axis, while the matter accretion rate is more stable until the field angle exceeds ∼45°. The protojet formed along the black hole spin axis conforms to a thin, elongated cylinder near the hole, while aligning with the asymptotic magnetic field at large distances."

Many symbolic major events have celebrated these developments,
e.g., in Venice, Italy, the 15th (2006) and 20th (2012) years of progress and more recently, in 2018, in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 25 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry. On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and
for hydrology. The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the ‘‘Green” Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments’ development and satellite missions’ evolutions are described in a fourth section. A fifth section covers the key observations that altimeters provide and their potential complements, from other Earth observation measurements to in situ data. Section 6 identifies the data and methods and provides some accuracy and resolution requirements for the wet tropospheric correction, the orbit and other geodetic requirements, the Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Mean Dynamic Topography, Calibration and Validation, data accuracy, data access and handling (including the DUACS system). Section 7 brings a transversal view on scales, integration, artificial intelligence, and capacity building (education and training).

From these, we find an orbital period of P= 76841.3(+1.3,−1.4) s (≈21.3 hours) and an eclipse duration of t(ec)= 4098(+17,−18) s (≈1.14 hours).We also find several absorption dips during the pre-eclipse phase. From the eclipse duration to orbital period ratio, the inclination of the binary orbit is constrained to i >70◦. The most likely range for the companion mass suggests that the inclination is likely to be closer to this value than 90◦. The eclipses are also consistent with earlier data, in which strong variability (‘flares’) and the long orbital period prevent clear detection of the period or eclipses. We also find that the bright flares occurred preferentially in the post-eclipse phase of the orbit, likely due to increased thickness at the disc-accretion stream interface preventing flares being visible during the pre-eclipse phase. This supports the notion that variable obscuration is responsible for the unusually strong variability in Swift J1858.6–0814."

Unfortunately, this is difficult for current rigid designs as a crash of all but the smallest aircraft  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  its  target.   As  an  alternative,  this  pa-per  explores  using  a  soft  tensegrity  structure  (interconnected  cables  and  rods)  as a  lightweight,  robust  chassis  for  a  UAS  and  analyze  its  ability  to  achieve  stable, controllable flight and mitigate damage during a collision.  Tensegrity structures are three dimensional geometric constructions which are able to undergo severe deformations without permanent damage, and can immediately return to their original shape.  Experiments and analysis are performed using a simple physics simulation environment, allowing for rapid design iteration and thorough exploration of system behavior.  We test multiple configurations of the vehicle to understand impacts of changing various physical characteristics, and take limitations such as modern propeller thrust coefficients and motor speeds into account to ensure our results are inline with those of a real world vehicle.  We ultimately find that such a vehicle has considerable real world potential, and that a physical prototype could theoretically be constructed and flown with current technology."

The thruster demonstrated stable operation in all seven available channel combinations at discharge voltages from 300 V to 500 V and three different current densities. The resulting test matrix contained forty-six unique conditions ranging from 5 to 102 kW total power and 16 to 247 A discharge current. At each operating condition, thrust and telemetry was measured, and from these measurements specific impulse and efficiency were calculated. All seven channel combinations showed similar performance at a given discharge voltage and current density. The largest thrust recorded was 5.4 N ± 0.1 N at 99 kW, 400 V discharge voltage. Total efficiency and specific impulse ranged from 0.54 to 0.67 ± 0.03 and 1800 seconds to 2650 seconds ± 60 seconds, respectively. It was found that the thrust of the three channels firing together was not larger than the sum of each channel firing individually. Discharge current oscillations were also characterized with peak-to-peak and root-mean-square values and with high-speed camera analysis, which provide insight into how the discharge channels oscillate, and how those oscillations are affected by the presence of other operating channels. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of operation beyond 100 kW, as well as the general viability of NHT technology for future mission applications."

Recent studies of the solar wind sunward of 0.25 AU reveal that it contains quiescent regions, with low-amplitude plasma and magnetic field fluctuations, and a magnetic field direction similar to the Parker spiral. The quiescent regions are thought to have a more direct magnetic connection to the solar corona than other types of solar wind, suggesting that waves or instabilities in the quiescent regions are indicative of the early evolution of the solar wind as it escapes the corona. The quiescent solar wind regions are highly unstable to the formation of plasma waves near the electron cyclotron frequency (fce).

Aims. We examine high time resolution observations of these waves in an effort to understand their impact on electron distribution functions of the quiescent near-Sun solar wind.

Methods. High time resolution waveform captures of near-fce waves were examined to determine variations of their amplitude and frequency in time as well as their polarization properties.

Results. We demonstrate that the near-fce wave intervals contain several distinct wave types, including electron Bernstein waves and extremely narrowband waves that are highly sensitive to the ambient magnetic field orientation. Using the properties of these waves, we suggest possible plasma wave mode classifications and possible instabilities that generate these waves. The results of this analysis indicate that these waves may modify the cold core of the electron distribution functions in the quiescent near-Sun solar wind."

The long-term stability of thermal emissive bands (TEBs) of Aqua MODIS was monitoredthrough inter-comparisons with measurements by hyperspectral or multi-spectral infraredsensors or through vicarious monitoring over cold targets such as Dome-C and deep convectiveclouds. The radiative transfer modeling (RTM)-based simulation models are developed to per-form the long-term monitoring of the stability of Aqua MODIS TEBs. Long-term EuropeanCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global atmospheric reanalysis data are used asinputs to the RTM simulation. By confining ocean in low to middle latitudes as the area ofinterest, the long-term stabilities of Aqua MODIS TEBs are monitored through observationminus background (O-B) brightness temperature (BT) bias between MODIS measurements andsimulations from the RTM. In general, the RTM-based O-B analysis shows that the long-termstability of Aqua MODIS TEBs are maintained well. It is shown that Aqua MODIS surfacebands are all radiometrically stable with yearly BT bias drifts <0.005 K∕yearfor B20, B22,and B23 and∼0.01 K∕yearfor B31 and B32. The carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption channelsof Aqua MODIS, e.g., B33 to B36, are stable with a BT bias drift <0.005 K∕year. It is also foundthat after accounting for the long-term growth of greenhouse gasN2O, the O-B bias trends forB24 and B25 are quite stable with yearly BT bias drifts around 0.0002 and0.0055 K∕year,respectively. The stabilities of the moisture-sensitive channels B27 to B29 and the ozone channelB30 of Aqua MODIS are also evaluated and the remnant small variations in the O-B bias trend-ing of these channels are further discussed. The RTM-based inter-comparison of MODIS TEBmeasurements with global atmospheric and climate re-analysis data provides validation of thelong-term radiometric stability of Aqua MODIS TEBs. The analysis in this paper also demon-strates that the comparison of well-calibrated MODIS TEB measurements with RTM simulationhelps quantify the long-term impacts of global greenhouse gas concentration growth on the BTdecreases in the MODIS greenhouse gas-sensitive channels."

One metric in particular, the propeller pitching moment, has been observed to be important to VTOL aircraft stability and control in the past. Propellers at angles of attack could not be accurately modeled in generations past due to a lack of computational power, but even with advances in computer technology, modern designers seem to possess insufficient knowledge in this area. In this dissertation, we study the physics behind propeller pitching moment in the context of an isolated propeller and a propeller upstream of a wing. An unsteady 3D vortex lattice method is developed specifically to model propellers at angles of attack and is validated by comparing to high-fidelity CFD analyses. We then use the model to isolate velocity influences to show that the propeller pitching moment is largely caused by two effects: a skewed wake and the presence of wing circulation. Generated maps of propeller pitching moment over a range of operational parameters corresponding to VTOL transition show that the low flight speeds and high angles of attack encountered during transition lead to significant magnitudes of propeller pitching moment that would be difficult to trim using passive methods. Also, derivation of a generalizable metric of significance shows that the peak contribution of propeller pitching moment to aircraft stability is comparable to a longitudinal displacement of the center of gravity by several percent of the wing chord. Finally, we give a concluding discussion on the impact of propeller pitching moment on VTOL aircraft design."

Considerations for extending the application of gas path analysis techniques to Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) systems is also discussed, and simulated results from their application to an EAP concept comprised of turbomachinery and electrical system hardware is provided. Results are provided comparing the parameter estimation accuracy offered by taking a whole-system approach towards the problem setup versus that offered by analyzing each subsystem individually. For the latter, the importance of having accurate direct or inferred measurements of external mechanical torque loads placed upon turbomachinery shafts is emphasized."

A fourth-order spatially-accurate flow solver is employed to perform the simulation, using 10.2 billion grid points for a Reynolds number of 170000 based on the bump height. The key findings from the simulation are reported in the acceleration and deceleration flow regions associated with the bump shape. Significant anisotropy in the normal Reynolds stresses, along both the wall-normal and streamwise directions, is observed within the acceleration region. The ratio between the Reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy in that region also experiences significant deviations from the norms of a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer. The chosen Reynolds number generates strong flow separation in the adverse pressure gradient region, which is in contrast with a previous simulation at half the Reynolds number that only indicated incipient separation. An internal layer generated in the acceleration region evolves into a free shear layer that develops in the deceleration region and separates. Proper modeling of this inner layer appears crucial to predict the flow separation. Surface curvature effects on the attached flow development are also discussed."

NASA faces diverse and relatively unique challenges and opportunities as the leading U.S. agency for aeronautics development, cutting-edge scientific discovery, and human space exploration. To address these challenges and leverage opportunities, NASA uses foresight to strategically plan technology development across four mission directorates: Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, Space Technology Mission Directorate, Science Mission Directorate, and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. The mission directorates leverage a broad community of experts and partners to incorporate technology foresight into mission and program planning. Through this process NASA realizes tangible benefits to the agency’s science, technology, and exploration programs. 

As an independent office, NASA’s Office of the Chief Technologist (OCT) serves as a trusted authority to inform technology strategy and advocacy at the agency, enabling future missions and advancing U.S. economic competitiveness. Specifically, OCT coordinates and uses inputs from abroad community of experts, both internal and external to NASA, to inform decision making for technology plans, investments, and partnerships. OCT develops the NASA Technology Taxonomy to standardize communication across the agency’s diverse technology portfolio and the related Strategic Technology Investment Plan that integrates priorities and informs technology investment. Through these efforts, OCT has refined elements of foresight-informed strategic planning that may be applicable to other technology-driven industries where foresight is essential for resilience.

This chapter describes the processes of foresight for technology development at NASA and provides insight into the value the agency derives from these processes. The chapter further describes the role of OCT as an independent advisory office that supports NASA’s efforts to capitalize on foresight and strategic technology planning. We present these examples with consideration for how organizations in defense, security, and other technology-driven industries can operationalize foresight in their own strategic technology development."

The goal of this study was to determine the rate of hydroxyl formation and their thermal stability by monitoring changes in the SiOH (hydroxyl) stretching band near 3 μm using diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFTS). A 2 keV H2+ ion beam was used to simulate proton implantation on 78421 and on a crushed fused silica sample. We find that the OH band does not change unless the samples have been annealed in vacuum prior to irradiation. Qualitatively, the OH bands for the fused silica and 78421 are very different. The OH band for fused silica is centered at 2.74 μm and is relatively sharp ranging from 2.67 - 3.1 μm at full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), while the OH band for 78421 is centered at 3.0 μm and ranges from 2.74 - 3.37 μm at FWHM. The increase in wavelength and broadened nature of the OH band in 78421 may be associated with the OH’s proximity to surface defects and/or lattice vacancies. The lack of the H2O bending mode at 6.1 μm indicates that any adsorbed terrestrial H2O is below our detection limit, and therefore the H2O stretching mode at 2.9 μm is not significantly contributing to the broad 3 μm OH band and implies that proton implantation by itself does not lead to water formation. To simulate the maximum dayside temperature on the lunar surface, the lunar sample was heated after proton irradiation. The proton induced OH concentration was reduced by as much as 25% after heating to 400 K (127 °C)."

solar bands (RSB) covering a wavelength range from 400 to 2200 nm. Radiance is calculated from processing
raw signals with background, temperature, and electronic contamination corrected. Measured gain is calibrated
with a fully Sunlit solar diffuser (SD) at a stable radiance level, considering a slowly changing SD reflectance
degradation. These measurements provide time-dependent gain adjustment factors, and the calibration assumes
a linear response for each band and detector. Hence, an analysis of the dependence on different radiance levels
is warranted. The MODIS design has no mechanism for varying radiance levels, except for an attenuator screen.
However, it has been in static configuration for Terra since mid-2003. An external source of radiance attenuation
can be utilized during solar eclipse events, while maintaining high stability and accuracy of solar calibration
standards. Due to its long mission lifetime, Terra has seen several Sun-Moon near-conjunction events when it
coincides with the orbit path where the SD is directly illuminated. As of August 2020, we have identified 7 viable
partial solar eclipses in the Terra mission data. We will discuss several results of our study, including comparison
of measured SD signal to predicted radiance reduction based on a solar disk radiance model; nominal and outlier
behavior as a function of bands, detectors, and mirror-sides; and comparison with other data sets. Our main

As this interest in data science grows, so too does interest in tools and programs that facilitating such operations. This paper presents EnDEVR, the Environment for Data Engineering in Virtual Reality, a user-extensible system that allows for the execution of custom data science functions. We describe the user-centered design process for the EnDEVR system, based on the needs of subject matter experts within the aerospace and aviation industries. Fundamental to this design is a method for users to integrate their existing analysis code (that may leverage third-party vendors) as usable objects in the virtual environment; this allows organizations to operate without the price tag and lifetime obligations associated with commercial data science toolkits, a concept known as “vendor lock-in”. We then present our system design with iterative implementations, and conclude with lessons learned. The presented work may provide insight into future user-centered design processes for VR applications, particularly for digital transformation stakeholders to circumvent vendor lock-in."

Here, we compare the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), poleward ocean heat transport and sea surface warming in the Atlantic simulated with these models. In PlioMIP2, all models simulate an intensified mid-Pliocene AMOC. However, there is no consistent response in the simulated Atlantic ocean heat transport nor in the depth of the Atlantic overturning cell. The models show a large spread in the simulated AMOC maximum, the Atlantic ocean heat transport and the surface warming in the North Atlantic. Although a few models simulate a surface warming of ~8–12°C in the North Atlantic, similar to the reconstruction from Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) version 4, most models appear to underestimate this warming. The large model spread and model–data discrepancies in the PlioMIP2 ensemble do not support the hypothesis that an intensification of the AMOC, together with an increase in northward ocean heat transport, is the dominant mechanism for the mid-Pliocene warm climate over the North Atlantic."

Here, we develop, validate, and demonstrate stretched grids in the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry model in its high-performance implementation (GCHP). These multiscale grids are specified at runtime by four parameters that offer users nimble control of the region that is refined and the resolution of the refinement. We validate the stretched-grid simulation versus global cubed-sphere simulations. We demonstrate the operation and flexibility of stretched-grid simulations with two case studies that compare simulated tropospheric NO2column densities from stretched-grid and cubed-sphere simulations to retrieved column densities from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). The first case study uses a stretched grid with a broad refinement covering the contiguous US to produces imulated columns that perform similarly to a C180 (∼50 km) cubed-sphere simulation at less than one-ninth the computational expense. The second case study experiments with a large stretch-factor for a global stretched-grid simulation with a highly localized refinement with∼10 km resolution for California. We find that the refinement improves spatial agreement with TROPOMI columns compared to a C90 cubed-sphere simulation of comparable computational demands. Overall we find that stretched grids in GEOS-Chem are a practical tool for fine resolution regional- or continental-scale simulations of atmospheric chemistry. Stretched grids are available in GEOS-Chem version 13.0.0"

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm from MODIS (Terra and Aqua Collections 6 and 6.1) and VIIRS Deep Blue (DB) and MODIS (Terra and Aqua) Multi‐Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) retrievals are evaluated against ground‐based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations. We find a significant improvement in correlation with AERONET and other metrics in the latest DB AOD (MODIS C6.1 r^2=0.75, VIIRS r^2=0.79) compared to MODIS C6 (r2=0.62). In general, MAIAC (r^2=0.84) and DB (MODIS C6.1 and VIIRS) present similar statistical evaluation metrics for the western U.S. and are useful tools to characterize aerosol loading associated with wildfire smoke. We also evaluate three novel NASA MODIS plume injection height (PIH) products, one from MAIAC and two from the Aerosol Single scattering albedo and layer Height Estimation (ASHE) (MODIS and VIIRS) algorithm. Both Terra and Aqua MAIAC PIHs statistically agree with ground‐based and satellite lidar observations near the fire source, as do ASHE, although the latter is sensitive to assumptions about aerosol absorption properties. We introduce a first‐order approximation Smoke Height Boundary Layer Ratio (SHBLR) to qualitatively distinguish between aerosol pollution within the planetary boundary layer and the free troposphere. We summarize the scope, limitations, and suggestions for scientific applications of surface level aerosol concentrations specific to wildfire emissions and smoke plumes using these novel NASA MODIS and VIIRS aerosol products."

We test this hypothesis using radiometric and hydrologic analysis of those radar data. The dielectric loss between the reflection from the top of the basal layer and subglacial reflection and their reflectivity difference represent dual constraints upon the complex permittivity of the basal material. Either ice-cemented debris or fractured, well-drained bedrock explain the basal layer's radiometric properties. The subglacial reflector's geometry is parallel to isopotential hydraulic head contours, located 7.5–15.3 m below the interface, and 11 ± 7 dB brighter than the ice–basal layer reflection. We conclude that this subglacial reflection is a groundwater table and that its detection was enabled by the wide bandwidth of the radar system and unusual geologic setting, suggesting a path for future direct radar detection of subglacial groundwater elsewhere."

Here, we review OIB’s goals, instruments, campaigns, key scientific results, and implications for future investigations of the cryosphere. OIB’s primary goal was to use airborne laser altimetry to bridge the gap in fine-resolution elevation measurements of ice from space between the conclusion of NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat; 2003–2009) and its follow-on, ICESat-2 (launched 2018). Additional scientific requirements were intended to contextualize observed elevation changes using a multisensor suite of radar sounders, gravimeters, magnetometers, and cameras. Using 15 different aircraft, OIB conducted 968 science flights, of which 42% were repeat surveys of land ice, 42% were surveys of previously unmapped terrain across the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, Arctic ice caps, and Alaskan glaciers, and 16% were surveys of sea ice. The combination of an expansive instrument suite and breadth of surveys enabled numerous fundamental advances in our understanding of the Earth’s cryosphere. For land ice, OIB dramatically improved knowledge of interannual outlet-glacier variability, ice-sheet, and outlet-glacier thicknesses, snowfall rates on ice sheets, fjord and sub-ice-shelf bathymetry, and ice-sheet hydrology. Unanticipated discoveries included a reliable method for constraining the thickness within difficult-to-sound incised troughs beneath ice sheets, the extent of the firn aquifer within the Greenland Ice Sheet, the vulnerability of many Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers to ocean-driven melting at their grounding zones, and the dominance of surface-melt-driven mass loss of Alaskan glaciers. For sea ice, OIB significantly advanced our understanding of spatiotemporal variability in sea ice freeboard and its snow cover, especially through combined analysis of fine-resolution altimetry, visible imagery, and snow radar measurements of the overlying snow thickness. Such analyses led to the unanticipated discovery of an interdecadal decrease in snow thickness on Arctic sea ice and numerous opportunities to validate sea ice freeboards from satellite radar altimetry. While many of its data sets have yet to be fully explored, OIB’s scientific legacy has already demonstrated the value of sustained investment in reliable airborne platforms, airborne instrument development, interagency and international collaboration, and open and rapid data access to advance our understanding of Earth’s remote polar regions and their role in the Earth system."

Excess heat can cause increased heat-related morbidity, mortality, and energy costs. Vulnerability to heat-related illnesses is oftentimes correlated to demographics, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health conditions. The City of San Diego, California boasts 1.4 million residents and, like many other major cities, has experienced increases in heat-related hospitalizations and mortality. The burden of urban heat is also not equal amongst communities; areas with lower income and communities of color bear a disproportionate burden. In partnership with the City of San Diego, and American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) Thriving Earth Exchange, the DEVELOP team used Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), and ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) imagery to identify areas of highest heat based on land surface temperature from 2015-2020. Our analyses showed that health demographics such as obesity and cardiovascular health were the strongest indicators for heat vulnerability. In addition, various inputs (land use/land cover, tree canopy, and building intensity derived from the City of San Diego data along with albedo from Landsat 8) were used in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) urban cooling model to investigate changes in cooling rates in current and future scenarios for the city. The model results showed that cooling is expected to occur due to a 5% increase in tree canopy. The City of San Diego can use these results to inform the development of the Climate Resilient San Diego plan and prioritize at-risk communities for cooling interventions."

To determine the impact of dust aerosol on HIS radiance assimilation, we use a modified radiance assimilation system employing a one-dimensional variational assimilation system (1DVAR) developed under the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Numerical Weather Prediction–Satellite Application Facility (NWP-SAF) project, which uses the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV). Dust aerosol impacts on analyzed temperature and moisture fields are quantified using synthetic HIS observations from rawinsonde, Micropulse Lidar Network (MPLNET), and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). Specifically, a unit dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) contamination at 550 nm can introduce larger than 2.4 and 8.6 K peak biases in analyzed temperature and dewpoint, respectively, over our test domain. We hypothesize that aerosol observations, or even possibly forecasts from aerosol predication models, may be used operationally to mitigate dust induced temperature and moisture analysis biases through forward radiative transfer modeling."

However, assurance technologies need to be integrated into the design process in order to guarantee safe behavior, thereby enabling UAS operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). In this paper, formal methods are integrated with learning-enabled systems representations. The generation and representation of knowledge are captured via monadic second-order logic rules in the cognitive architecture Soar. These rules are translated into timed automata, and a proof of correctness for the translation is provided so that safety and liveness properties can be checked in the formal verification environment Uppaal. This approach is agnostic to the learning mechanism used to generate the learned rules (e.g., chunking, etc.). An example of a fault-tolerant, learning-enabled UAS deciding which of four contingency procedures to execute under a lost link scenario while overflying an urban area is used to illustrate the approach."

Owing to the steep increase of the CMB radiation energy density, IC/CMB is supposed to become progressively more important with respect to radio synchrotron cooling as the redshift increases. For typical energies at play, this process will up-scatter the CMB photons into the X-ray band, and is thus expected to yield a redshift-dependent, concurrent X-ray brightening and radio dimming of the jet-powered structures. Here, we show how a conclusive proof of this effect hinges on high-resolution imaging data in which the extended lobes can be distinguished from the compact hotspots where synchrotron self-Compton dominates the X-ray emission regardless of redshift. We analyse Chandra and Very Large Array data of 11 radio galaxies between 1.3 ≲ z8 ≲ 4.3⁠, and demonstrate that the emission from their lobes is fully consistent with the expectations from IC/CMB in equipartition. Once the dependence on size and radio luminosity are properly accounted for, the measured lobe X-ray luminosities bear the characteristic ∝(1 + z)4 proportionality expected of a CMB seed radiation field. Whereas this effect can effectively quench the (rest-frame) GHz radio emission from z ≳ 3 radio galaxies below ≲ 1 mJy, IC/CMB alone cannot be responsible for a deficit in high-z, radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) if – as we argue – such AGNs typically have bright, compact hotspots."

Here, we report on the successful recovery of meteorites. Additional astrometric data refine the approach orbit and define the spin period and shape of the asteroid. Video observations of the fireball constrain the asteroid’s position in its orbit and were used to triangulate the location of the fireball’s main flare over the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. Twenty-three meteorites were recovered. A consortium study of eight of these classifies Motopi Pan as an HED polymict breccia derived from howardite, cumulate and basaltic eucrite, and diogenite lithologies. Before impact, 2018 LA was a solid rock of ~156 cm diameter with high bulk density ~2.85 g cm(exp -3), a relatively low albedo p(sub v) ~0.25, no significant opposition effect on the asteroid brightness, and an impact kinetic energy of ~0.2 kt. The orbit of 2018 LA is consistent with an origin at Vesta (or its Vestoids) and delivery into an Earth-impacting orbit via the m6 resonance. The impact that ejected 2018 LA in an orbit toward Earth occurred 22.8 ± 3.8 Ma ago. Zircons record a concordant U-Pb age of 4563 ± 11 Ma and a consistent 207Pb/206Pb age of 4563 ± 6 Ma. A much younger Pb-Pb phosphate resetting age of 4234 ± 41 Ma was found. From this impact chronology, we discuss what is the possible source crater of Motopi Pan and the age of Vesta’s Veneneia impact basin."

An occulter, acting as a natural coronagraph, impacts observations from our perspective, but not from most other directions. Other sight-lines are visible to us through studies of the Homunculus reflection nebula. The coronagraph appears to be vanishing, decreasing the extinction towards the central star, and causing the star's secular brightening. In contrast, the Homunculus remains at an almost constant brightness. The coronagraph primarily suppresses the stellar continuum, to a lesser extent the wind lines, and not the circumstellar emission lines. This explains why the absolute values of equivalent widths (EWs) of the emission lines in our direct view are larger than those seen in reflected by the Homunculus, why the direct view absolute EWs are decreasing with time, and why lower-excitation spectral wind lines formed at larger radii (e.g Fe ii 4585A) decrease in intensity at a faster pace than higher excitation lines that form closer to the star (e.g. Hdelta). Our main result is that the star, despite its 10-fold brightening over two decades, is relatively stable. A vanishing coronagraph that can explain both the large flux evolution and the much weaker spectral evolution. This is contrary to suggestions that the long-term variability is intrinsic to the primary star that is still recovering from the Great Eruption with a decreasing mass-loss rate and a polar wind that is evolving at a slower pace than at the equator."

This assessment was conducted following the installation of the new DRWP systems at the Eastern Range. DRWP profiles were compared to Automated Meteorological Profiling System balloons launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Launching balloons from the DRWP site was discussed, but was determined to be unfeasible. Therefore, these results include errors due to the spatial separation of winds. Mean wind component deltas generally ranged between -1.4-2.0 m/s between the balloons and DRWP systems. Data availability at discrete altitudes ranged from 7% to 98% with the least amount of available profiles being in the upper altitude ranges between 4000 m and 5000 m as well as below 300 m. The effective vertical resolution was not able to be estimated in this study, likely due to the relatively small dataset.

The combination of the field-particle correlation technique with the high fidelity representation of the particle distribution function provided by a direct discretization of the Vlasov equation allows us to ascertain the details of the exchange of energy between the electromagnetic fields and the particles in phase space. We identify the velocity-space signatures of shock-drift acceleration of the ions and adiabatic heating of the electrons due to the perpendicular collisionless shock by constructing a simplified model with the minimum ingredients necessary to produce the observed energization signatures in the self-consistent Vlasov-Maxwell simulation. We are thus able to completely characterize the energy transfer in the perpendicular collisionless shock considered here and provide predictions for the application of the field-particle correlation technique to spacecraft measurements of collisionless shocks."

As part of the final in-flight calibration, we determined that the best calibration method removes out-of-band IR signal leakage prior to radiometric calibration and updated the calibration coefficients accordingly.

Industrialization over the past few decades has resulted in severe aerosol pollution in India. Understanding monsoonal sensitivity to aerosol emissions in general circulation models (GCMs) could improve predictability of observed future precipitation changes. The aims here are (1) to assess the role of aerosols in India's monsoon precipitation and (2) to determine the roles of local and regional emissions. For (1), we study the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project experiments. We find that the precipitation response to changes in black carbon is highly uncertain with a large intermodel spread due in part to model differences in simulating changes in cloud vertical profiles. Effects from sulfate are clearer; increased sulfate reduces Indian precipitation, a consistency through all of the models studied here. For (2), we study bespoke simulations, with reduced Chinese and/or Indian emissions in three GCMs. A significant increase in precipitation (up to ∼20 %) is found only when both countries' sulfur emissions are regulated, which has been driven in large part by dynamic shifts in the location of convective regions in India. These changes have the potential to restore a portion of the precipitation losses induced by sulfate forcing over the last few decades."

We advocate RAM technology investment as complementary to and an accelerator for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and other initiatives that aspire to transform the airspace. Through targeted advanced technology investments, such as aircraft automation, enhanced operational models, more efficient aircraft and propulsion systems, and expanded airport renewable energy generation, many of which are already underway, RAM will increase the safety, accessibility, and affordability of regional travel while building on the extensive and underutilized federal, state, and local investment in our nation’s local airports."

The resulting CWP estimates are primarily determined by the optical depth input, although reflectivity measurements contribute ∼10 %–50 % of the uncertainty due to attenuation through the profile. Uncertainties in CWP estimates across all conditions are 25 % to 35 %, while RWP uncertainty estimates frequently exceed 100 %.

Two-thirds of all radar-detected clouds observed during the ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) campaign that took place from 2016–2018 over the southeast Atlantic Ocean have CWP between 41 and 168 g/sq. m and almost all CWPs (99 %) between 6 to 445 g/sq. m. RWP, by contrast, typically makes up a much smaller fraction of total liquid water path (LWP), with more than 70 % of raining clouds having less than 10 g/sq. m of rainwater. In heavier warm rain (i.e., rain rate exceeding 40 mm/h or 1000 mm/d), however, RWP is observed to exceed 2500 g/sq. m. CWP (RWP) is found to be approximately 30 g/sq. m (7 g/sq. m) larger in unstable environments compared to stable environments. Surface precipitation is also more than twice as likely in unstable environments. Comparisons against in situ cloud microphysical probe data spanning the range of thermodynamic stability and meteorological conditions encountered across the southeast Atlantic basin demonstrate that the combined APR-3 and RSP dataset enable a robust joint cloud–precipitation retrieval algorithm to support future ORACLES precipitation susceptibility and cloud–aerosol–precipitation interaction studies."

data gaps). Our results indicate that calibration factors for daily values can be used with confidence to combine data sets from different stations. However, for some applications which require the location of the sunspot groups the same correction factors should not be used. We estimate the irradiance deficit due to sunspot through the Photometric Sunspot Index and compare the output from similar data sets to quantify the effect of missing groups. We find differences as high as 150 ppm during the maximum of solar cycle. The effect increases for sunspot groups near the center of the disk accounting for about 80% of the observed differences."

Today, spaceflight missions are almost universally required to carry the entire amount of fuel required for the mission, for the entire duration of the mission, from the point of launch. This is the rough equivalent of making a drive from Ohio to California, requiring the traveler to bring along the total sum of gasoline required for the entire trip, without being able to ‘fill-up’ anywhere along the route. Obviously, this framework of travel greatly encumbers the breadth, scope, and efficiency of potential journeys. Cryogenic fuel/propellant depots have not been implemented because many technical, operational, and engineering challenges still exist. These must be overcome prior to the placement of usable on-orbit propellant depots. This thesis investigates three specific engineering challenges related to on-orbit propellant depots, and presents the current state, technological challenges, and ultimate benefits of on-orbit cryogenic refueling."

Here, we present analysis of 21 months of continuous aerosol size distribution measurements at a background remote site in the western Himalaya and provide observational evidence that newly formed particles grow to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)‐active sizes (i.e., >20–100 nm in diameter). Out of total 55 NPF events, 38 (66%) events occurred in the pre‐monsoon season (March–May). NPF events were classified into those with and without pollution influence as polluted and cleaner, respectively, using black carbon data. The analysis of air mass age, based on the ratio of number concentration of Aitken to accumulation mode aerosols, indicated that NPF occurred in the relatively cleaner air masses reaching to the site. The median formation rate of 10 nm particles and particle growth rates for cleaner events were three‐fold and two‐fold, respectively, higher than polluted events. We present the first estimates of the survival probability of newly formed particles to 50 and 100 nm size, which was not attempted in an Indian environment previously. The survival probability to 50 nm particles ranged from 44% to 98%, with a mean and standard deviation of 82 ± 18%. On average, ∼60% of the particles surviving to 50 nm survived to 100 nm, making the overall survival probability of 100 nm to 53 ± 31%. This indicates that the probability of nucleated particles growing to CCN‐active sizes under a large source of condensing vapor (transported from nearby lower‐altitude regions) and low pre‐existing particle concentrations (background mountain site) is high compared to the previous studies. These findings highlight the importance of the efficiency of nucleation events for producing CCN, which is a critical basis of aerosol indirect effects."

Recent devastating weather events have motivated regional organizations to dedicate efforts to drought and flood monitoring and early warning systems. The DEVELOP team partnered with the following organizations: Montana Climate Office, NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) Missouri Basin River Forecast Center, NOAA Regional Climate Services of the Central Region, NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory, and the US Army Corps of Engineers' Missouri River Basin Water Management Division. The team collaborated with the partners in their efforts to monitor flood and drought by enhancing a composite moisture index (CMI) for the Missouri River Basin. The CMI leverages NASA Earth observations to derive snow cover data from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) mission and snow water equivalent and snowdepth datasets from the NOAA NWS National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center’s Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS). Building upon this framework, the team added groundwater storage data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On missions, soil moisture data from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and United States Geological Survey in situ streamflow data to the CMI. To test the tool’s validity, the team compared the CMI results to historically extreme dry and extreme wet years, March 2017 and March 2019, respectively. The CMI accurately reflects both 2017 and 2019 climate conditions in the Missouri River Basin. The refined CMI enhances the understanding of antecedent soil moisture conditions and improves flood and drought forecasting in the Missouri River Basin before the growing season."

Any non-linear behavior in the system response can contribute to errors in NASA’s Level 1B MODIS reflectance and radiance products, which are used in a wide variety of Earth science applications. While most RSB detectors continue to have very linear behavior even after more than 18 years of operation, we present evidence that the detectors in Aqua MODIS bands 1 (645 nm) and 2 (858 nm) have deviations from gain linearity that change over the mission by up to 3%. We show a clear divergence between gain measurements made with the on-board solar diffuser (SD) at two different radiance levels, achieved by collecting data both with and without an attenuation screen. Radiance trends from lunar calibrations and typical desert and ocean scenes are also compared. We present a simple method to characterize the response non-linearity using a quadratic function by combining the results of the two sets of SD calibrations. Applying this quadratic calibration algorithm to the desert and lunar data results in improved agreement in their long-term radiance trends. A clear understanding of the magnitude of the gain non-linearity could be useful to help improve the quality of numerous MODIS science products, including the land imaging applications that rely heavily on these bands."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the spectral formation in the neutron star atmosphere at low M and to conduct a parameter study of physical properties of the emitting region. We obtain the structure of the static atmosphere, assuming that Coulomb collisions are the dominant deceleration process. The upper part of the atmosphere is strongly heated by the braking plasma, reaching temperatures of 30–40 keV, while its denser isothermal interior is much cooler (~2 keV). We numerically solve the polarized radiative transfer in the atmosphere with magnetic Compton scattering, free-free processes, and non-thermal cyclotron emission due to possible collisional excitations of electrons. The strongly polarized emitted spectrum has a double-hump shape that is observed in low-luminosity X-ray pulsars. A low-energy “thermal” component is dominated by extraordinary photons that can leave the atmosphere from deeper layers due to their long mean free path at soft energies. We find that a high-energy component is formed due to resonant Comptonization in the heated non-isothermal part of the atmosphere even in the absence of collisional excitations. The latter, however, affect the ratio of the two components. A strong cyclotron line originates from the optically thin, uppermost zone. A fit of the model to NuSTAR and Swift/XRT observations of GX304􀀀1 provides an accurate description of the data with reasonable parameters. The model can thus reproduce the characteristic double-hump spectrum observed in low-luminosity X-ray pulsars and provides insights into spectral formation."

A small experimental setup was utilized to test the PEEK sample between temperatures of 300 K and 525 K at atmospheric pressure. Cylindrical plugs of PEEK with three thermocouples embedded at various depths were incorporated in the test sample. The experimental PEEK thermocouple data were used as the boundary and initial conditions of a one-dimensional numerical thermal model to predict the internal temperatures of the material. The thermal conductivity of PEEK was estimated with the Continuous Genetic Algorithm optimization technique by searching for the coefficients of a functional form of thermal conductivity that minimized the difference between the experimentally measured and model predicted internal temperature values. The thermal testing, one-dimensional numerical thermal model, optimization algorithm, analysis, and results are presented."

Originally developed for the BioSentinel CubeSat mission to study the response of a wild type and mutant strain of yeast to the deep space environment, the BioSensor consists of a series of 16-well, independently plumbed fluidics cards. The cards utilize filters to allow the fluidic system to administer reagents while constraining the microbes in their wells. Heaters on each card incubate to the appropriate growth temperature once the experiment begins. During the active experiment, the LED/detector system measures the transmission of light through each well at three specific wavelengths, similar to a standard benchtop spectrophotometer. The transmission/absorbance kinetics curves for each well are telemetered back to Earth, along with temperature data, for analysis on the ground.

Due to increased irrigation and resultant land-use–land-cover change, the central United States has seen a decrease in temperature and changes in precipitation during the second half of the twentieth century. To investigate the impacts of widespread commencement of irrigation at the beginning of the growing season and continued irrigation throughout the summer on local and regional weather, the Great Plains Irrigation Experiment (GRAINEX) was conducted in the spring and summer of 2018 in southeastern Nebraska. GRAINEX consisted of two 15-day intensive observation periods. Observational platforms from multiple agencies and universities were deployed to investigate the role of irrigation in surface moisture content, heat fluxes, diurnal boundary layer evolution, and local precipitation. This article provides an overview of the data collected and an analysis of the role of irrigation in land–atmosphere interactions on time scales from the seasonal to the diurnal. The analysis shows that a clear irrigation signal was apparent during the peak growing season in mid-July. This paper shows the strong impact of irrigation on surface fluxes, near-surface temperature and humidity, and boundary layer growth and decay."

In addition to their impact on the Earth’s climate system, aerosols from volcanic eruptions, wildfires, man-made pollution events and dust storms are hazardous to aviation safety and human health. Space-based lidar systems provide critical information about the vertical distributions of clouds and aerosols that greatly improve our understanding of the climate system. However, daytime data from backscatter lidars, such as the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) on the International Space Station (ISS), must be averaged during science processing at the expense of spatial resolution to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for accurately detecting atmospheric features. For example, 50% of all atmospheric features reported in daytime operational CATS data products require averaging to 60 km for detection. Furthermore, the single-wavelength nature of the CATS primary operation mode makes accurately typing these features challenging in complex scenes. This paper presents machine learning (ML) techniques that, when applied to CATS data, (1) increased the 1064 nm SNR by 75%, (2) increased the number of layers detected (any resolution) by 30%, and (3) enabled detection of 40% more atmospheric features during daytime operations at a horizontal resolution of 5 km compared to the 60 km horizontal resolution often required for daytime CATS operational data products. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained using CATS standard data products also demonstrated the potential for improved cloud-aerosol discrimination compared to the operational CATS algorithms for cloud edges and complex near-surface scenes during daytime."

The most significant results of our investigation are: 1. The primary X-ray emission from the corona is constant in these observations, both in terms of the power law slope (Γ = 1.80) and luminosity (L2−10 keV= 2.55×1044erg s−1). 2.The soft excess flux decreased by a factor of two in 2016, the Compton hump weakened/vanished in2016, and the narrow FeKαemission line became marginally broad (σ= 0.35±0.08 keV) and its flux doubled in 2016. 3. From physical model fits we find that the normalization of the narrow component of the FeKαline does not change in the two epochs, although the Compton hump vanishes in the same time span. Since the primary X-ray continuum does not change, we presume that any changes in there processed emission must arise due to changes in the reprocessing media. Our primary conclusions are: A. The vanishing of the Compton hump in 2016 can probably be explained by a dynamic clumpytorus which is infalling/outflowing, or by a polar torus wind. B. The torus in this AGN possibly has two structures: an equatorial toroidal disk (producing the narrow FeKαemission) and a polar component(producing the variable Compton hump), C. The reduction of the soft-excess flux by half and increase in the FeKαflux by a factor of two in the same period cannot be adequately explained by ionized disk reflection model alone."

In this paper we describe an updated unified approach to EPIC calibration. In this approach, calibration coefficients and their trends were obtained by comparing EPIC observations to the measurements from polar orbiting radiometers. In this study L1B reflectances from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) onboard Terra and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) spacecraft were used to infer calibration coefficients for four EPIC visible and near-infrared channels: 443 nm, 551 nm, 680 nm, and 780 nm. EPIC Version three measurements made between June 2015 and August 2020 were used for comparison. The calibration procedure identifies the most homogeneous low Earth orbit radiometer scenes matching scattering angles that are temporarily and spatially collocated with EPIC observations. These scenes are used to determine reflectance to count (R/C) ratios in spectrally analogous channels. Seasonal average R/C ratios were analyzed to obtain EPIC calibration gains and trends. The trends for the full dataset period are not statistically significant except in the 443 nm channel. No significant changes in calibration were found after the instrument’s exit from safe hold in March 2020. The R/C ratios were also used to determine the differences in EPIC gains resulting from separate calibrations: against MODIS Aqua or Terra, as well as against forward or aftward MISR cameras. Statistical tests indicate that the differences between the two datasets are not significant except in the 780 nm channels where Aqua-derived coefficients may be around 2% lower compared to Terra. The dependence of EPIC calibration gains on the instrument scattering angle and on DSCOVR-Earth distance were investigated. Lastly, model Low Earth Orbit (LEO) reflectances calculated to match the EPIC viewing geometry were employed to study how EPIC calibration coefficients depend on EPIC-LEO viewing geometry differences. The effect of LEO and EPIC angular mismatch on calibration was shown to be small."

In this current study a wider range of impact energies were utilized and the CAI strength assessed with these different damage severity levels. This was done to provide a more complete database for the two types of sandwich structure tested in these studies. In addition, the honeycomb sandwich specimens were tested with both the ‘L’ and ‘W’ directions aligned with the axis of compression loading. As in the study examining CAI strength with BVID1, the results were normalized by the mass of the sandwich structure. The results showed that the CAI strength did differ depending on the orientation of the core during testing and that when tested in the W-direction, the honeycomb core sandwich structure had about the same CAI strength as the foam core sandwich structure when normalized by the mass of the sandwich structures."

This study presents the development of the full coupling between the Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) and the HyMAP flood model in the NASA Land Information System and its application over the Inner Niger Delta (IND), a well-known hot-spot of strong land surface-atmosphere interactions in West Africa. Here, we define two experiments at 0.02o spatial resolution over 2002-2018 to quantify the impacts of the proposed developments on simulating IND dynamics. One represents the one-way approach for simulating land surface and flooding processes (1-WAY), i.e., Noah-MP neglects surface water availability, and the proposed two-way coupling (2-WAY), where Noah-MP takes surface water availability into account in the vertical water and energy balance. Results show that accounting for two-way interactions between Noah- MP and HyMAP over IND improves simulations of all selected hydrological variables. Compared to 1-WAY, evapotranspiration derived from 2-WAY over flooding zones doubles, increased by 0.8mm/day, resulting in an additional water loss rate of ~18,900km(exp 3)/year, ~40% drop of wetland extent during wet seasons and major improvement in simulated water level variability at multiple locations. Significant soil moisture increase and surface temperature drop were also observed. Wetland outflows decreased by 35%, resulting in a substantial a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient improvement, from -0.73 to 0.79. It is anticipated that future developments in water monitoring and water-related disaster warning systems will considerably benefit from these findings."

Because the species are indistinguishable based on external morphology, little research focused on Carolina hammerheads exists. In this study, the distribution of Carolina hammerheads in waters of the United States off the east coast (U.S. Atlantic) and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) was examined and their abundance relative to scalloped hammerheads assessed by genetically identifying 1,232 individuals using diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Both species were found in the U.S. Atlantic, where 27% of individuals were Carolina hammerheads, but only scalloped hammerheads were identified in the Gulf. In Bulls Bay, SC, a well-known hammerhead nursery, assessment of relative abundance from May to September showed scalloped hammerheads were more abundant May-June and Carolina hammerheads more abundant July-September. Results of this study suggest Carolina hammerheads have a spatially limited distribution in the western North Atlantic and highlight the importance of Bulls Bay as a nursery for the species. In addition, the results suggest Carolina hammerheads may comprise a non-trivial proportion of what is considered the U.S. Atlantic scalloped hammerhead stock and should be considered in future decisions regarding management of the hammerhead complex."

For climate-sensitive diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, climate appears to have opposing effects in different contexts. Here we show that a model, parameterized with laboratory measured climate-driven mosquito physiology, captures three key epidemic characteristics across ecologically and culturally distinct settings in Ecuador and Kenya: the number, timing, and duration of outbreaks. The model generates a range of disease dynamics consistent with observed Aedes aegypti abundances and laboratory-confirmed arboviral incidence with variable accuracy (28–85% for vectors, 44–88% for incidence). The model predicted vector dynamics better in sites with a smaller proportion of young children in the population, lower mean temperature, and homes with piped water and made of cement. Models with limited calibration that robustly capture climate-virus relationships can help guide intervention efforts and climate change disease projections."

To mitigate such errors, a land surface analysis is included in many such systems, although not yet in the currently operational NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) ADAS. This article investigates the assimilation of L-band brightness temperature (Tb) observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission in the GEOS weakly coupled land–atmosphere data assimilation system (LADAS) during boreal summer 2017. The SMAP Tb analysis improves the correlation of LADAS surface and root-zone soil moisture versus in situ measurements by ∼0.1–0.26 over that of ADAS estimates; the unbiased root-mean-square error of LADAS soil moisture is reduced by 0.002–0.008 m^3 /m^3 from that of ADAS. Furthermore, the global land average RMSE versus in situ measurements of screen-level air specific humidity (q2m) and daily maximum temperature (T2m_max ) is reduced by 0.05 g/kg and 0.04 K, respectively, for LADAS compared to ADAS estimates. Regionally, the RMSE of LADAS q2m and T2m_max is improved by up to 0.4 g/kg and 0.3 K, respectively. Improvement in LADAS specific humidity extends into the lower troposphere (below ∼700 mb), with relative improvements in bias of 15–25%, although LADAS air temperature bias slightly increases relative to that of ADAS. Finally, the root mean square of the LADAS Tb observation-minus-forecast residuals is smaller by up to ∼0.1 K than in a land-only assimilation system, corroborating the positive impact of the Tb analysis on the modeled land–atmosphere coupling."

In 2017, a model function has been developed based on measurement data at 1.4134 GHz using a third-order polynomial expression in salinity (S) and temperature (T). Although the model showed improvements in salinity retrieval, it had an inconsistent behavior between partitioned salinities. To improve the stability of the model, new dielectric measurements of seawater have been made recently over a broad range of salinities and temperatures to expand the data set used for developing the model function. The structure of the model function has been changed from a polynomial expansion in S and T to a physics-based model consisting of a Debye molecular resonance term plus a conductivity term. Each unknown parameter is expressed in S and T based on the expanded measurement data set. Physical arguments have been used to limit the number of unknown coefficients in these expressions to improve the stability of the model function. The new model function has been employed in the retrieval algorithm of the Aquarius satellite mission to obtain a global salinity map. The retrieved salinity using a different model function is compared with in situ data collected by Argo floats to evaluate the impact and the performance of model functions. The results indicate that the new model function has significant improvements in salinity retrieval compared with other existing models."

Also, a simple change of the Wilcox model is introduced to improve computational predictions for transonic flows. Computations for flows over two different airfoils are examined to compare these turbulence models. Effects on modeling the physics of each flow due to variations in the models, such as using either strainrate or vorticity in the turbulence production term, are considered and discussed. The second objective of this report is to not only explore but also evaluate the performance of the solution algorithm for the mean flow and the transport equations. The RANS and turbulence modeling equations aresolved in a weakly coupled manner with a diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) solution algorithm. Throughout this report, emphasis is given to reducing the residuals to machine zero in all flow calculations, so as to eliminate the error due to numerical integration of the discrete governing equations. The final objective is to provide a perspective on solving transport equations for turbulence modeling. Aspects of solving such stiff systems of equations, as well as various numerical difficulties and possible techniques to overcome them, are considered. Discussion is also provided concerning what is called ’numerical compatibility’, which is an essential requirement when designing a solution algorithm for solving transport equations."

The NASA contribution to the campaign was conducted in 2016 with the NASA LVIS (Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor) Lidar, the NASA L-band UAVSAR (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar). A central motivation for the AfriSAR deployment was the common AGBD estimation requirement for the three future spaceborne missions, the lack of sufficient airborne and ground calibration data covering the full range of ABGD in tropical forest systems, and the intercomparison and fusion of the technologies.
During the campaign, over 7000 km2 of waveform Lidar data from LVIS and 30000 km2 of UAVSAR data were collected over 10 key sites and transects. In addition, field measurements of forest structure and biomass were collected in sixteen 1 hectare sized plots. The campaign produced gridded Lidar canopy structure products, gridded aboveground biomass and associated uncertainties, Lidar based vegetation canopy cover profile products, Polarimetric Interferometric SAR and Tomographic SAR products and field measurements. Our results showcase the types of data products and scientific results expected from the spaceborne Lidar and SAR missions; we also expect that the AfriSAR campaign data will facilitate further analysis and use of waveform Lidar and multiple baseline polarimetric SAR datasets for carbon cycle, biodiversity, water resources and more applications by the greater scientific community."

This class of miniature spacecraft is well-suited for a set of nonconventional satellite architectures collectively known as formation flying.  With the exponential pace of launches expected to continue, the prospect of spectrum management for these complex formations arises.  In previous work, investigators focus on terrestrial applications of spectrum sensing, which have the luxury to utilize hardware with high size, weight, and power (SWaP) resources.  In this work, we develop and test a spectrum sensor for CubeSat radio applications.

Given that CubeSat radios are inherently designed for low SWaP, they cannot implement the computationally expensive spectral correlation analyzer (SCA) algorithms for signal detection.  To that end, our investigation focuses on the application of the SCA to square-root-raised-cosine (SRRC) pulse-shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) waveforms using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).  This model requires no prior knowledge of the radio-frequency (RF) channel.  We show that this model can consistently and accurately detect the symbol rate and center frequencies of waveforms located in a spectrum."

Yet, polar orbiting satellites are unable to fully capture daytime variability  and individual geostationary satellites only provide measurements for portions of  the Earth.  In  addition,  diurnal  cloud  fraction  variations  analyzed  with  General  Circulation  Models provide results that cannot be reconciled with observations in many situations. Here we show that the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) aboard the DSCOVR satellite presents a unique opportunity to examine changes in daytime global cloud fraction resolved at one-hour frequency. For  the  first  time,  we  characterize  the  global  daytime  variability  of  clouds  with  a  single  sensor, presenting evidence that the fraction of liquid clouds reaches its maximum over continental areas and  its  minimum  over  ocean  around  noon.  We  compare  our  results  with  previous  global  and regional studies and examine implications for the Earth's energy budget."

Earth observation (EO) data can fill key knowledge gaps, and can be rapidly used in settings with lower analytical capacity. In this study, we describe a novel series of methods designed to analyze landslide susceptibility, hazard and exposure in the region in and around the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where limited data is juxtaposed with a major humanitarian crisis. We demonstrate that a high degree of accuracy is possible even when estimating susceptibility of relatively small landslides. In the context of this example, we also explore how estimates of landslide hazard and exposure are most beneficial to decisions made by humanitarian stakeholders relevant to natural hazards and risk. The unique opportunity to work alongside humanitarian end-users has allowed us to produce focused products that can be tested while in development. In particular, we stress the importance of communicating the difference between a landslide ‘early warning system’ –for which satellite data may be unsuitable at local scales –and a model that provides relative hazard estimates, where EO may be valuable. The toolbox of methods presented here could be used to generate landslide hazard and exposure maps in other data-poor regions around the globe."

Because of its significance, forestland was identified through the National Climate Assessment(NCA) as a key sector and system of concern to be included in a system of climate indicators as part of a sustained assessment effort. Here, we describe 11 informative core indicators of forests and climate change impacts with metrics available or nearly available for use in the NCA efforts. The recommended indicators are based on a comprehensive conceptual model which recognizes forests as a land use, an ecosystem, and an economic sector. The indicators cover major forest attributes such as extent, structural components such as biomass, functions such as growth and productivity, and ecosystem services such as biodiversity and outdoor recreation. Interactions between humans and forests are represented through indicators focused on the wildland-urban interface, cost to mitigate wildfire risk, and energy produced from forest-based biomass. Selected indicators also include drought and disturbance from both wildfires and biotic agents. The forest indicators presented are an initial set that will need further refinement in coordination with other NCA indicator teams. Our effort ideally will initiate the collection of critical measurements and observations and lead to additional research on forest-climate indicators."

They then offer data products to disseminate the aggregate information, like newsletters, alerts or individual report searching. The goal of this research is to connect these individual reports thematically and temporally to identify emerging or recurring threats, by analyzing large collections of text, source code, collaboration and communication patterns. This capability, I argue, enables us to identify the emergence and recurrence of such themes, and the contexts in which they re-occur, facilitating faster and more capable mitigation. I propose two models to shed light on this goal: An empirical model of vulnerabilities as bugs, the commit flow model, and one of the vulnerabilities and aviation safety threats as topics, the topic flow model. I use as gold standard existing manual workflows in both domains, reflected in the existing data products by these organizations, and empirically evaluate if the automated model scan match or outperform existing manual practices."

Immersion freezing initiated by ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is the dominant pathway of primary ice crystal formation in mixed-phase clouds, where supercooled water droplets and ice crystals coexist, with important implications for the hydrological cycle and climate. However, derivation of INP number concentrations from an ambient aerosol population in cloud-resolving and climate models remains highly uncertain. We conducted an aerosol-ice formation closure pilot study using a field-observational approach to evaluate the predictive capability of immersion freezing INPs. The closure study relies on co-located measurements of the ambient size-resolved and single-particle composition and INP number concentrations. The acquired particle data serve as input in several immersion freezing parameterizations, that are employed in cloud-resolving and climate models, for prediction of INP number concentrations. We discuss in detail one closure  case study in which a front passed through the measurement site, resulting in a change of ambient particle and INP populations. We achieved closure in some circumstances within uncertainties, but we emphasize the need for freezing parameterization of potentially missing INP types and evaluation of the choice of parameterization to be employed. Overall, this closure pilot study aims to assess the level of parameter details and measurement strategies needed to achieve aerosol-ice formation closure. The closure approach is designed to accurately guide immersion freezing schemes in models, and ultimately identify the leading causes for climate model bias in INP predictions."

To test whether Bennu’s color and albedo diversity could be caused by texture and/or composition variations, we performed a laboratory-based study using simple two-component mixtures (called “mudpies”) of the phyllosilicate saponite and carbon-rich opaques. Each mudpie is prepared in four different textures: fine powder, coarse particles, sanded slab, and textured rock. We find that a sanded slab made from 90% saponite and 10% lampblack is a good analog for Bennu, and the color and albedo changes due to texture variations are substantial. At 550 nm, texture changes alone can create up to 36% brightness contrast, and in color measured as a 473 nm/847 nm ratio, texture changes can provide up to 18% color contrast. In comparison, Bennu shows approximately 25% albedo and <1% color contrasts from boulder type to boulder type. These findings suggest that if texture contributes to color on Bennu, the texture variations are typically more subtle than what we simulated in the laboratory. According to our study, the color and albedo properties of different boulder types on Bennu are consistent with different concentrations of carbon-rich opaques (and possibly consistent with variations in carbonate concentration). The variations within each boulder group are consistent with textural differences."

Here  we  postulate  that  complex  molecules  found  in  high abundance are universal biosignatures as they cannot form by chance. To explore this,  we  developed  the  first  intrinsic  measure  of  molecular  complexity that  can  be  experimentally  determined,  and  this  is  based  upon  a  new  approach called  assembly  theory which gives the molecular assembly number (MA) of a given molecule. MA allows us to compare the intrinsic complexity of molecules using the minimum number of steps required to construct the molecular graph starting from basic objects, and a probabilistic model  shows  how  the  probability  of  any  given  molecule  forming  randomly  drops  dramatically as its MA increases.  To map chemical space, we calculated the MA of ca. 2.5 million compounds, and collected data which showed the complexity of a molecule can be experimentally determined  by  using  three  independent  techniques  including  infra-red spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and by fragmentation in a mass spectrometer, and  this  data  has  an  excellent  corelation  with  the  values  predicted  from  our  assembly  theory.  We then set  out  to  see  if  this  approach  could  allow  us  to  identify  molecular  biosignatures with a set of diverse samples from around the world, outer space, and the laboratory including prebiotic soups. The results show that there is a non-living to living threshold in MA complexity and the higher the MA for a given molecule, the more likely that it had to be produced by a biological process. This work demonstrates it is possible to  use  this  approach  to  build  a  life  detection  instrument  that could  be  deployed  on  missions  to  extra-terrestrial  locations  to  detect  biosignatures,  map  the  extent  of  life  on  Earth, and be used as a molecular complexity scale to quantify the constraints needed to direct prebiotically plausible processes in the laboratory. Such an approach is vital if we are going to find new life elsewhere in the universe or create de-novo life in the lab."

To understand the convective cloud development process, this study investigates the impact of aerosols on convective clouds by considering the influence of both topography and diurnal variation in radiation. By combining texture analysis, clustering, and thresholding methods, we identify all convective clouds in two warm seasons (May–September, 2016/17) in eastern China based on Himawari-8 Level 1 data. Having large diurnally resolved cloud data together with surface meteorological and environmental measurements, we investigate convective cloud properties and their variation, stratified by elevation and diurnal change. We then analyze the potential impact of aerosol on convective clouds under different meteorological conditions and topographies. In general, convective clouds tend to occur preferentially under polluted conditions in the morning, which reverses in the afternoon. Convective cloud fraction first increases then decreases with aerosol loading, which may contribute to this phenomenon. Topography and diurnal meteorological variations may affect the strength of aerosol microphysical and radiative effects. Updraft is always stronger along the windward slopes of mountains and plateaus, especially in northern China. The prevailing southerly wind near the foothills of mountains and plateaus is likely to contribute to this windward strengthening of updraft and to bring more pollutant into the mountains, thereby strengthening the microphysical effect, invigorating convective clouds. By comparison, over plain, aerosols decrease surface heating and suppress convection by blocking solar radiation reaching the surface."

This allowed us to diagnose the electron density in both EBITs. We compared our experimental resonant energies and strengths with those of previous independent work at a storage ring as well as those of configuration interaction, multiconfiguration Dirac–Fock calculations, and many-body perturbation theory.

GRS 1915+105 being one of the brightest transient black hole binaries (BHBs) in the X-rays offers a unique testbed for the study of the connection between accretion and ejection mechanisms in BHBs. In particular, this source can be used to study the accretion disc wind and its dependence on the state changes in BHBs.

Aims. Our aim is to investigate the origin and geometry of the accretion disc wind in GRS 1915+105. This study will provide a basis for planning future observations with the X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), and may also provide important parameters for estimating the polarimetric signal with the upcoming Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).

Methods. We analysed the spectra of GRS 1915+105 in the soft ϕ and hard χ classes using the high-resolution spectroscopy offered by Chandra HETGS. In the soft state, we find a series of wind absorption lines that follow a non-linear dependence of velocity width, velocity shift, and equivalent width with respect to ionisation, indicating a multiple component or stratified outflow. In the hard state we find only a faint Fe XXVI absorption line. We model the absorption lines in both the states using a dedicated magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) wind model to investigate a magnetic origin of the wind and to probe the cause of variability in the observed line flux between the two states.

Conclusions. The MHD disc wind model provides a good fit for both states, indicating the possibility of a magnetic origin of the wind. The multiple ionisation components of the wind are well characterised as a stratification of the same magnetic outflow. We find that the observed variability in the line flux between soft and hard states cannot be explained by photo-ionisation alone but is most likely due to a large (three orders of magnitude) increase in the wind density. We find the mass outflow rate of the wind to be comparable to the accretion rate, suggesting an intimate link between accretion and ejection processes that lead to state changes in BHBs."

Monitoring changes in a barrier island system helps determine the combined effect of sediment supply, aeolian sand transport, storms and sea level rise (SLR) on long-term island survival. Here we present and discuss changes to the southern end of Padre Island (TX),including a back-barrier active dune field, across 7 decades from 1941 - 2020. We have used aerial photos, satellite imagery, and field monitoring to map the decadal and seasonal geomorphological changes. We produced facies maps for each decade from 1970 to present, complemented   with   qualitative   observations   for   1941-1970,   when   aerial   imagery   was incomplete. We also used supervised classification to monitor monthly changes in the availability of sand for aeolian transport over a full seasonal cycle, to determine the role of the fluctuating water table on the sand budget of the active dune field. Results indicate that the southern end of Padre Island experienced significant change over the study period, transitioning from unvegetated dune fields and sand flats to expansive vegetated dunes, a tidal flat with microbial mats and a shrinking active dune field. Vegetated dunes, absent in 1970, now cover 14% of the study area. The active dune field shrunk from 12%coverage to 6%, with sand available for transport varying from 3% to 21% as the water table fluctuates throughout the year. The infrequently flooded back-island sand flat covering 40% of the study area has transitioned to a lower-lying tidal flat. Furthermore, extensive microbial mats and crusts have developed within the wind-tidal flat, in washover fans, and in low-lying interdune areas. All these early signs are consistent with a progressive drowning of the barrier island, an event we hypothesize was triggered by the sudden spread of vegetation along the back-beach dunes. Plant colonization then cut off sand supply from the beach to the back-barrier, and thus access to the primary source of sand to the system. Our findings highlight the contradictory role of vegetation in barrier islands, as they stabilize dunes and promote sand accretion at the back-beach, while also isolating the back-barrier from aeolian sediment sources, thus amplifying the effects of sea level rise in the absence of salt marshes and/or mangrove platforms."

In this paper, we present a system that performs three functions: 1) monitors an operator’s physiological state; 2) assesses when the operator is experiencing anomalous states; and 3) mitigates risks by a combination of dynamic, context-based unilateral or collaborative dynamic function allocation of operational tasks.  The monitoring process receives high data-rate sensor values from eye-tracking and electrocardiogram sensors.  The assessment process takes these values and performs a classification that was developed using machine learning algorithms.  The mitigation process invokes a collaboration protocol called DFACCto which, based on context, performs vehicle operations that the operator would otherwise routinely execute. This system has been demonstrated in a UAM flight simulator for an operator incapacitation scenario.  The methods and initial results as well as relevant UAM and AAM scenarios will be described."

Unlike environmental testing of dedicated qualification hardware, ordnance devices have a test-like-you-fly exception and use lot acceptance sampling or LAT. LAT is performed by randomly selecting a predefined number of devices from an individual lot and exposing them to a more severe dynamic shock and vibration testing environments than flight (sometimes as high as six decibels over flight environments) and then performing a destructive test on the device. Recent trends have been suggested to reduce LAT costs by reducing environment test levels or the number of devices per LAT, or both. A method is given here to compute flight risk, so the proposed methods can be compared by subject matter experts to the baseline LAT methods. In addition, this method can be used to determine the best methods to include in future LAT standards for pyrotechnic devices."

The next phase of experiments will involve an NACA 0015-based swept wing, as prior risk reduction experiments had indicated that this wing shape resulted in reduced separation near the juncture region than the DLR-F6 wing, thus providing a better option to evaluate the ability of CFD models to predict incipient turbulent separation. The NACA 0015 measurements will also include IR thermography to infer the variation of transition front with respect to an increasing angle of attack. The primary objective of this work is to computationally make a preliminary assessment of the transition front on both surfaces of the NACA 0015 wing at a crank-chord-based Reynolds number of 2.4 x 106 for four different angles of attack, (0°, 2.5°, 5°, and 7.5°) and to determine the dominant mechanisms responsible for transition. This assessment includes both RANS-based transition models from NASA’s OVERFLOW 2.3b flow solver and linear parabolized stability equations (PSE) stability analysis based on the Langley Stability and Transition Analysis code, LASTRAC. Linear PSE results indicate that the upper surface of the wing is dominated by Tollmien- Schlichting (TS) instabilities, and that the laminar flow region shrinks from about 50% chord to a very small region just downstream of the attachment line as the angle of attack is increased from 0° to 7.5°. Consequently, the transition fronts predicted by the Spalart- Allmaras-based amplification factor transport (AFT-2017b) equation model (which accounts for the TS instabilities alone) and the Menter’s shear-stress transport equation (SST2003)- based Langtry-Menter transition model with ability to account for both TS and crossflow effects (LM2015) compare well with those predicted using linear PSE. On the lower surface of the wing, stationary crossflow (CF) instabilities begin to appear on the inboard portion of the wing in addition to the TS-instabilities for the larger angles of attack (5° and 7.5°), further reducing the laminar flow extent within the inboard region. The LM2015 model that accounts for CF effects is able to replicate this trend but appears to predict a slightly earlier transition. The outcome of this effort will inform the experiment and, when the actual experimental data become available, provide further opportunity to assess and improve the various transition models."

Architectural and behavioral models provide important information that can be leveraged to improve the system safety analysis process. Model-based design artifacts produced in early stage development activities can be used to perform system safety analysis, reducing costs and providing accurate results throughout the system life-cycle. In this report we describe an extension to the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) that supports modeling of system behavior under failure conditions. This Safety Annex enables the independent modeling of component failures and allows safety engineers to weave various types of fault behavior into the nominal system model. The accompanying tool support uses model checking to propagate errors from their source to their effect on safety properties without the need to add separate propagation specifications. The tool also captures all minimal set of fault combinations that can cause violation of the safety properties, that can be compared to qualitative and quantitative objectives as part of the safety assessment process. We describe the Safety Annex, illustrate its use with a representative example, and discuss and demonstrate the tool support enabling an analyst to investigate the system behavior under failure conditions."

With the goal of evaluating the available engineering models for predicting the effects of step excrescences on the transition characteristics, two separate methodologies are used to monitor the streamwise shift in the transition onset location as the step height and the flow speed are varied across the range of a previously reported experiment involving step-height-to-local-displacement-thickness ratios of 0 < <i>h/δ*</i> < 1.6. Unlike the variable <i>N</i>-factor method from the previous literature, both of these methods are general in scope and do not involve any empirical correlations that are specific to step excrescences. The first of these techniques involves an <i>N</i>-factor method that directly accounts for the change in boundary-layer instability characteristics due to the step. Stability computations using the harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE), which fully account for the nonparallel-mean-flow effects close to the BFS, indicate that the measured transition locations at nearly all test conditions (<i>h/δ*</i> < 1.3) correlate well with a computed <i>N</i>-factor of <i>N<sub>tr</sub></i> = 7.6, demonstrating a successful stability-based transition criterion related to step excrescences. Linear stability theory, which does not account for nonparallel effects, demonstrates reasonable agreement with the HLNSE results, yielding good predictions for the overall trends, but predicts a somewhat earlier onset of transition than HLNSE. The other methodology used in this work involves transport-equation-based transition models. We first show that the Langtry-Menter <i>y - Re<sub>θt</sub></i> transition model cannot accurately predict the location of transition onset for moderate BFS heights because it is unable to accurately account for the flow history effects. Along with the Langtry-Menter transition model, we also show the amplification factor transport model does not produce accurate transition locations for subsonic flow over steps even though it accounts for some flow history effects."

HAAs were detected in both the acid hydrolysates of the hot water extracts and the 6 M HCl extracts of all the CM and CR chondrites analyzed here with total hot water and HCl extractable HAA concentrations ranging from 6.94 to 315 nmol/g. The HAA analyses performed in this study revealed: (1) the combined (hot water + HCl) extracts of CR2 chondrites contained greater abundances of α-HAAs than that of CM2 chondrites and (2) the combined extracts of CM and CR chondrites contained roughly similar abundances of β- and γ-HAAs. Application of the new GC-MS method developed here resulted in the first successful chromatographic resolution of the enantiomers of an α-dialkyl HAA, d,l-α-methylserine, in carbonaceous chondrite extracts. Meteoritic α-methylserine was found to be mostly racemic within error and did not show l-enantiomeric excesses correlating with the degree of aqueous alteration, a phenomenon observed in meteoritic isovaline, another α-dialkyl amino acid. The HAAs identified in CM and CR chondrite extracts could have been produced during parent body alteration from the Strecker cyanohydrin reaction (for α-HAAs) and an ammonia-involved formose-like reaction (for β-, and γ-HAAs)."

For example, during extra-vehicular activity (EVA) and telerobotic operations, the sensory restrictions associated with such a hostile environment provide a major challenge to maintaining the situation awareness (SA) required for safe operations. In particular, orientation, navigation, and collision avoidance are critical aspects of EVA tasks that need to be addressed to ensure the safety of the crew and the success of the mission. Multimodal displays hold promise to enhance situation awareness and task performance by utilizing different sensory modalities and maximizing their effectiveness based on appropriate interaction between modalities. 
      Multimodal displays will also play an important role for long-duration information systems and will likely begin to be developed in the early phases of cislunar Gateway, and later lunar or Mars transit missions. Information systems are envisioned for LDEMs that require spacecraft with greater crew autonomy and increased dependence on computer-provided information needed to perform routine tasks, as well as time- and safety critical tasks. Such a system will require a single, common interface that is easy to learn and use and accesses key information from all relevant vehicle/habitat systems to enable task performance in both nominal and emergency conditions. Understanding of multimodal display technologies and their interactions will help to inform interface guidelines for LDEMs.
      The scope of the current report is an analysis of potential multimodal display technologies for long duration missions and, in particular, will focus on their potential role in EVA activities. The review will address multimodal (combined visual, auditory and/or tactile) displays investigated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), industry, and Department of Defense (DoD). It also considers the need for adaptive information systems to accommodate a variety of operational contexts such as crew status (e.g., fatigue, workload level) and task environment (e.g., EVA, habitat, rover, spacecraft). Current approaches to guidelines and best practices for combining modalities for the most effective information displays are also reviewed. Potential issues in developing interface guidelines for LDEMs are briefly considered."

During the past few of years, there have been two major changes that have affected the management of the science associated with the CNS risk.  The first major change was the integration of several related risks: CNS (C), Behavioral medicine (B), and sensorimotor (S) to be managed as an integrated effort called CBS. CBS was formed to accelerate research on combined spaceflight stressors, specifically space radiation, microgravity, isolation, and confinement. CBS was managed by Human Factors and Behavioral Performance (HFBP) with support and inputs from Space Radiation as well as Human Health Countermeasures. Secondly, and more recently, the CNS risk was absorbed by the behavioral medicine risk currently also held by HFPB. As a result, the gaps associated with CNS were removed and aspects of them are represented in the BMED gaps (link). However, due to recent changes in element leadership, budget, and timeline, extensive restructuring of CBS is in progress. In addition, in an effort to harmonize datasets to be used in modelling efforts, an Animal Standardization TIM was held in June 2021 to standardize the type of behavioral and cognitive tasks as well as experimental set-ups. This presentation is an effort to communicate with the radiation research community concerning the strategy, management, and future of the former central nervous system risk and the role of the Space Radiation Element."

Kedro, an open-source pipeline framework, is used to develop the model definition and training. Models are stored in scikit-learn containers on a MLFlow server where they can be retrieved and served to make predictions in the live system. These open source frameworks provide common structures between ML services, allow for easier maintenance and updates, and overall deliver an easier CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process. The current models were trained on data acquired at KCLT and KDFW from June 1st to December 31st, 2019 and compute taxi time in the ramp, airport movement area (AMA) and total (from gates to runways). The current versions of the models achieve relatively low uncertainties of about 10 to 15% for the total and AMA taxi times and about 20% for the ramp taxi time at both KCLT and KDFW. Initial tests on offline data from 2020 and 2021 show a small degradation (10 to 15%) in accuracy performance indicating the model’s resilience to operational changes over time."

The preliminary work presented here extends our prior research on developing an impedance based complexity metric for unmanned aircraft system traffic scenario classification. Impedance based metric was evaluated for 1045 randomly-generated scenarios. Scenarios with overall impedance above a certain threshold were declared as no-go. A ground delay approach was developed to be applied to the rest of the scenarios so as to remediate any scenarios with small areas of high impedance on their impedance maps. A sample application is shown for a scenario with sixty flights. The final paper will include detailed trade-offs between overall accrued system delay and the delay tolerance for each aircraft. A sample application to a potential Urban Air Mobility traffic scenario will also be included in the final paper.

In this research, we describe our efforts training machine learning (ML) models to predict both departure and arrival runway assignments using an entirely data-driven approach. This approach is compared to existing rule-based approaches developed in previous research using input from Subject Matter Experts. The models have features derived from various FAA data feeds, and leverage multiple machine learning algorithms. Results for models trained for nine major U.S. airports are described and compared to one another across various important dimensions. Particular attention was paid to developing a repeatable framework for training these models so the approach could be scaled to other airports, and to developing models that are useful in a real-time environment. In addition, the models were designed to be functional in a real-time environment to support NASA’s ATD-2 project, as part of an ML-powered shadow system to compare against the performance of the fielded system."

To examine the relationships, we analyzed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). Our investigation based on this state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis data reveals that 13 out of the 20 months with the highest PM2.5 (corresponding to the highly elevated organic carbon in the particulate organic matter [POM] form) monthly mean mass concentration over the Arctic for 2003–2017 were all in summer (July and August), during which POM of ⩾0.5 μg/cu. m and PM2.5 were positively correlated. This correlation suggests that high PM2.5 in the Arctic is linked to large wildfire contributions and characterized by significant anticyclonic anomalies (i.e. clockwise atmospheric circulation) with anomalous surface warmth and drier conditions over Siberia and subpolar North America, in addition to Europe. A similar climate pattern was also identified through an independent regression analysis for the July and August mean data between the same atmospheric variables and the sign-reversed Scandinavian pattern index. We named this pattern of recent atmospheric circulation anomalies the circum-Arctic wave (CAW) pattern as a manifestation of eastward group-velocity propagation of stationary Rossby waves (i.e. large-scale atmospheric waves). The CAW induces concomitant development of warm anticyclonic anomalies over Europe, Siberia, Alaska, and Canada, as observed in late June 2019. Surprisingly, the extended regression analysis of the 1980–2017 period revealed that the CAW pattern was not prominent before 2003. Understanding the CAW pattern under future climate change and global warming would lead to better prediction of co-occurrences of European heatwaves and large-scale wildfires with air pollution over Siberia, Alaska, and Canada in and around the Arctic in summer."

One high-profile scientific focus during such expeditions would be life detection, specifically the discovery of past or present
microbial life, if they exist. However, both humans and associated objects typically carry a high microbial burden. Thus, it is
essential to distinguish between microbes brought with the expedition and those present on the exploring planets. Modern
spacesuits are unique, customized spacecraft which provide protection, mobility and life support to crew during spacewalks, yet
they vent continuously, and the mobility of microbes through spacesuits has not been studied.
To evaluate the microbial colonization of spacesuits, NASA used an Extravehicular Activity swab kit to examine viable microbial
populations of 48 samples from spacesuits using both traditional microbiological methods and molecular sequencing methods. The
cultivable microbial population ranged from below the detection limit to 9 x 102 colony forming units per 25 cm2 of sample and
also significantly varied by the location. The cultivable microbial diversity was dominated by members of Bacillus, Arthrobacter,
and Ascomycota. However, 16S rRNA-based viable bacterial burden ranged from 105 to 106 copies per 25 cm2 of sample. Shotgun
metagenome sequencing revealed the presence of a diverse microbial population on the spacesuit surfaces, including
Curtobacterium and Methylobacterium from across all sets of spacesuits in high abundance. Among bacterial species identified,
higher abundance of Cutibacterium acnes, Methylobacterium oryzae, and M. phyllosphaerae reads were documented.
The results of this study provide evidence that identical microbial strains may live on the wrist joint, inner gauntlet, and outer
gauntlet of spacesuits. This raises the possibility, but does not confirm, that viable microbes are able to migrate between the
interior and exterior of spacesuits. Overall, these data provide the first estimate of microbial dispersion from internal to
external spacesuit surfaces, which will help future mission planners develop effective planetary protection strategies."

This paper is the first to explore the applicability of airport noise exposure maps to Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The FAA’s airport noise compatibility planning program is first described. Then the applicability of the noise exposure map to Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is explored. Finally, new airspace infrastructure, including vertiport locations and UAM routes from NASA’s UAM engineering simulations, and local noise-sensitive facility locations and land use information were collected and processed to develop the noise exposure maps of UAM near the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The DNL noise contours resulting from a six-passenger electric quadrotor prototype vehicle are predicted using NASA’s AIRNOISEUAM software. The noise exposure maps of UAM are generated automatically using Python’s data analysis and visualization libraries. The results have applications for UAM’s noise compatibility planning, noise-reducing route planning, and vertiport location selection.

The description with optimum predictive capability for a dataset generated by a physical system is one that minimizes both predictive error on the dataset and the complexity of the description.  The discovery of the governing physics of a system can therefore be viewed as a mathematical optimization problem.  We outline here a method to optimize the description of arbitrarily complex physical systems by minimizing the entropy of the description of the system.  The Recursive Domain Partitioning (RDP) procedure finds the optimum partitioning of each physical domain into subdomains, and the optimum predictive function within each subdomain.  Penalty functions are introduced to limit the complexity of the predictive function within each domain.  Examples are shown in 1D and 2D.  In 1D, the technique effectively discovers the elastic and plastic regions within a stress-strain curve generated by simulations of amorphous carbon material, while in 2D the technique discovers the free-flow region and the inertially-obstructed flow region in the simulation of fluid flow across a plate."

The derived IOPs include the total (a()), phytoplankton  (aphy()), and colored detrital matter (acdm()), absorption coefficients, and the total (bb()) and particulate (bbp()) backscattering coefficients. The first step uses an improved neural network approach to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance from Rrs. a() and bbp() are then estimated using the LS2 model (Loisel et al., 2018), which does not require spectral assumptions on IOPs and hence can assess a() and bb() at any wavelength at which Rrs() is measured. Then, an inverse optimization algorithm is combined with an optical water class (OWC) approach to assess aphy() and acdm() from anw().The proposed model is evaluated using an in situ dataset collected in open oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. Comparisons with other standard semi-analytical algorithms (QAA and GSM), as well as match-up exercises, have also been performed. The applicability of the algorithm on OLCI observations was assessed through the analysis of global IOPs spatial patterns derived from 3SAA and GSM. The good performance of 3SAA is manifested by median absolute percentage differences (MAPD) of 13%, 23%, 34% and 34% for bbp(443), anw(443), aphy(443) and acdm(443), respectively for oceanic waters. Due to the absence of spectral constraints on IOPs in the inversion of total IOPs, and the adoption of an OWC-based approach, the performance of 3SAA is only slightly degraded in bio-optical complex inland waters."

Public water systems serve drinking water to nearly 90% of the United States population. Cyanobacteria and their toxins may degrade the quality of finished drinking water and can lead to negative health consequences. Satellite imagery can serve as a cost-effective and consistent monitoring technique for surface cyanobacterial blooms in source waters and can provide drinking water treatment operators information for managing their systems. This study uses satellite imagery from the European Space Agency’s Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) spanning June 2016 through April 2020. At 300-m spatial resolution, OLCI imagery can be used to monitor cyanobacteria in 685 drinking water sources across 285 lakes in 44 states, referred to here as resolvable drinking water sources. First, a subset of satellite data was compared to a subset of responses (n = 84) submitted as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s fourth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 4). These UCMR 4 qualitative responses included visual observations of algal bloom presence and absence near drinking water intakes from March 2018 through November 2019. Overall agreement between satellite imagery and UCMR 4 qualitative responses was 94% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.70. Next, temporal frequency of cyanobacterial blooms at all resolvable drinking water sources was assessed. In 2019, bloom frequency averaged 2% and peaked at 100%, where 100% indicated a bloom was always present at the source waters when satellite imagery was available. Monthly cyanobacterial abundances were used to assess short-term trends across all resolvable drinking water sources and effect size was computed to provide insight on the number of years of data that must be obtained to increase confidence in an observed change. Generally, 2016-2020 was an insufficient time period for confidently observing changes at these source waters; on average, a decade of satellite imagery would be required for observed environmental trends to outweigh variability in the data. However, five source waters did demonstrate a sustained short-term trend, with one increasing in cyanobacterial abundance from June 2016 to April 2020 and four decreasing."

This fleet of vehicles will enable examination of the sensitivity of UAM vehicle designs to technology assumptions, identify key research and development needs for UAM aircraft, and provide the UAM community with reference vehicles that are publicly available and based upon known assumptions. To date, four six-passenger reference vehicles have been established: a quadrotor, a side-by-side, a lift-plus-cruise, and a quiet single main rotor helicopter; this paper adds a tiltwing vehicle to the fleet.

This paper details the design process that was followed in order to establish the tiltwing vehicle in the fleet, including early conceptual design decisions, sizing and configuration trades, structural analyses, proprotor design and aeroacoustic predictions, and aerodynamic analyses. The resulting tiltwing vehicle uses a turboelectric propulsion system to power six proprotors positioned on a tilting main wing and two tilting proprotors positioned on the horizontal tail. This paper also compares the resulting tiltwing vehicle with the other six-passenger reference vehicles, including an updated lift-plus-cruise vehicle, and then proposes future studies. The fleet of UAM reference vehicles will continue to evolve; subsequent versions of the reference vehicles will be based upon the results of future trade studies and technology developments."

New observations, incorporated into models via assimilation or calibration, hold the promise of improved forecast skill, but erroneous model coupling can hinder the benefits of such activities. To better understand model representation of coupled interactions and feedbacks, this study demonstrates a novel framework for coupled calibration of the Single Column Model (SCM) capability of the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) system coupled to NASA’s Land Information System (LIS). The local land-atmosphere coupling (LoCo) process chain paradigm is used to assess the processes and connections revealed by calibration experiments. Two summer case studies in the U. S. Southern Great Plains are simulated in which LSM parameters are calibrated to diurnal observations of LoCo process chain components including 2-meter temperature, 2-meter humidity, surface fluxes (Bowen ratio), and PBL height. Results show a wide range of soil moisture and hydraulic parameter solutions depending on which L-A variable (i.e. observation) is used for calibration, highlighting that improvement in either SHP or ISM when not in tandem with the other can provide undesirable results. Overall, this work demonstrates that a process chain calibration approach can be used to assess L-A connections, feedbacks, strengths, and deficiencies in coupled models, as well as quantify the potential impact of new sources of observations of land-PBL variables on coupled prediction."

We utilize the existing measurements to compare the long-term ozone changes that occurred within the marine boundary layer at northern and southern midlatitudes. Since 1950 ozone concentrations have increased by a factor of 2.1 ± 0.2 in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and are presently larger than in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), where only a much smaller increase has occurred. These changes are attributed to increased ozone production driven by anthropogenic emissions of photochemical ozone precursors that increased with industrial development. The greater ozone concentrations and increases in the NH are consistent with the predominant location of anthropogenic emission sources in that hemisphere. The available measurements indicate that this interhemispheric gradient was much smaller and was likely reversed in the pre-industrial troposphere with higher concentrations in the SH. Six Earth system model (ESM) simulations indicate similar total NH increases (1.9 with a standard deviation of 0.3), but they occurred more slowly over a longer time period, and the ESMs do not find higher pre-industrial ozone in the SH. Several uncertainties in the ESMs may cause these model–measurement disagreements: the assumed natural nitrogen oxide emissions may be too large, the relatively greater fraction of ozone injected by stratosphere–troposphere exchange to the NH may be overestimated, ozone surface deposition to ocean and land surfaces may not be accurately simulated, and model treatment of emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons and their photochemistry may not be adequate."

To understand the convective cloud development process, this study investigates the impact of aerosols on convective clouds by considering the influence of both topography and diurnal variation of radiation.  By combining texture analysis, clustering and thresholding methods, we identify all convective clouds in two warm seasons (May-September, 2016-2017) in eastern China based on Himawari-8 Level 1 data. Having a large diurnally resolved cloud data together with surface meteorological and environmental measurements, we investigate convective cloud properties and their variation, stratified by elevation and diurnal change. We then analyze the potential impact of aerosol on convective clouds under different meteorological conditions and topographies. In general, convective clouds tend to occur preferentially under polluted conditions in the morning, which reverses in the afternoon. Convective cloud fraction first increases then decreases with aerosol loading, which may contribute to this phenomenon. Topography and diurnal meteorological variations may affect the strength of aerosol microphysical and radiative effects. Updraft is always stronger along the windward slopes of mountains and plateaus, especially in northern China. The prevailing southerly wind near the foothills of mountains and plateaus is likely to contribute to this windward strengthening of updraft and to bring more pollutant into the mountains, thereby strengthening the microphysical effect, invigorating convective clouds. By comparison, over plain, aerosols decrease surface heating and suppresses convection by blocking solar radiation reaching the surface."

This is accomplished by analyzing discernable shifts in measurement parameters acquired from the engine. This paper reviews the founding mathematical principles of gas path analysis, including conventional approaches applied for estimating engine performance deterioration. Considerations for extending the application of gas path analysis techniques to Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) systems is also discussed, and simulated results from their application to an EAP concept comprised of turbomachinery and electrical system hardware is provided. Results are provided comparing the parameter estimation accuracy offered by taking a whole-system approach towards the problem setup versus that offered by analyzing each subsystem individually. For the latter, the importance of having accurate direct or inferred measurements of external mechanical torque loads placed upon turbomachinery shafts is emphasized."

These X-rays are modified by a complex distribution of absorbers in the pre-shock region. The presence of photo-ionized lines and warm absorber features in the soft X-ray spectra of these mCVs suggests that these absorbers are ionized. We developed the ionized complex absorber model zxipab, which is represented by a power-law distribution of ionized absorbers in the pre-shock  ow. Using the ionized absorber model zxipab along with a cooling  ow model and a reflection component, we model the broadband Chandra/HETG and NuSTAR spectra of two IPs: NY Lup and V1223 Sgr. We  nd that this model describes well many of the H and He like emission lines from medium Z elements, which arises from the collisionally excited plasma. However the model fails to account for some of the He like triplets from medium Z elements, which points towards its photo-ionization origin. We do not  find a compelling evidence for a blackbody component to model the soft excess seen in the residuals of the Chandra/HETG spectra, which could be due to the uncertainties in estimation of the interstellar absorption of these sources using Chandra/HETG data and/or excess  fluxes seen in some photo-ionized emission lines which are not accounted by the cooling  ow model. We describe the implications of this model with respect to the geometry of the pre-shock region in these two IPs"

Aerosol lidar, a ground-based remote sensing method, provides the vertical distribution of aerosol at a high temporal resolution observation data, from which, the PBL structure and the position of the PBL top can be comprehensively studied. PBLH determination with lidar data depends primarily on the characteristic turbulent motions in the atmosphere and the geophysical location. However, lidar determination of PBLH over densely populated subtropical locations has rarely been discussed; thus, developing retrieval techniques suitable to these areas is necessary. In this study, four PBLH determination methods (Gradient, δ–threshold, Haar wavelet transform, and hybrid image processing) are applied to estimate the PBLH from lidar observations over an urban area in East Asia, and one—the Gradient method—relied on potential temperature measurements from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights to validate our results. Our results indicate that a combination of the gradient method and δ-threshold method can provide better results, in terms of diurnal pattern, than using either method individually. Furthermore, the Haar wavelet and the Hybrid image processing can detect the PBL development comparably well, but both methods are dependent on their initial conditions and optimized algorithm settings. In addition, the accompanying UAV observations are conclusively shown to have a high degree of efficacy for validating the lidar data. This research highlights that a combination of PBLH determination methods can better describe the PBLH evolution throughout a day in some cases, while in others less common determination methods are proving useful, and a suite of retrieval methods should still be explored for precisely mapping the PBL in densely populated subtropical areas."

The simultaneous operation of these two satellite altimeters enables unique comparison studies of sea ice altimetry, utilizing the different frequencies and profiling strategies of the two instruments. Here, we use freeboard data from ICESat-2 to assess Antarctic snow freeboard retrievals from CryoSat-2. We first discuss updates made to a previously published CryoSat-2 retrieval process and show how this Version 2 algorithm improves upon the original method by comparing the new retrievals to ICESat-2 in specific along-track profiles as well as on the basin-scale. In two near-coincident along-track profiles, we find mean snow freeboard differences (standard deviations of differences) of 0.3 (9.3) and 7.6 cm (9.6 cm) with 25 km binned correlation coefficients of 0.77 and 0.89. Monthly mean freeboard differences range between −2.9 (10.8) and 6.6 cm (16.8 cm) basin wide, with the largest differences typically occurring in Austral fall months that is hypothesized to be related to new ice growth and the use of static snow backscatter coefficients in the retrieval. Monthly mean correlation coefficients range between 0.57 and 0.80. While coincident data show good agreement between the two sensors, they highlight issues related to geometric and frequency sampling differences that can impact the freeboard distributions."

During two flights on 9 and 18 June 2018, the NASA airborne 4STAR (Spectrometers for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research) Sun photometer registered high fine-mode (FM, <1 µm) in-plume AODs of up to 0.4 and 0.9, respectively, in the vicinity of the plume source (<20 km). Particle composition shows that the plumes were associated with elevated concentrations of sulfates and ammonium. These high AODs significantly exceed climatological averages for June and were not captured by the nearby AERONET instrument (mean daily AODs of 0.10±0.01 and 0.07±0.02, maximum AOD of 0.12) due possibly to horizontal inhomogeneity of the plumes, plume dilution and winds which in certain cases were carrying the plume away from the ground-based instrument. The average 4STAR out-of-plume (background) AODs deviated only marginally from AERONET daily averaged values. While 4STAR AOD peaks were generally well correlated in time with peaks in the in situ-measured particle concentrations, we show that differences in particle size are the dominant factor in determining the 4STAR-derived AOD. During the two flights of 24 June and 5 July 2018 when plumes likely travelled distances of 60 km or more, the average 4STAR FM AOD increased by 0.01–0.02 over ∼50 km of downwind particle evolution, which was supported by the increases in layer AODs calculated from the in situ extinction measurements. Based on these observations as well as the increases in organic mass, we attribute the observed AOD increase, at least in part, to secondary organic aerosol formation. The in-plume and out-of-plume AODs for this second pair of flights, in contrast to clear differences in in situ optical and other measurements, were practically indistinguishable and compared favourably to AERONET within 0.01–0.02 AOD. This means that AERONET was generally successful in capturing the background AODs, but missed some of the spatially constrained high-AOD plumes with sources as close as 30–50 km, which is important to note since the AERONET measurements are generally thought to be representative of the regional AOD loading. The fact that industrial plumes can be associated with significantly higher AODs in the vicinity of the emission sources than previously reported from AERONET can potentially have an effect on estimating the AOSR radiative impact."

The study area covered subbasins of the western Barataria Basin near the Bayou Lafourche in southeastern Louisiana. Bayou Lafourche's estuaries have seen some of the highest rates of wetland conversion to open water of any coastal zone in the United States. The Landsat Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used in this study to map changes in land/water fractions at a 30-m pixel resolution between October 2005 (post-Katrina) and October 2018. Validation boat surveys were conducted in July 2020 to visually verify the presence or absence of (>1 m) emergent vegetation growing on marshlands across several subbasins, with photographs collected at more than 150 target locations along the route. Based on NDWI change, a total of 42.3 km2 was estimated to fall into the category of wetland loss since 2005. The leading subbasins for these recent wetland-to-water conversions made up most of the southwestern portion of the study area just north of Port Fourchon. The consistently low distance detected between the majority of wetland loss cells and locations of historical oil and gas wells implies that effects of well drilling and extraction have had a continuing negative impact on marshland degradation in the basin. Conversely, a total of 34 km2 was estimated to fall into the category of recent wetland gain, with much of the new vegetation growth verified to have been restored within several shoreline protection and dredging projects. It was concluded that the positive contributions made by such shoreline enhancement and marshland nourishment projects in Lafourche Parish to offset wetland losses over the past 15 years should not be underestimated."

However, growing crops outside of Earth’s orbit creates many new challenges. The KCS SCP Project Scientists have developed a method of organizing these challenges, called the Gaps List. This Gaps List is a dynamic, taxonomically arranged list of missing knowledge and technologies needed to reach production  goals. The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the effectiveness and current research coverage of the Gaps List by using it to document the KSC SCP Program research. In evaluating the research, it was determined  that several needs within the SCP Program that are not being met, and many deficiencies within the Gaps List were encountered. Gaps involving hardware were largely unrecognized by the KSC researchers and the funding sources that would typically support them. The KSC SCP Project will require more engineering and physical sciences support to close those gaps. The Gaps List was found to be out of date and in need of rearrangement. A recommendation from this review was that the Gaps List be reassessed at regular intervals to ensure all gaps and relevant research topics are included. In order to better understand the gaps within the list, any assessment needs to include a measure of priority, dependency and breadth. These measures may be included within or along side the current taxonomical arrangement of the Gaps List."

A global Landslide Hazard Assessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model provides routine near-real time estimates of landslide hazard using Integrated Multi-Satellite Precipitation Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Mission (IMERG). However, it does not provide information on potential landslide hazard in the future. Forecasting potential landslide events at a global scale presents an area of open research. This study compares a global precipitation forecast provided by NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) with near-real time satellite precipitation estimates. The Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor gauge corrected (MRMS-GC) reference is used to assess the performance of both satellite and model-based precipitation products over the contiguous United States (CONUS). The forecast lead time of 24hrs is considered, with a focus on extreme precipitation events. The performance of IMERG and GEOS-Forecast products is assessed in terms of the probability of detection, success ratio, critical success index and hit bias as well as continuous statistics. The results show that seasonality influences the performance of both satellite and model-based precipitation products. Comparison of IMERG and GEOS-Forecast globally as well as in several event case studies (Colombia, southeast Asia, and Tajikistan) reveals that GEOS-Forecast detects extreme rainfall more frequently relative to IMERG for these specific analyses. For recent landslide points across the globe, the 24hr accumulated precipitation forecast >100 mm corresponds well with near-real time daily accumulated IMERG precipitation estimates. GEOS-Forecast and IMERG precipitation match more closely for tropical cyclones than for other types of storms. The main intention of this study is to assess the viability of using a global forecast for landslide predictions and understand the extent of the variability between these products to inform where we would expect the landslide modeling results to most prominently diverge. Results of this study will be used to inform how forecasted precipitation estimates can be incorporated into the LHASA model to provide the first global predictive view of landslide hazards."

This testing is governed by ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials) E1921 standard.  The calculations and plots required by this standard are iterative in nature and require significant effort to produce by standard hand calculations.  In addition to analysis of a complete data set, intermediate analysis during testing is beneficial to determine optimal test temperatures.  Given the exhaustive nature of calculating the transition temperature, being able to quickly update target temperatures is a significant benefit to not only the quality of tests, but the number of required tests as well.  T0 Test Evaluation Module (T0TEM) v1.5 is a software application created under the Layered Pressure Vessel (LPV) certification effort.  To reduce the analysis time of transition temperature test data sets producedfor this effort, T0TEM was created to calculate the E1921 Master Curve along with all required data and validity checks.  By creating this program, hundreds of hours of analysis time were saved.  In addition, the creation of a standard program provided a significant improvement in the consistency with which results were reported.  T0TEM also calculates the results and plots required for the E1921 inhomogeneity annex to determine whether a material behaves in a homogenous manner.  This program was created by Levi Shelton and Cameron Bosley at NASA, with input and review from the E1921 committee.  The results generated by T0TEM were compared to the validation data sets provided by ASTM with good concurrence.  ASTM committee members have reviewed and applied T0TEM to other data sets with satisfactory results.  T0TEM was originally released to the NASA Software Repository and publicly via SourceForge in May of 2020.  Version 1.5 was released in April of 2021 with minor functionality updates and additional statistical analysis methods."

During this perihelion time, impulsive reversals in the magnetic field, called ""switchbacks,"" were found in the data set characterized by a quick rotation in B along with a simultaneous increase in solar wind flow. In this work, we examine the structure and morphology of 920 switchback boundaries as PSP enters and exits the structures, specifically looking for evidence of boundary degradation, dissipation, and associated ultralow frequency (ULF) magnetic wave activity. We find that boundaries with the most abrupt, step-function-like change in Br and Vr also show little evidence of dissipation and ULF wave activity. In contrast, there is a set of boundaries that appears highly degraded with ULF magnetic activity in the vicinity of the boundary. We thus infer that the steep, step-like boundaries with little ULF activity are relatively young in comparison to the degraded boundaries. The distribution in relative ages suggests that the switchback boundary formation process is dynamic and evolving, even occurring near the PSP observation point inside of 40 Rs."

This species lives year-round in the southeastern U.S., but individuals from the northeastern U.S. migrate south in the winter and overlap with southeastern residents. The Eastern Towhee is one of the fastest-declining bird species in the eastern U.S. In this study, we compare Eastern Towhee population trends during the breeding season with winter population trends over the last three decades. Paradoxically, this species is significantly increasing in Maryland, West Virginia, New Jersey, Virginia, and Delaware during the winter, but decreasing during the summer. Using the national Breeding Bird Survey dataset, we show that the Eastern Towhee populations have been declining roughly at a rate of -11.58% in Maryland, -9.51% in West Virginia, -37.95% in New Jersey, -11.22% in Virginia, and -16.96% in Delaware per year from 1984-2015. But the populations have been increasing during winter roughly at a rate of 0.62% in Maryland, 0.05% in West Virginia, 0.33% in New Jersey, 0.08% in Virginia, and 0.51% in Delaware per year from 1984-2019, using the Christmas Bird Count. We explore a variety of hypotheses to explain this paradox, including a northward range shift in association with climate change, as well as changes in habitat availability. Our study documents how the natural world is changing in complex ways due to many stressors and will help understand how to conserve the Eastern Towhee."

In the flight path over Vancouver Island on 8 August 2017, the column XCO2 retrievals from the lidar measurements at flight altitudes around 9 km showed an average enhancement of 4 ppm from the wildfires. A comparison of these enhancements with those from the Goddard Global Chemistry Transport model suggested that the modeled CO2 emissions from wildfires were underestimated by more than a factor of 2. A spiral-down validation performed at Moses Lake airport, Washington showed a bias of 0.1 ppm relative to in situ measurements and a standard deviation of 1 ppm in lidar XCO2 retrievals. The results show that future airborne campaigns and spaceborne missions with this type of lidar can improve estimates of CO2 emissions from wildfires and estimates of carbon fluxes globally."

Over this period, the power density spectrum showed a stable morphology, with broad ∼ 25% rms band-limited noise below 16 Hz. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) were occasionally observed, with the most notably detections including a low-frequency QPO centered at 2.7 Hz and a sharp QPO centered at 115 Hz that may be a 2:3 resonance with the spin frequency. Further, the energy dependence of the band-limited noise is studied through a spectroscopic analysis of the complex covariance in two frequency intervals. It is found that the power law continuum is the primary driver for the observed variability, although the thermal (blackbody) emission also appears to be intrinsically variable in area (5% rms) and temperature (1% rms). Notably, the 1 keV emission feature seen in all X-ray spectra of IGR J17062–6143 varies with the same amplitude as the power law, but systematically lags behind that continuum emission. These results appear consistent with a scenario in which a time variable Compton-scattering corona is the primary source for the observed stochastic variability, with the variability observed in the emission feature and at the lowest photon energies being due to the disk reflection of the power law continuum."

As spring SI has decreased, summer OW, summer warmth, MaxNDVI, and TI-NDVI have increased. However, the initial very strong upward trends in previous studies for MaxNDVI and TI-NDVI are weakening and becoming spatially and temporally more variable as the ice retreats from the coastal areas. TI-NDVI has declined over the last decade particularly over High Arctic regions and southwest Alaska. The continentality index (CI) (maximum minus minimum monthly temperatures) is decreasing across the tundra, more so over North America than Eurasia. The relationship has weakened between SI and SWI and TI-NDVI, as the maritime influence of OW has increased along with total precipitation. The winter AD is correlated in Eurasia with spring SI, summer OW, MaxNDVI, TI-NDVI, the CI and total summer precipitation. This winter connection to tundra emphasizes the role of SI in driving the summer indicators. The winter (DJF) AD drives SI variations which in turn shape summer OW, the atmospheric SWI and NDVI anomalies. The winter and spring indicators represent potential predictors of tundra vegetation productivity a season or two in advance of the growing season."

A case of strong NUBF errors was identified in ER-2 X-band Radar (EXRAD) data from the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) 2020 field campaign. A basic NUBF correction was employed using an estimate of the along-track radar reflectivity gradient. The relationship is verified empirically using co-located Doppler velocity measurements from the higher resolution Cloud Radar System (CRS).

Ecologists have beenusing Habitat Suitability Models (HSMs) for more than four decades to study the habitability of Earth fromlocal to global scales. Astrobiologists have been proposing different habitability models for some time, with lit-tle integration and consistency among them, being different in function to those used by ecologists. Habitabilitymodels are not only used to determine whether environments are habitable, but they also are used to charac-terize what key factors are responsible for the gradual transition from low to high habitability states. Here wereview and compare some of the different models used by ecologists and astrobiologists and suggest how theycould be integrated into new habitability standards. Such standards will help improve the comparison and charac-terization of potentially habitable environments, prioritize target selections, and study correlations between habit-ability and biosignatures. Habitability models are the foundation of planetary habitability science, and the synergybetween ecologists and astrobiologists is necessary to expand our understanding of the habitability of Earth,the Solar System, and extrasolar planets."

Increasingly, ignitions are controlled by human activities either through suppression of wildfires or intentional ignition of prescribed fires. The Southeastern United States leads the nation in prescribed fire, burning ca. 80% of the countries extent annually. The COVID-19 pandemic radically changed human behavior as workplaces implemented social-distancing guidelines and provided an opportunity to evaluate relationships between humans and fire as fire management plans were postponed or cancelled. Using active fire data from satellite-based observations, we found that in the Southeastern United States, COVID-19 led to a 21% reduction in fire activity compared to the 2003-2019 average. The reduction was more pronounced for federally managed lands, up to 41% below average compared to the past 20-years (38% below average compared to the past decade). Declines in fire activity were partly affected by an unusually wet February before the COVID-19 shutdown began in mid-March 2020. Despite the wet spring, the predicted number of active fire detections was still lower than expected, confirming a COVID-19 signal on ignitions. In addition, prescribed fire management statistics, reported by US federal agencies, confirmed the satellite observations, and showed that following the wet February and before the mid-March COVID-19 shutdown, cumulative burned area was approaching record highs across the region. With fire return intervals in the Southeastern United States as frequent as 1-2 years, COVID-19 fire impacts will contribute to an increasing backlog in necessary fire management activities, affecting biodiversity and future fire danger."

These reservoirs are part of the larger Highland Lakes chain, managed by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and the City of Austin Department of Watershed Protection (CoA DWP), which fulfill municipal, commercial, and agricultural water demands. Given the recent increase in favorable algal event conditions in central Texas, the LCRA and CoA DWP partnered with NASA DEVELOP to improve algal event early-warning systems through the application of remote sensing and machine learning. An Earth observation-based algal monitoring system will assist the responsible agencies in predicting algal conditions and communicating hazards to the public. The NASA DEVELOP team utilized Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data to produce products including chlorophyll-a concentrations, cyanobacteria detections, turbidity, and water surface temperature. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were retrieved with a pre-trained machine learning model (mixture density network) and spectral indices, while the other products were derived from spectral indices. In situ field data were used to validate and quantify uncertainties for each product. The validations show strong correlations for chlorophyll-a and water surface temperature. Time series analyses of chlorophyll-a concentrations show peaks in the severe drought years (2015 and 2016). This project's resulting products enable monitoring of environmental proxies relevant to algal event presence in the Highland Lakes chain and will ultimately support water management, decision making, and risk communication."

Healthy wetland networks offer protection from severe weather, reduce flooding, improve water quality, and provide opportunities for education and recreation. However, human activities in combination with natural events, continue to cause substantial loss of wetland cover and damage wetland health. Over the last thirty years, the state of Delaware has experienced a net loss of roughly 5,000 acres of wetland. In collaboration with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC), the team used NASA Earth observations including Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals (GPM IMERG) to develop a methodology to monitor recent changes in wetland cover and forecast landward marsh migration due to sea-level rise, changes to climate, and human development. Trend analysis of current and past climate conditions in precipitation and temperature revealed an overall increase in both metrics. Using Land Change Modeler in TerrSet and Suitability Modeler in ArcGIS Pro, the team visualized landcover shifts over the last 20 years, indicating a general pattern of net wetland loss and identified locations where marsh migration could potentially occur in the future. These observations will enable better planning for restoration activities and in form decision-making to preserve wetland health and ecosystem functions."

This decline in land area has damaged important bird habitat and reduced the islands’ ability to protect coastal Louisiana from storm surges. The persistence of the islands is synergetic to that of the surrounding seagrass beds; seagrass binds together land, protecting the islands from erosion, and the loss of land exposes the seagrass and accelerates its decline. Furthermore, seagrass is independently important, absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for marine ecosystems. Here we present the Tool for Coastal Remote Ecological Observations in Louisiana (Tool CREOL), a Google Earth Engine Tool built to easily access data from Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Aqua and Terra MODIS. We show, using time series and maps generated using the tool, how land area and seagrass have responded to destructive events from the past 36 years (1984-2021). In only 7 years, Hurricane Georges (1998), Ivan (2004), and Katrina (2005) reduced land area by approximately 85%, accompanied by a major decline in seagrass extent. Tool CREOL will have strategic utility in planning upcoming restoration and revegetation efforts planned by Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority in the Breton National Wildlife Refuge and will provide up-to-date monitoring of the results of that project. The tool serves as a basic model which can be adapted to study similar coastal regions in the world."

However, infrastructure development disrupted the natural sediment transport processes of the barrier island, which accelerated erosion of the island’s shoreline. To counteract this, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated semiannual sediment bypassing operations in 2004. Over time, financial constraints limited the amount of sediment deposition possible, leading to concerns over navigational issues in nearby channels and the possibility of the operations not providing their intended benefits. To address these issues, NASA DEVELOP partnered with the National Park Service NPS and USACE. The team performed time series analyses of nearshore suspended sediment from 2004-2020 and landcover change from 2006-2018 with satellite imagery from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). The sediment transport analyses showed that suspended sediment levels are seasonally dependent. Meanwhile, historical land cover trends included a net increase in unconsolidated shore and a net decrease in open water. Land cover change was then forecast to 2021, 2031, and 2046 using the IDRISI TerrSet Land Change Modeler. The model predicted the most drastic land cover changes in the southern portion and the least on the eastern foreshore of the island. As a result, this project allows our partners to understand the impact of sediment bypassing operations more fully and make better-informed decisions regarding the island’s management."

California’s Marine Life Protection Act protects such ecosystems by creating Marine Protected Areas. California has approximately 440,000 acres of estuarine habitats as well as 23 Estuarine Marine Protected Areas (EMPAs); thus, in situ data collection is often difficult due to time and resource constraints. This project used remote sensing to gather data that examined the health and dynamics of California EMPAs in order to supplement ground-based field measurements. Through the use of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-SAR), this project assessed mouth state, inundation extent, turbidity, temperature, and tidal measurements for observable estuaries. The Normalized Water Difference Index from Sentinel-2 MSI captured estuary mouth state and inundation extent. Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI detected differences in water quality metrics that correlated to changes in estuary mouth state (i.e., open or closed). The team’s California Estuary Assessment (CEA) tool in Google Earth Engine was successful in analyzing estuary mouth state, inundation, and water quality. It was most effective when breach events were larger than 10 meters in resolution, water surface was smooth, and imagery was unimpeded by algae or sun glint. The CEA tool will allow the partners, the Ocean Protection Council, Central Coast Wetlands Group, Southern California Coastal Water Research Project, and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and Davis (UCD), to better understand estuary dynamics and more effectively conduct in situ estuary monitoring."

People in urbanized areas experience higher temperatures than rural areas due to diminished vegetation and increased impervious surfaces which absorb and radiate heat. Fairfax County, Virginia has embarked on Resilient Fairfax, a program aimed at addressing climate adaptation and resilience. The DEVELOP team partnered with the Fairfax County Office of Environmental and Energy Coordination (OEEC) to assess the extent of the urban heat island effect on the county and its most vulnerable populations. The team used data from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), as well as the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) for the years 2013 to 2021 and found that the hottest spots were in densely urbanized areas, with temperatures as much as 47°F above that of undeveloped reference areas. The team used the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) urban cooling model and determined that areas with higher tree canopy cover had greater heat mitigation capacity. Estimates from the InVEST model showed that a 4.5% increase in canopy cover across the county could result in a temperature reduction of up to 2.4°F in some areas. The results will allow partners to assess heat distribution across Fairfax County and implement effective mitigation strategies, including locating prime locations for cooling centers and increasing canopy cover."

The NASA N+3 technology level reference propulsion system model, an advanced, single-aisle class, gas turbine engine was the baseline cycle. The amount of thermal energy removed from the high-energy core flow and transferred to lower-energy bypass or removed from the cycle was varied. Total pressure losses were included parametrically, as well as the effects of converting some of that thermal energy to work used within the cycle. Propulsion system thrust and thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) were minimally affected by total pressure losses or thermal energy removal from the core stream. However, total pressure losses in the bypass stream had significant thrust and TSFC penalties. Those penalties were partially offset if core thermal energy is transferred to the bypass stream.  Core thermal energy converted to work for use within the engine cycle via a bottoming cycle showed significant thrust and TSFC benefits. In addition to these results, an engine dataset is also being made available. The dataset contains engine conditions (mass flow rate, total temperature and pressure, flow velocities, etc.) at four flight conditions (maximum climb limit, cruise, rolling takeoff and sea level static) that can be used for specific information to guide heat exchanger design to best realize these benefits with further research. The data set is a .csv (comma-separated values) file and is provided as a supplement to this report (available online from www.sti.nasa.gov)."

While the behavior of these models is well understood and they allow for a comparison of different sources and studying source behavior, the extent to which the underlying physics can be derived from the model parameters is very limited. During recent years, several physically motivated spectral models have been developed to overcome these limitations. Their application, however, is generally computationally much more expensive and they require a high number of parameters which are difficult to constrain. In particular, Becker & Wolff(2007) presented an analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation inside the accretion column assuming a velocity profile that is linear in the optical depth. An implementation of this model that is both fast and accurate enough to be fitted to observed spectra is available in XSPEC. The main difficulty of this implementation is that some solutions violate energy conservation and therefore have to be rejected by the user. We propose a novel fitting strategy that ensures energy conservation during theχ2-minimization which simplifies the application of the model considerably. We demonstrate this approach as well as a study of possible parameter degeneracies with a comprehensive Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the complete parameter space for a combined NuSTAR and Swift/XRT data-set of Cen X-3.The derived accretion-flow structure features a small column radius of∼63 m and a spectrum dominated by bulk-Comptonization of bremsstrahlung seed photons, in agreement with previous studies"

This bold mission of exploration would orbit an ice-giant planet to study the planet, its rings, small satellites, space environment, and the planet-sized moon Triton. Triton is a captured dwarf planet from the Kuiper Belt, twin of Pluto, and likely ocean world. Odyssey addresses Neptune system-level science, with equal priorities placed on Neptune, its rings, moons, space environment, and Triton. Between Uranus and Neptune, the latter is unique in providing simultaneous access to both an ice giant and a Kuiper Belt dwarf planet. The spacecraft—in a class equivalent to the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini spacecraft—would launch by 2031 on a Space Launch System or equivalent launch vehicle and utilize a Jupiter gravity assist for a 12 yr cruise to Neptune and a 4 yr prime orbital mission; alternatively a launch after 2031 would have a 16 yr direct-to-Neptune cruise phase. Our solution provides annual launch opportunities and allows for an easy upgrade to the shorter (12 yr) cruise. Odyssey would orbit Neptune retrograde (prograde with respect to Triton), using the moonʼs gravity to shape the orbital tour and allow coverage of Triton, Neptune, and the space environment. The atmospheric entry probe would descend in ∼37 minutes to the 10 bar pressure level in Neptune’s atmosphere just before Odysseyʼs orbit-insertion engine burn. Odysseyʼs mission would end by conducting a Cassini-like “Grand Finale,” passing inside the rings and ultimately taking a final great plunge into Neptuneʼs atmosphere."

Investing in flood adaptation strategies may reduce the loss of life and livelihood caused by floods. Where and how floods occur and who is exposed are changing as a result of rapid urbanization4, flood mitigation infrastructure and increasing settlements in floodplains6. Previous estimates of the global flood-exposed population have been limited by a lack of observational data, relying instead on models, which have high uncertainty. Here we use daily satellite imagery at 250-metre resolution to estimate flood extent and population exposure for 913 large flood events from 2000 to 2018. We determine a total inundation area of 2.23 million square kilometres, with 255–290 million people directly affected by floods. We estimate that the total population in locations with satellite-observed inundation grew by 58–86 million from 2000 to 2015. This represents an increase of 20 to 24 per cent in the proportion of the global population exposed to floods, ten times higher than previous estimates. Climate change projections for 2030 indicate that the proportion of the population exposed to floods will increase further. The high spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite observations will improve our understanding of where floods are changing and how best to adapt. The global flood database generated from these observations will help to improve vulnerability assessments, the accuracy of global and local flood models, the efficacy of adaptation interventions and our understanding of the interactions between landcover change, climate and floods."

ATL03 provides time-tagged, geolocated photon heights referenced to the ellipsoid and a parameter providing an initial classification of photon events as signal or background. We use this classification to evaluate ATLAS radiometry (number of signal photons per transmitted laser pulse) over short time scales and over the mission to date. The radiometric performance of ATLAS will in part determine what differences in the signal and background photon rates are significant and indicate geophysical, rather than instrumental, changes. We find the ATLAS radiometry is very stable over short time scales and exhibits a long-term decrease of ∼1 signal photon per laser pulse (∼-12%) in the strong spots over the first 1.5 years of the mission."

Most fire safety hazards originate in or eventually involve solid fuels, whether they be cellulosic (e.g., cotton fabric), hydrocarbons (e.g., plastics) or high-energy density electrode materials (e.g., batteries). A key approach to ensuring safety has been to focus on reducing the potential flammability of these materials – achieved by limiting their ignitability, potential for flame spread, and ultimate heat-release potential if ignited [1-3]. This approach has been relatively effective despite several close calls [4].  The limits of our understanding, however, are continually being challenged as future spaceflight missions incorporate partial gravity, enhanced oxygen, new types and classes of materials (e.g., composites), and higher energy-density batteries. This presents both an exciting scientific opportunity to enhance our understanding of solid fuel combustion processes while also posing a dire threat to future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars."

Thus, accurate and timely information on wheat production can help mitigate food price fluctuations. Within the existing operational regional and global scale agricultural monitoring systems that provide information on global crop yield and area forecasts, there are still fundamental gaps: #1. Lack of quantitative Earth Observation (EO) derived crop information, #2. Lack of global but detailed (national or subnational level) and timely crop production forecasts and #3. Lack of information on forecast uncertainties. In this study we present the Agriculture Remotely-sensed Yield Algorithm (ARYA) an EO-based method, advancing the state of EO data application and usage (addressing gap #1) to forecast wheat yield. The algorithm is based on the evolution of the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) using MODIS data at 1km resolution and the Growing Degree Days (GDD) from reanalysis data. Additionally, we explore how Land Surface Temperature (LST) can be included into the model and whether this parameter adds any value to the model performance when combined with the optical information. ARYA is implemented at the national and subnational level to forecast winter wheat yield in the main wheat exporting countries of US, Russia, Ukraine, France, Germany, Australia and Argentina from 2001 to 2019 (covering over 70% of wheat exports globally) in a timely manner by providing daily forecasts (addressing gap #2). The results show that ARYA provides yield estimations with RMSE’s within 0.3 ± 0.1 t/ha at national level and 0.6 ± 0,1 t/ha at subnational level after Day Of the Year (DOY) 140 (mid May) in the Northern Hemisphere and DOY 280 (beginning of October) in the Southern Hemisphere. This means that ARYA can provide crop yield estimates of wheat yield with 5-15 % error at national and 7-20 % error at subnational level starting from 2 to 2.5 months prior to harvest."

We use the NASA Hydrological Forecast and Analysis System (NHyFAS) to investigate TWS forecast skill over Africa and assess its value for predicting vegetation activity from satellite estimates of leaf area index (LAI). Forecast skill is high over East and Southern Africa, extending up to 3–6 months in some cases, with more modest skill over West Africa. Highest skill generally occurs during the dry season or beginning of the wet season when TWS anomalies from the previous wet season are most likely to carry forward in time. In East Africa, this occurs prior to and during the transition into the spring “Long Rains” from January–March, while in Southern Africa this period of highest skill starts at the beginning of the dry season in April and extends through to the start of the wet season in October. TWS is highly and positively correlated with LAI, and a logistic regression model shows high cross-validation skill in predicting above or below normal LAI using TWS. Combining the LAI regression model with the NHyFAS forecasts, 1-month lead LAI predictions have high accuracy over East and Southern Africa, with reduced but significant skill at 3-month leads over smaller sub-regions. This highlights the potential value of TWS as an additional source of information for seasonal forecasts over Africa, with direct applications to some of the most vulnerable agricultural regions on the continent."

Because extratropical cyclone genesis often occurs at low-latitude, CYGNSS surface latent and sensible heat flux retrievals are composited to provide a mean picture of their spatial distribution in low-latitude oceanic extratropical cyclones. CYGNSSn heat fluxes are not affected by heavy precipitation and offer observations of storms with frequent revisit times. Consistent with prior results obtained for cyclones in the Gulf Stream region, the fluxes are strongest in the wake of the cold fronts, and weakest to negative in the warm sector in advance of the cold fronts. As cyclone strength increases, or mean precipitable water decreases, the maximum in surface heat fluxes increases while the minimum decreases. This impacts the changes in fluxes during cyclone intensification: the post-cold frontal surface heat flux maximum increases due to the increase in near surface winds. During cyclone dissipation, the fluxes in this sector decrease, due to the decrease in winds and in temperature and humidity contrast. The warm sector minimum decreases throughout the entire cyclone lifetime and is mostly driven by sea-air temperature and humidity contrast changes. However, during cyclone dissipation, the surface heat fluxes increase along the cold front in a narrow band to the east, independently from changes in the cyclone characteristics. This suggests that, during cyclone dissipation, energy transfers from the ocean to the atmosphere are linked to frontal in addition to synoptic-scale processes."

Recently, the investigation of H2-CO2 collision-induced absorption has opened up a new avenue to warm Noachian Mars.  We usethe ROCKE-3D global climate model to simulate plausible states of the ancient Martian climatewith this absorptive warming and reasonable constraints on surface paleopressure.  We find that1.5-2   bar   CO2-dominated   atmospheres   with   ≥3%   H2  can   produce   global   mean   surfacetemperatures   above   freezing,   while   also   providing   sufficient   warming   to   avoid   surfaceatmospheric CO2  condensation at 0°-45° obliquity.   Simulations conducted with both moderntopography and a paleotopography, before Tharsis formed, highlight the importance of Tharsis asa cold trap for water on the planet.

Much evidence tells us that ancient Mars had liquid water on its surface.  But reconciling thatwith the fainter young Sun and reasonable constraints on Mars' early atmosphere is challenging.We use a 3D global climate model with an atmosphere containing some amount of hydrogen (apossible greenhouse gas) to study Mars' early hydrological cycle and compare it to the geologicalevidence of surface liquid water billions of years ago.  We find that hydrogen and carbon dioxidetogether in an atmosphere twice as thick as modern Earth can warm early Mars above thefreezing point of water and that a low axial tilt produces rainfall patterns that best match thegeologic evidence"

Since climate models have difficulty sustaining a liquid hydrosphere at the surface, multiple cycles of runoff episodes may have characterized the ancient Mars climate. A fundamental question thus remains: what was the duration of these runoff-producing episodes? Here we use morphometric measurements from newly identified coupled lake systems, containing both an open- and a closed-basin lake (n=7). We combined hydrological balances with precipitation outputs from climate models, and found that breaching runoff episodes likely lasted 102−105yr; other episodes may have been shorter but could not be longer. Runoff episode durations are model-dependent and spatiallyvariable, and no27climate model scenario can satisfy a unique duration for all coupled systems. In the near future, these quantitative constraints on early Mars lake persistence may be tested through in situ observations from Perseverance rover. 

Plain Language Summary

Ancient river and lake beds on the martian surface point to a climate that was radically different in the past, unlike the dry, cold desert that Mars is today. It experienced significant liquid water flowing across the surface (i.e., ‘runoff’) and hosted long-lived bodies of water (lakes and seas). However, scientists that generate models to simulate the ancient Mars climate have difficulty sustaining this proposed liquid water cycle at the surface.  One possible hypothesis is that multiple cycles of individual liquid water episodes may have characterized the ancient martian climate (i.e. runoff episodes). A fundamental question thus remains: what was the duration of these individual runoff-producing episodes? Here we use an approach that takes advantage of unique martian lake system, ‘coupled’ lake systems, and their shapes. We combined these measurements with precipitation results from previous climate models, and found that runoff episodes likely lasted 100-10,000 years, requiring a global climate mechanism that generated repeated cycles of this duration. Ultimately, our results can be tested through observations made by NASA’s Perseverance rover, shedding light on the uninterrupted duration of surface water on Mars and its potential to host life in the past."

We report systematic electron backscatter diffraction crystallographic analysis of shock features in magnetite, from a transect across the 52-km diameter ~380 Ma Siljan impact structure in Sweden. Magnetite grains in granitoid samples contain brittle fracturing, crystal-plasticity, and lamellar twins. Deformation twins along {111} with shear direction of <112> are consistent with spinel-law twins. Inferred bulk shock pressures for investigated samples, as constrained by planar deformation features (PDFs) in quartz and shock twins in zircon, range from 0–20 GPa; onset of shock-induced twinning in magnetite is observed at >5 GPa. These results highlight the utility of magnetite to record shock deformation
in rocks that experience shock pressures >5 GPa, which may be useful in quartz-poor samples. Despite significant hydrothermal alteration, and variable transformation of host magnetite to hematite, shock effects are preserved, demonstrating that magnetite is a reliable mineral for preserving shock deformation over geologic time."

insights into both early inner solar system and early Earth chemistry. Enstatite chondrite
meteorites have highly reduced and anhydrous compositions, and their bulk isotopic
compositions closely resemble terrestrial values, suggesting that their parent body asteroids
accreted within the inner protoplanetary disk and were a primary contributor during Earth’s
late accretion (Javoy, 1995; Piani et al., 2020). Here, we present the first report of amino
acids in enstatite chondrite meteorite samples. Three EH3 meteorites were analyzed
(Dominion Range [DOM] 14021, Larkman Nunatak [LAR] 12001, and Larkman Nunatak
06252). The acid-hydrolyzed water extracts of the meteorites contained low abundances
(1.5–215.9 pmol per g) of n-ω-amino acids (glycine, β-alanine, γ-amino-n-butyric acid [γ-
ABA], δ-amino-n-valeric acid [δ-AVA], and ϵ-amino-n-caproic acid [ϵ-ACA]), but amino acids
were not present above detection limits in the nonhydrolyzed samples. The low amino acid
abundances and the predominance of n-ω-amino acids resemble amino acid distributions
previously observed for thermally altered chondrites. These results suggest that the parent body
asteroid was not conducive to the synthesis and/or preservation of α-amino acids, or free amino
acids in general, and that EH3 chondrite-like material may not have been a primary contributor of

a wide range of inherent optical properties (IOPs) to (1) examine if the water refectance is appropriately reproduced and (2) 
correct measured refectance in terms of its bidirectionality. Based on a good reproducibility of water refectance using the 
PR05, the optimized IOPs are further used for explaining errors in estimates of chl a concentration and CDOM absorption

underestimate at chl a higher than 2.0 mg m−3 is observed, which is further shown by independent match-up analyses.

Cellular homeostasis in the adult requires molecular maintenance and  repair  of  non-dividing  cells  such  as  cardiomyocytes  and  neurons,  but  also  stem  cell-based  tissue regeneration  via  direct  replacement  of  cell  loss,  such  as  in  the  blood,  immune  system,  bone,  skin, liver, intestine,  and  other  tissues.    Because  stem  cell-based  tissue  regenerative  health  requires  constant proliferation and differentiation of stem cell progenitors in the bone marrow, and other adult stem cell niches, it is uniquely sensitive to the stresses of spaceflight including exposure to space radiation and mechanical unloading in microgravity.  A key central hypothesis in this field is that those spaceflight stress factors can have profound negative effects on long-term tissue regenerative health mediated by adult stem cells, and that unmitigated, they may lead to premature tissue aging and functional failure.  Specifically, it is thought that mechanical unloading due to lack of weight-bearing in space reduces mitogenic 
mechanotransduction necessary to promote adult stem cell proliferation and differentiation, and that space radiation can also lead to activation of cell cycle arrest mechanisms, further reducing adult stem cell proliferation. These hypotheses are being tested in low earth orbit(LEO)using a variety of cellular and whole organism tissue model systems, suggesting  that  spaceflight  consistently  interferes  with  stem  cell  tissue  regenerative  processes  such  as  in mammalian  embryoid  bodies,  regenerating  newt  tails,  and  mouse  bone  marrow  hematopoietic  and osteoprogenitor  cells.

Unlike in previous observing runs in the advanced detector era, we include Virgo in the search for the GWB. The results of the search are consistent with uncorrelated noise, and therefore we place upper limits on the strength of the GWB. We find that the dimensionless energy density Ω(sub GW) ≤  5.8 × 10(exp -9) at the 95% credible level for a at (frequency-independent) GWB, using a prior which is uniform in the log of the strength of the GWB, with 99% of the sensitivity coming from the band 20-76.6 Hz; Ω(sub GW)(f) ≤ 3.4 × 10(exp -9) at 25 Hz for a power-law GWB with a spectral index of 2/3 (consistent with expectations for compact binary coalescences), in the band 20-90.6 Hz; and Ω(sub GW)(f) ≤ 3.9 × 10(exp -10) at 25 Hz for a spectral index of 3, in the band 20-291.6 Hz. These upper limits improve over our previous results by a factor of 6.0 for a at GWB, 8.8 for a spectral index of 2/3, and 13.1 for a spectral index of 3. We also search for a GWB arising from scalar and vector modes, which are predicted by alternative theories of gravity; we do not find evidence of these, and place upper limits on the strength of GWBs with these polarizations. We demonstrate that there is no evidence of correlated noise of magnetic origin by performing a Bayesian analysis that allows for the presence of both a GWB and an effective magnetic background arising from geophysical Schumann resonances. We compare our upper limits to a fiducial model for the GWB from the merger of compact binaries, updating the model to use the most recent data-driven population inference from the systems detected during O3a. Finally, we combine our results with observations of individual mergers and show that, at design sensitivity, this joint approach may yield stronger constraints on the merger rate of binary black holes at z ≳ 2 than can be achieved with individually resolved mergers alone."

Previous studies have concluded that, generally, five moderately separated viewing angles in each spectral band provide sufficient accuracy for aerosol property retrievals, with performance gradually saturating as angles are added above that threshold. The Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP) instruments provide high angular sampling with a total of 90-120 unique angles across four bands, a capability developed mainly for liquid cloud retrievals. In practice, not all view angles are optimal for aerosol retrievals due to impacts of clouds, sun glint, and other impediments. The many viewing angles of HARP can provide resilience to these effects, if the impacted views are screened from the dataset, as the remaining views may be sufficient for successful analysis. In this study, we discuss how the number of available viewing angles impacts aerosol and ocean color retrieval uncertainties, as applied to two versions of the HARP instrument. AirHARP is an airborne prototype that was deployed in the ACEPOL field campaign, while HARP2 is an instrument in development for the upcoming NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission. Based on synthetic data, we find that a total of 20-30 angles across all bands (i.e. five to eight viewing angles per band) are sufficient to achieve good retrieval performance. Following from this result, we develop an adaptive multi-angle polarimetric data screening (MAPDS) approach to evaluate data quality by comparing measurements with their best-fitted forward model. The FastMAPOL retrieval algorithm is used to retrieve scene geophysical values, by matching an efficient, deep learning-based, radiative transfer emulator to observations. The data screening method effectively identifies and removes viewing angles affected by thin cirrus clouds and other anomalies, improving retrieval performance. This was tested with AirHARP data, and we found agreement with the High Spectral Resolution Lidar-2 (HSRL-2) aerosol data. The data screening approach can be applied to modern satellite remote sensing missions, such as PACE, where a large amount of multi-angle, hyperspectral, polarimetric measurements will be collected."

In response to increasing hot-weather episodes, the risk of heat-related illnesses and mortality is disproportionately affecting neighborhoods in Yonkers historically subjected to race-based housing segregation. NASA DEVELOP collaborated with Groundwork Hudson Valley to determine regions within Yonkers that are experiencing the most intense urban heat island effects, identify and rank sociodemographic and environmental determinants of increasing community-level vulnerability, map these vulnerabilities as a combined vulnerability index, complete a proximity analysis of walkability to local cooling centers and health facility locations, and model potential cooling strategies. The study area consisted of Yonkers, NY and the analyses used data from 2015-2020 (June through August). The project utilized NASA Earth observation products including Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS). We assessed the benefits of different heat-mitigation scenarios by utilizing the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) urban cooling model.

The vehicle is envisioned to employ deflections of its geometry to modulate angle of attack and sideslip angle for trajectory control. Modified Newtonian methods were used to compute hypersonic continuum aerodynamics. Direct simulation Monte Carlo calculations were carried out to compute data in the rarefied transitional regime. Free-molecular theory was used to compute values in the free-molecular regime. A bridging function method was then used to bridge data from all three flow regimes together and produce a database that can be used for future trajectory simulations to assess the vehicle’s performance. The vehicle was found to have the control authority in hypersonic continuum to effect an 18 deg change in the trim angle of attack using a 10 deg deflection of the pitching control surfaces. Similarly, a 6 deg change in the trim sideslip angle could be achieved with a 5 deg deflection of the yawing control surfaces. Different configurations of the vehicle were found to be statically stable in pitch and yaw in the continuum regime, but
unstable in the rarefied and free-molecular regimes."

In oblique flow, propellers exhibit deviations in thrust and torque oriented along the propeller axis of rotation, as well as significant off-axis forces and moments. Although important for modeling eVTOL aircraft aerodynamics, sparse experimental data or mathematical models exist for propellers at incidence. This paper describes a propulsion system modeling methodology for the LA-8 tandem tilt-wing, eVTOL aircraft. System identification methods are applied to isolated propeller wind tunnel data gathered across the vehicle's flight envelope to develop a mathematical model of the propulsion system, including a static motor model, dynamic motor model, and propeller aerodynamic model. Modeling results validated against data withheld from the modeling process indicate good predictive capability and agree with theoretical expectations.

We present first science observations taken during the commissioning activities of the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) instrument on the ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter mission. SPICE is a high-resolution imaging spectrometer operating at extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths. In this paper we illustrate the possible types of observations to give prospective users a better understanding of the science capabilities of SPICE.

Methods. We have reviewed the data obtained by SPICE between April and June 2020 and selected representative results obtained with different slits and a range of exposure times between 5 s and 180 s. Standard instrumental corrections have been applied to the raw data.

Results. The paper discusses the first observations of the Sun on different targets and presents an example of the full spectra from the quiet Sun, identifying over 40 spectral lines from neutral hydrogen and ions of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, neon, sulphur, magnesium, and iron. These lines cover the temperature range between 20,000 K and 1 million K (10MK in flares), providing slices of the Sun’s atmosphere in narrow temperature intervals. We provide a list of count rates for the 23 brightest spectral lines. We show examples of raster images of the quiet Sun in several strong transition region lines, where we have found unusually bright, compact structures in the quiet Sun network, with extreme intensities up to 25 times greater than the average intensity across the image. The lifetimes of these structures can exceed 2.5 hours. We identify them as a transition region signature of coronal bright points and compare their areas and intensity enhancements. We also show the first above-limb measurements with SPICE above the polar limb in C III,O VI, and Ne VIII lines, and far off limb measurements in the equatorial plane in Mg IX, Ne VIII, and O VI lines. We discuss the potential to use abundance diagnostics methods to study the variability of the elemental composition that can be compared with in situ measurements to help confirm the magnetic connection between the spacecraft location and the Sun’s surface, and locate the sources of the solar wind.

Conclusions. The SPICE instrument successfully performs measurements of EUV spectra and raster images that will make vital contributions to the scientific success of the Solar Orbiter mission"

However, a lack of global diagnostics that reflect the forest stage and associated disturbance regimes hampers the quantification of age-related differences in forest carbon dynamics. This study provides a new global distribution of forest age circa 2010, estimated using a machine learning approach trained with more than 40 000 plots using forest inventory, biomass and climate data. First, an evaluation against the plot-level measurements of forest age reveals that the data-driven method has a relatively good predictive capacity of classifying old-growth vs. non-old-growth (precision = 0.81 and 0.99 for old-growth and non-old-growth, respectively) forests and estimating corresponding forest age estimates (NSE = 0.6 – Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency – and RMSE = 50 years – root-mean-square error). However, there are systematic biases of overestimation in young- and underestimation in old-forest stands, respectively. Globally, we find a large variability in forest age with the old-growth forests in the tropical regions of Amazon and Congo, young forests in China, and intermediate stands in Europe. Furthermore, we find that the regions with high rates of deforestation or forest degradation (e.g. the arc of deforestation in the Amazon) are composed mainly of younger stands. Assessment of forest age in the climate space shows that the old forests are either in cold and dry regions or warm and wet regions, while young–intermediate forests span a large climatic gradient. Finally, comparing the presented forest age estimates with a series of regional products reveals differences rooted in different approaches and different in situ observations and global-scale products. Despite showing robustness in cross-validation results, additional methodological insights on further developments should as much as possible harmonize data across the different approaches. The forest age dataset presented here provides additional insights into the global distribution of forest age to better understand the global dynamics in the forest water and carbon cycles. The forest age datasets are openly available at https://doi.org/10.17871/ForestAgeBGI.2021 (Besnard et al., 2021)."

One of the primary requirements placed on the predicted trajectory performance was based on the performance during orbital phases leading up to the maneuver to initiate the Touch-and-Go (TAG) trajectory descent. Throughout ProxOps the nominal force models being used to predict the spacecraft trajectory were updated in an effort to improve the prediction performance. The most significant models that contributed to prediction performance were of solar radiation pressure, thermal reradiation of the spacecraft, predicted attitude errors, and desaturation maneuvers. Efforts were made throughout all of ProxOps to monitor, trend, predict, and update spacecraft modeling to improve the prediction performance. These efforts were vital to reduce the spacecraft knowledge errors necessary to achieve a TAG target smaller than pre-launch analysis allowed due to the rough terrain of Bennu. Increased precision in predicted trajectory errors allowed for refined uncertainties to be used for future phase planning throughout the mission. The navigation team successfully predicted the spacecraft trajectory throughout all of ProxOps achieving predicted trajectories errors less than originally analyzed."

Due to the short event duration (t(sub E) ∼ 6.5 days), the secondary object in this system could potentially be a massive giant planet. A Bayesian analysis shows that the system most likely consists of a host star with a mass M(sub h) = 0.09(+0.14/-0.05) M⨀ and a massive giant planet with a mass = M(sub h) = 7.70(+11.34/-3.90) M(sub Jup). However, the interpretation of the secondary as a planet (i.e., as having M(sub p) < 13M(sub Jup)) rests entirely on the Bayesian analysis. Motivated by this event, we conduct an investigation to determine which constraints meaningfully affect Bayesian analyses for microlensing events. We find that the masses inferred from such a Bayesian analysis are determined almost entirely by the measured value of θ(sub E) and are relatively insensitive to other factors such as the direction of the event (l,b), the lens–source relative proper motion μ(sub rel), or the specific Galactic model prior."

Using TESS and ground-based photometry as well as radial velocities from the CORALIE, CHIRON, TRES, and FEROS spectrographs, we found the companions have orbital periods between 4.8 and 27.2 days, masses between 77 and 98 MJup , and radii between 0.81 and 1.66 RJup . These targets have masses near the uncertain lower limit of hydrogen core fusion (~73-96 MJup ), which separates brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We constrained young ages for TOI-587 (0.2 ± 0.1 Gyr) and TOI-681 (0.17 ± 0.03 Gyr) and found them to have relatively larger radii compared to other transiting companions of a similar mass. Conversely we estimated older ages for TOI-148 and TOI-746 and found them to have relatively smaller companion radii. With an effective temperature of 9800 ± 200 K, TOI-587 is the hottest known main-sequence star to host a transiting brown dwarf or very low-mass star. We found evidence of spin-orbit synchronization for TOI-148 and TOI-746 as well as tidal circularization for TOI-148. These companions add to the population of brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars with well measured parameters ideal to test formation models of these rare objects, the origin of the brown dwarf desert, and the distinction between brown dwarfs and hydrogen-burning main sequence stars."

Comparisons between two reanalyses (MERRA-2 and ERA5) and EPIC reveal that MERRA-2 has a generally larger deviation from EPIC than ERA5, in terms of the SW radiance and diurnal variability in all seasons, which can be attributed to larger cloud biases in MERRA-2. MERRA-2 produces more ice/liquid water content than ERA5 over the tropical warm pool, leading to positive SW biases in cloud and radiance, while both reanalyses underestimate the observed SW radiance from EPIC in the stratus-topped region off the western coast of US/Mexico in the boreal summer. Himalaya/Tibet region in the boreal spring/summer and the midlatitude Southern Hemisphere in the boreal winter are the regions where MERRA-2 and ERA5 deviate largely from EPIC but their deviations have the opposite sign. Vertical structures of cloud ice/liquid water content explain reasonably well these contrasting differences between the two reanalyses. As two independent observa-ions, CERES and EPIC agree well with each other in terms of the SW radiance maps, showing 2-3% mean absolute errors over the tropical-midlatitudes. The CERES-EPIC consistency further confirms that the reanalyses still have challenges in representing the SW flux and its global distribution. In the CERES-EPIC observation differences, CERES slightly overestimates the diurnal cycle (as a function of local solar time) of the observed EPIC irradiance in the morning and underestimates in the after-noon, while the opposite is the case in the reanalyses."

This study presents an alternate method to estimate the daily rainfall amount using the emissivity temporal variation (i.e., Δe) under rain-free conditions at low-frequency channels (19, 24, and 37 GHz). Emissivity is derived from 10 passive microwave radiometers, including the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), three Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounders (SSMIS), the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), and four Advanced Microwave Sounding Units-A (AMSU-A). Four different satellite combination schemes are used to derive the Δe for daily rainfall estimates. They are all 10 satellites, 5 imagers, 6 satellites with very different equator crossing times, and GMI only. Results show that Δe from all 10 satellites has the best performance with a correlation of 0.60 and RMSE of 6.52 mm, compared with the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final run product. The 6-satellites scheme has comparable performance with the all-10-satellites scheme. The 5-imagers scheme performs noticeably worse with a correlation of 0.49 and RMSE of 7.28 mm, while the GMI-only scheme performs the worst with a correlation of 0.25 and RMSE of 11.36 mm. The inferior performance from the 5-imagers and GMI-only schemes can be explained by the much longer revisit time, which cannot accurately capture the emissivity temporal variation."

For sea ice applications, successfully discriminating returns between sea ice and open water is key for accurately determining freeboard (the extension of sea ice above local sea level) and new information regarding the geometry of sea ice floes and leads. We take advantage of near-coincident optical imagery obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite over the Western Weddell Sea of the Southern Ocean in March 2019 and the Lincoln Sea of the Arctic Ocean in May 2019 to evaluate the surface classification scheme in the ICESat-2 ATL07 and ATL10 sea ice products. We find a high level of agreement between the ATL07 (specular) lead classification and visible leads in the S-2 imagery in these two coincident images across all six ICESat-2 beams, increasing our confidence in the freeboard products and deriving new estimates of the sea ice state. The S-2 overlays provide additional, albeit limited, evidence of the misclassification of dark leads due to clouds. Dark leads are no longer used to derive sea surface and thus freeboard as of the third release (r003) of the ICESat-2 sea ice products. We show estimates of lead fraction and more preliminary estimates of chord length (a proxy for floe size) using two metrics for classifying sea surface (lead) segments across both the Arctic and Southern Ocean for the first winter season of data collection."

The presented strategy involved constructing a dataset consisting of synoptic data, automatic rain gauge (ARG) measurements, and satellite data that are co-registered, consistent, and formatted in the same manner. Although sparse in number, the synoptic stations provide the most accurate rainfall information and were used as the baseline for creating the dataset. The ARGs that are within a distance of 1 km to the synoptic stations were used to determine the correction factors needed to make the synoptic and ARG data consistent. Subsequently, the corrected ARGs were used to make the satellite IMERG data consistent with both ARG and synoptic data. In case of the latter, only IMERG pixels with at least 10 ARGs within the relatively large footprint of the satellite sensor were used in estimating the required correction parameters derived from a combination of a power transform and linear regression correction techniques. The final results show good agreement of synoptic and corrected ARG data with correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.97 for the 10 day and monthly data, respectively, and improvement in the linear regression slope from 0.67 to 0.90 for 10 day data, and 0.70 to 0.94 for monthly data. In addition, the corrected ARG data agree well with the corrected IMERG data, with correlation coefficients of 0.88 and 0.93 for the 10 day and monthly data, respectively, and an improvement in slope from 0.66 to 0.87 for 10 day data, and 0.74 to 0.99 for monthly data. The merit of using a combined dataset is illustrated through comparative analyses of the IMERG data and spatially interpolated synoptic and ARG data. The results show general agreements in spatial patterns of rainfall across the datasets, especially in areas where in situ measurements are recorded. The observed discrepancy when ground data is limited emphasizes the need for satellite IMERG data to obtain the true spatial patterns of rainfall distribution."

The mass-weighted mean diameter Dm is a characteristic parameter of the precipitation particle size distribution (PSD), estimated from the GPM Combined Radar–Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) using data from GPM’s dual-frequency precipitation radar and microwave imager. We examine Dm in individual precipitation systems in different climate regimes and investigate a 6-yr (2014–20) global climatology within 70°N–70°S. The vertical structure of Dm is demonstrated with cases of deep convection, frontal rain and snow, and stratocumulus light rain. The Dm values, detectable by GPM, range from ~0.7 mm in stratocumulus precipitation to >3.5 mm in the ice layers of intense convection. Within the constraint of the 12-dBZ detectability threshold, the smallest annual mean Dm (~0.8 mm) are found in the eastern oceans, and the largest values (~2 mm) occur above the melting levels in convection over land in summer. The standard deviation of the annual mean is generally <0.45 mm below 6 km. Climate regimes are characterized with Dm annual/seasonal variations, its convective/stratiform components, and vertical variabilities (2–10 km). The U.S. Central Plains and Argentina are associated with the largest Dm in a deep layer. Tropical Africa has larger Dm and standard deviation than Amazon. Large convective Dm occurs at high latitudes of Eurasia and North America in summer; the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes have shallower systems with smaller Dm. Oceanic storm tracks in both hemispheres have relatively large Dm, particularly for convective Dm in winter. Relatively small Dm occurs over tropical oceans, including ITCZ, requiring further investigation."

AACP-origin hydration of the stratosphere has a poorly constrained role in ozone destruction and surface warming. In this study, we use large eddy simulations corroborated by radar observations to understand the physics of AACP generation. We show that the overshooting top of a simulated supercell can act as a topographic obstacle and drive a hydraulic jump downstream at the tropopause, similar to a windstorm moving down the slope of a mountain but without solid topography. Once the jump is established, water vapor injection deep into the stratosphere may exceed 7 tonnes per second."

The core satellite carries a dual-precipitation radar and an advanced microwave imager which provide measurements to retrieve the drop size distribution (DSD) and rain rates using a Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA). Our objective is to validate key assumptions and parameterizations in CORRA and enable improved estimation of precipitation products, especially in the middle-to-higher latitudes in both hemispheres. The DSD parameters and statistical relationships between DSD parameters and radar measurements are a central part of the rainfall retrieval algorithm, which is complicated by regimes where DSD measurements are abysmally sparse (over the open ocean). In view of this, we have assembled optical disdrometer datasets gathered by research vessels, ground stations, and aircrafts to simulate radar observables and validate the scattering lookup tables used in CORRA. The joint use of all DSD datasets spans a large range of drop concentrations and characteristic drop diameters. The scaling normalization of DSDs defines an intercept parameter N(W), which normalizes the concentrations, and a scaling diameter D(m), which compresses or stretches the diameter coordinate axis. A major finding of this study is that a single relationship between N(W) and D(m), on average, unifies all datasets included, from stratocumulus to heavier rainfall regimes. A comparison with the N(W)–D(m) relation used as a constraint in versions 6 and 7 of CORRA highlights the scope for improvement of rainfall retrievals for small drops (D(m) < 1 mm) and large drops (D(m) > 2 mm). The normalized specific attenuation–reflectivity relationships used in the combined algorithm are also found to match well the equivalent relationships derived using DSDs from the three datasets, suggesting that the currently assumed lookup tables are not a major source of uncertainty in the combined algorithm rainfall estimates."

Based on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) H datasets, we calculate CRKs (called ISCCP-FH or FH CRKs) as 2D joint function/histogram of cloud optical depth and cloud top pressure for shortwave (SW), longwave (LW), and their sum, Net, at the top of atmosphere (TOA), as well as, for the first time, at the surface (SFC) and in the atmosphere (ATM). With cloud fraction change (CFC) datasets from doubled-CO2 simulation and short-term observational anomalies, we derive all the TOA, SFC and ATM cloud feedback for SW, LW and Net using our CRKs.The direct comparison with modeled and observed CRKs (or cloud radiative effects), cloud feedback from previous model results and the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System products show that our CRKs and CRK-derived cloud feedback are reasonably well validated. We estimate the uncertainty for the CRK-derived cloud feedback and show that the CFC-associated uncertainty contributes >98.5% of the total cloud feedback uncertainty while CRK's is very small. Our preliminary evaluation also shows that some near-zero/small cloud feedback in the TOA-alone feedback indeed results from the compensation of sizable cloud feedback of the SFC and ATM feedback and reveals some significant surface and atmospheric cloud feedback whose sum appears insignificant in TOA-alone feedback. In addition, the atmospheric longwave cloud feedback seems to play a role in enhancing meridional atmospheric energy transport."

This study describes the ARTMIP Tier 2 experimental design and initial results using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Phases 5 and 6 multi-model ensembles.  We show that AR statistics from a given ARDT in CMIP5/6 historical simulations compare remarkably well with the MERRA-2 reanalysis.  In CMIP5/6 future simulations, most ARDTs project a global increase in AR frequency, counts, and sizes, especially along the western coastlines of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.  We find that the choice of ARDT is the dominant contributor to the uncertainty in projected AR frequency when compared with model choice. These results imply that new projects investigating future changes in ARs should explicitly consider ARDT uncertainty as a core part of the experimental design.

Plain Language Summary: Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are a type of weather pattern known to be important for moving water vapor from the warm, moist tropics to the cool, dry polar regions; when they reach midlatitudes in the winter time, they are commonly associated with heavy precipitation.  Recent studies that assess the impacts of global climate change on ARs tend to agree that there will be more ARs in a warmer climate, and that ARs will tend to be more extreme.  However, it has been increasingly recognized by the AR research community that these results may depend on the method used to identify ARs and the choice of climate model.  This study reports results from a controlled experiment, involving an international research community, that aims to show how different AR identification methods and climate models might impact our scientific understanding of ARs in the future.  This experiment shows that there will likely be more ARs in the future, and that ARs will generally have a larger spatial footprint.  This experiment also shows that uncertainty in these results are large, with the uncertainty from AR identification methods outweighing that of climate models.  Future efforts to better understand the physics of ARs may help us reduce this uncertainty."

However, calibration studies using in situ data to assess the relative contributions of warming and freshening to coral δ^(18)O records are exceedingly rare. Furthermore, the fidelity of coral δ^(18)O records under the most severe thermal stress events is difficult to assess. Here, we present six coral δ^(18)O records and in situ temperature, salinity, and seawater δ^(18)O data from Kiritimati Island (2°N, 157°W) spanning the very strong 2015/16 El Niño event. Local sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies of +2.4 ± 0.4°C and seawater δ^(18)O anomalies of −0.19 ± 0.02‰ contribute to the observed coral δ^(18)O anomalies of −0.58 ± 0.05‰, consistent with a ∼70% contribution from SST and ∼30% from seawater δ^(18)O. Our results demonstrate that Kiritimati coral δ^(18)O records can provide reliable reconstructions even during the largest class of El Niño events."

The Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) on board CloudSat is sensitive to snowfall, and other satellite missions and climatological models have used snowfall properties measured by it for evaluating and comparing against their snowfall products. Since a battery anomaly in 2011, the CPR has operated in a Daylight-Only Operations (DO-Op) mode, in which it makes measurements primarily during only the daylit portion of its orbit. This work provides estimates of biases inherent in global snowfall amounts derived from CPR measurements due to this shift to DO-Op mode. We use CloudSat’s snowfall measurements during its Full Operations (Full-Op) period prior to the battery anomaly to evaluate the impact of the DO-Op mode sampling. For multi-year global mean values, the snowfall fraction during DO-Op changes by −10.16% and the mean snowfall rate changes by −8.21% compared with Full-Op. These changes are driven by the changes in sampling in DO-Op and are very little influenced by changes in meteorology between the Full-Op and DO-Op periods. The results highlight the need to sample consistently with the CloudSat observations or to adjust snowfall estimates derived from CloudSat when using DO-Op data to evaluate other precipitation products."

At subparsec separations, binaries become strong sources of low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), targeted by Pulsar Timing Arrays. We used recent upper limits on continuous GWs from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 11 yr data set to place constraints on putative SMBHBs in nearby massive galaxies. We compiled a comprehensive catalog of ∼44,000 galaxies in the local universe (up to redshift ∼0.05) and populated them with hypothetical binaries, assuming that the total mass of the binary is equal to the SMBH mass derived from global scaling relations. Assuming circular equal-mass binaries emitting at NANOGrav's most sensitive frequency of 8 nHz, we found that 216 galaxies are within NANOGrav's sensitivity volume. We ranked the potential SMBHBs based on GW detectability by calculating the total signal-to-noise ratio such binaries would induce within the NANOGrav array. We placed constraints on the chirp mass and mass ratio of the 216 hypothetical binaries. For 19 galaxies, only very unequal-mass binaries are allowed, with the mass of the secondary less than 10% that of the primary, roughly comparable to constraints on an SMBHB in the Milky Way. However, we demonstrated that the (typically large) uncertainties in the mass measurements can weaken the upper limits on the chirp mass. Additionally, we were able to exclude binaries delivered by major mergers (mass ratio of at least 1/4) for several of these galaxies. We also derived the first limit on the density of binaries delivered by major mergers purely based on GW data."

Prelaunch pointing alignment errors and postlaunch pointing alignment variation result in large geolocation errors that must be calibrated on orbit. In addition, the changing sun-orbit geometry causes thermal-mechanical forced laser frame alignment variations at the orbit period and trends from days, weeks, and months. Early mission analysis computed precise postlaunch laser beam alignment calibration. The alignment calibration was uploaded to the spacecraft and enabled the pointing control performance to achieve 4.4 ± 6.0 m, a significant improvement over the 45 m (1 σ) mission requirement. Laser frame alignment calibrations are used to reduce the alignment bias and time variation, as well as the orbital variation contributions to geolocation knowledge error from 6 to 1.7 m (1 σ). Relative beam alignment of the six beams is calibrated and shown to contribute between 0.5 ± 0.1 m and 2.4 ± 0.2 m of remaining geolocation knowledge error. Independent geolocation assessment based on comparison to high-resolution digital elevation models agrees well with the calibration geolocation error estimates. The analysis demonstrates the ICESat-2 mission is performing far better than its geolocation knowledge requirement of 6.5 m (1 σ) after the laser frame alignment bias variation and orbital variation calibrations have been applied. Remaining geolocation error is beam dependent and ranges from 2.5 m for beam 6 to 4.4 m for beam 2 (mean + 1 σ)."

Two recent international projects generated a large suite of projections using multiple models2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but primarily used previous-generation scenarios9 and climate models10, and could not fully explore known uncertainties. Here we estimate probability distributions for these projections under the new scenarios11,12 using statistical emulation of the ice sheet and glacier models. We find that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would halve the land ice contribution to twenty-first-century sea level rise, relative to current emissions pledges. The median decreases from 25 to 13 centimetres sea level equivalent (SLE) by 2100, with glaciers responsible for half the sea level contribution. The projected Antarctic contribution does not show a clear response to the emissions scenario, owing to uncertainties in the competing processes of increasing ice loss and snowfall accumulation in a warming climate. However, under risk-averse (pessimistic) assumptions, Antarctic ice loss could be five times higher, increasing the median land ice contribution to 42 centimetres SLE under current policies and pledges, with the 95th percentile projection exceeding half a metre even under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming. This would severely limit the possibility of mitigating future coastal flooding. Given this large range (between 13 centimetres SLE using the main projections under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming and 42 centimetres SLE using risk-averse projections under current pledges), adaptation planning for twenty-first-century sea level rise must account for a factor-of-three uncertainty in the land ice contribution until climate policies and the Antarctic response are further constrained."

Weather and atmospheric conditions created a favorable environment to transport the plume through the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, metro areas in the afternoon and concentrate smoke near the surface, degrading air quality for several hours. ABI AOD with 5-min temporal resolution and 2-km spatial resolution definitively identified the timing and geographic extent of the plume during daylight hours. Comparison to AERONET AOD indicates that ABI AOD captured the relative change in AOD due to passage of the smoke, with a mean absolute error of 0.047. Ground-based measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) confirm deteriorations in air quality coincident with the progression of the smoke. Ceilometer aerosol backscatter profiles verify plume transport timing and indicate that smoke aerosols were well mixed in a shallow boundary layer. This event illustrates the advantages of using multiple datasets to analyze the impacts of aerosols on ambient air quality. Given the quickly evolving nature of the event over several hours, ABI AOD provided information for the public and decision-makers that was not available from any other source, including polar-orbiting satellite sensors. This study suggests that PM2.5 concentrations estimated from ABI AOD can be used to fill in the gaps in nationwide regulatory PM2.5 monitor networks and may be a valuable addition to EPA’s PM2.5 NowCast of current air quality conditions."

This study examines the properties of TCs in two different versions of E3 at different points in its development cycle, run for 20 years at 0.5 degree resolution, and compares these TCs with observations, the previous generation GISS model, E2, and other climate models. E3 shares many TC biases common to global climate models, such as having too few tropical cyclones, but is much improved from E2. E3 produces strong enough TCs that observation-based wind speed thresholds can now be used to detect and track them, and some storms now reach hurricane intensity; neither of these was true of E2. Model development between the first and second versions of E3 further increased the number and intensity of TCs and reduced TC count biases globally and in most regions. One-year sensitivity tests to changes in various microphysical and dynamical tuning parameters are also examined. Increasing the entrainment rate for the more strongly-entraining plume in the convection scheme increases the number of TCs (though also affecting other climate variables, and in some cases increasing biases). Variations in divergence damping did not have a strong effect on simulated TC properties, contrary to expectations based on previous studies. Overall, the improvements in E3 make it more credible for studies of TC activity and its relationship to climate."

Existing estimates of changes in Antarctic ice-sheet height, which can be used to infer changes in mass, are only accurate at multiyear time scales. However, NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) laser altimetry mission now allows us to accurately measure changes in ice-sheet height at subannual time scales. Here, we use ICESat-2 data to estimate height changes over Antarctica between April 2019 and June 2020. These data show widespread increases in surface height over West Antarctica during the 2019 austral winter. Using climate reanalysis data, we show that 41% of increases in height during winter were from snow accumulation via extreme precipitation events—63% of these events were associated with landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) which occurred only 5.1% of the time."

This paper refines the developed MDO method by using multifidelity models for CFD-based multiobjective MDO and a better method for the system-level trade between the target low boom ground noise level and the overland range. The refined MDO method can generate a low-boom configuration that satisfies the mission requirements, has the lowest takeoff gross weight and the longest range for the low-boom mission, trims the low-boom cruise flight with fuel redistributions, and has a reversed equivalent area distribution closely matching a low-boom target with ground noise level below 70 PLdB. The validity of the refined MDO method is demonstrated by a design study of a low-boom supersonic transport that carries 40 passengers, flies a low-boom mission with cruise Mach of 1.7 and range of 3500 nm, and cruises overwater at Mach 1.8 with range of 3882 nm. Moreover, the refined MDO method eliminates the difference between the assumed cruise weight for CFD-based low-boom inverse design optimization and the estimated cruise weight of the optimal inverse design solution with respect to the mission requirements."

The K2 light curve showed two additional transit events consistent with a sixth planet. Using Spitzer photometry, we validate the sixth planet's orbital period of 41.966 ± 0.006 days and measure a radius of 3.44 (+0.32,-.031)Rꚛ, solidifying K2-138 as the K2 system with the most currently known planets. There is a sizeable gap between the outer two planets, since the fifth planet in the system, K2-138 f, orbits at 12.76 days. We explore the possibility of additional nontransiting planets in the gap between f and g. Due to the relative brightness of the K2-138 host star, and the near resonance of the inner planets, K2-138 could be a key benchmark system for both radial velocity and transit-timing variation mass measurements, and indeed radial velocity masses for the inner four planets have already been obtained.

Remote sensing from suborbital and satellite-based platforms utilizes these radiance and polarization signals to retrieve the key properties of these aerosols. Recent retrieval algorithms have shown a progressive trend toward including multi-angular and multi-spectral polarimetric measurements to produce better retrieval accuracy in comparison to those using measurements based on a single viewing angle. Here, we perform a theoretical investigation of the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance-related reflectance factor (bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF)) and the two types of polarimetry-related factors (polarized bidirectional reflectance factor (pBRF) and the degree of linear polarization (DoLP)) for different types of atmospheric light-absorbing carbonaceous aerosols as a function of particle size distribution. We selected three polarimetric bands corresponding to those utilized by NASA's Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI)—near-UV (470 nm), visible (660 nm), and near-infrared (865 nm)—for our simulations which were performed over ocean surface using the successive order of scattering (SOS) algorithm coupled to a Lorenz-Mie aerosol optics model. The analysis of particle phase matrix elements indicates a close relationship between the angular dependencies of DoLP and associated phase matrix components at the shortest polarimetric band (470 nm). Using Jacobian analysis, we find that the radiance- and polarimetry-related reflectance factors of weakly light-absorbing aerosols, such as brown carbon, are more sensitive to changes in particle size and imaginary refractive index in comparison with those of black carbon, which is strongly light-absorbing. Our results suggest that the DoLP data could be used by future retrieval algorithms for reliably estimating microphysical properties of absorbing carbonaceous aerosols with imaginary refractive index less than 0.4."

With a few exceptions, these scheduled lunar observations have been performed with the same phase angles ranging from -51.5° to -50.5°. In addition to these observations that require a roll maneuver, the VIIRS instruments also view the Moon via its space-view port without a roll maneuver, covering a wide range of phase angles. In this paper, we present techniques used to derive the radiometric gain for the VIIRS RSB using unscheduled lunar observations that are made over a range of phase angles. An empirical correction to account for residual phase angle dependencies is derived from on-orbit SNPP VIIRS unscheduled lunar events and is successfully applied to estimate the radiometric gain that shows good agreement with the gains derived from the scheduled lunar events as well as those derived from the solar diffuser. In addition to the follow-on VIIRS instrument on the NOAA-20 satellite, three more VIIRS instruments are scheduled to be launched in the next decade. The methodologies developed in this work are expected to be applied to unscheduled lunar events from other VIIRS instruments to support their on-orbit RSB calibration."

The Case of τSco,"τSco, a well-studied magnetic B-type star in the Upper Sco association, has a number of surprising characteristics. It rotates very slowly and shows nitrogen excess. Its surface magnetic field is much more complex than a purely dipolar configuration which is unusual for a magnetic massive star. We employ the CMFGEN radiative transfer code to determine the fundamental parameters and surface CNO and helium abundances. Then, we employ MESA and GENEC stellar evolution models accounting for the effects of surface magnetic fields. To reconcileτSco’s properties with single-star models, an increase is necessary in the efficiency of rotational mixing by a factor of 3–10 and in the efficiency of magnetic braking by a factor of 10. The spin-down could be explained by assuming a magnetic field decay scenario. However, the simultaneous chemical enrichment challenges the single-star scenario. Previous works indeed suggested a stellar merger origin forτSco. However, the merger scenario also faces similar challenges as our magnetic single-star models to explainτSco’s simultaneous slow rotation and nitrogen excess. In conclusion, the single-star channel seems less likely and versatile to explain these discrepancies, while the merger scenario and other potential binary-evolution channels still require further assessment as to whether they may self-consistently explain the observables of τSco."

hold samples, such as lunar rocks, from different space exploration missions. Bacillus sp.
are frequently detected in routine microbial monitoring of these facilities. Since this, and
related genera, can form endospores that can withstand harsh conditions, they could
contaminate astromaterials. This could confound searches for extraterrestrial life. Whole
genome sequencing (WGS) is widely used for identifying bacterial strains and tracking
their source; however, WGS is expensive and time consuming. Matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization– time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) shows promise as
a low-cost, rapid method of identifying strains of bacteria, but few studies have compared
this proteomics method to WGS. To evaluate a high throughput method of tracking the
source of contamination of this built environment, WGS and MALDI-TOF was
conducted on 18 bacterial strains isolated from surfaces in astromaterials cleanrooms.
WGS identified 14 Bacillus, 2 Paenibacillus, 1 Solibacillus and 1 Alcaligenes strains. These isolates showed similarity to strains commonly observed in spacecraft assembly
cleanrooms at other facilities. Cluster analysis of mass spectra generated by MALDI-TOF
grouped strains together that were greater than 94% similar to each other in terms of
amino acid sequences of single copy core genes, as assessed by WGS. This suggests that
MALDI-TOF and WGS results are consistent with each other and MALDI-TOF can
rapidly identify strains of Bacillus sp. isolated from cleanroom environments with a
resolution comparable to WGS. Based on phylogenomic analysis, these results also
suggest the presence of a cosmopolitan class of Bacillus sp. that are more likely to be
found in cleanrooms and similar built environments than in natural systems."

Observational data provided by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On satellite missions offer global TWS variation (ΔTWS) in terms of an integrated water column. However, GRACE spatial resolution is relatively coarse (i.e., 3°), and the vertically integrated value cannot be separated into ΔTWS components directly. This study demonstrates the feasibility to estimate ΔTWS components at any desired spatial-vertical resolution by effectively maintaining the native resolution of the employed hydrological knowledge. It utilizes a least-squares with constraints (LSC) approach to rigorously incorporate GRACE and GRACE-FO data and a priori hydrological knowledge, with the aim to improve global ΔTWS components’ accuracy and spatial resolution. The 3°×3° GRACE mascon derived ΔTWS data is disaggregated into the 0.5°×0.5° anomalous soil moisture storage (ΔSMS), groundwater storage (ΔGWS), snow water equivalent (ΔSWE), and surface water storage (ΔSWS) based on the covariance information obtained from the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) and the PCRaster Global Water Balance (PCR-GLOBWB) models. Evaluation with different ground measurements and satellite products between 2002 and 2019 exhibits significantly improved accuracy in all individual ΔTWS components. This improvement is of particular note in ΔGWS and ΔSWS, where the LSC approach increases the globally averaged correlation values by approximately 0.13 and 0.05, respectively. Reliable prior knowledge leads to a more accurate ΔTWS component estimate, and the use of ensemble-mean knowledge yields the best result."

We find two anomalous features in the system’s behaviour. First, the pulse profile observed by NICER during maximum luminosity is similar to that observed by XMM–Newton in 2000, despite the fact that the X-ray luminosity was different by two orders of magnitude. In contrast, a modest decrease in luminosity in the 2020 observations generated a significant change in pulse profile. Secondly, we find that the historical optical outbursts are not strictly periodic, as would be expected if the outbursts were triggered by periastron passage, as is generally assumed. The optical peaks are also not coincident with the X-ray outbursts. We suggest that this behaviour may result from a misalignment of the Be star disc and the orbital plane, which might cause changes in the timing of the passage of the neutron star through the disc as it processes. We conclude that the orbital period of the source remains unclear."

Here we report the discovery of two sub-Neptunes orbiting around TOI 1062 (TIC 299799658), a V = 10.25 G9V star observed in the TESS Sectors 1, 13, 27, and 28. We use precise radial velocity observations from HARPS to confirm and characterize these two planets. TOI 1062b has a radius of 2.265(-0.091,+0.096) Rꚛ, a mass of 10.15 ± 0.8 Mꚛ, and an orbital period of 4.1130 ± 0.0015 days. The second planet is not transiting, has a minimum mass of 9.78(−1.18,+1.26) Mꚛ and is near the 2:1 mean motion resonance with the innermost planet with an orbital period of 7.972(−0.024,+0.018) days. We performed a dynamical analysis to explore the proximity of the system to this resonance, and to attempt further constraining the orbital parameters. The transiting planet has a mean density of 4.85(−0.74,+0.84) g/cu. cm and an analysis of its internal structure reveals that it is expected to have a small volatile envelope accounting for 0.35% of the mass at most. The star’s brightness and the proximity of the inner planet to what is know as the radius gap make it an interesting candidate for transmission spectroscopy, which could further constrain the composition and internal structure of TOI 1062b."

This causes feedback between the wind and the X-ray luminosity of the compact star. 

Aims: We aim to estimate how the wind velocity on the face-on side of the donor star depends on the spectral state of the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. 

Methods: We modeled the supersonic part of the wind by computing the line force (force multiplier) with the Castor, Abbott & Klein formalism and XSTAR physics and by solving the mass conservation and momentum balance equations. We computed the line force locally in the wind considering the radiation fields from both the donor and the compact star in each spectral state. We solved the wind equations at different orbital angles from the line joining the stars and took the effect of wind clumping into account. Wind-induced accretion luminosities were estimated using the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton formalism and computed wind velocities at the compact star. We compared them to those obtained from observations. 

Results: We found that the ionization potentials of the ions contributing the most to the line force fall in the extreme-UV region(100–230 Å). If the flux in this region is high, the line force is weak, and consequently, the wind velocity is low. We found a correlation between the luminosities estimated from the observations for each spectral state of Cyg X-3 and the computed accretion luminosities assuming moderate wind clumping and a low mass of the compact star. For high wind clumping, this correlation disappears. We compared the XSTAR method used here with the comoving frame method and found that they agree reasonably well with each other. 
Conclusions. We show that soft X-rays in the extreme-UV region from the compact star penetrate the wind from the donor star and diminish the line force and consequently the wind velocity on the face-on side. This increases the computed accretion luminosities qualitatively in a similar manner as observed in the spectral evolution of Cyg X-3 for a moderate clumping volume filling factor and a compact star mass of a few (2–3) solar masses."

The NASA mission TESS is currently doing an all-sky survey from space to detect transiting planets around bright stars. As part of the validation process, the most promising planet candidates need to be confirmed and characterized using follow-up observations.

Aims. In this article, our aim is to confirm the planetary nature of the transiting planet candidate TOI-674b using spectroscopic and photometric observations.

Methods. We use TESS, Spitzer, ground-based light curves, and HARPS spectrograph radial velocity measurements to establish the physical properties of the transiting exoplanet candidate TOI-674b. We perform a joint fit of the light curves and radial velocity time series to measure the mass, radius, and orbital parameters of the candidate.

Results. We confirm and characterize TOI-674b, a low-density super-Neptune transiting a nearby M dwarf. The host star (TIC 158588995, V = 14.2 mag, J = 10.3 mag) is characterized by its M2V spectral type with M⋆ = 0.420 ± 0.010 Mꙩ, R⋆ = 0.420 ± 0.013 Rꙩ, and T(eff) = 3514 ± 57 K; it is located at a distance d = 46.16 ± 0.03 pc. Combining the available transit light curves plus radial velocity measurements and jointly fitting a circular orbit model, we find an orbital period of 1.977143 ± 3 × 10^(−6) days, a planetary radius of 5.25 ± 0.17 Rꚛ, and a mass of 23.6 ± 3.3 Mꚛ implying a mean density of ρp =0.91 ± 0.15 g/cu. cm. A non-circular orbit model fit delivers similar planetary mass and radius values within the uncertainties. Given the measured planetary radius and mass, TOI-674b is one of the largest and most massive super-Neptune class planets discovered around an M-type star to date. It is found in the Neptunian desert, and is a promising candidate for atmospheric characterization using the James Webb Space Telescope."

Using reanalysis data of liquid and ice water path as well as satellite retrievals of sea ice snow-cover depth, spectral regions are determined over which the snowfall signatures are likely to be obscured or falsely detected. Relying on an a priori database populated with the active–passive coincidences, a Bayesian snowfall retrieval algorithm is presented that links a k -nearest neighbor matching with the inverse Gaussian estimator used in the Goddard profiling algorithm. Without relying on any ancillary data of air temperature, the results demonstrate that over open oceans (sea ice), we can passively retrieve the CloudSat active snowfalls with a true positive rate of 92 (85%) and the root mean squared error of 0.24 (0.15) mm per h."

The Europa Lander mission is concerned about lowering the mass, volume, and power so that it can maximize its science return. The motor controller uses multiple Motor Control Cards to control the 24 motors that will be operating in the extremes of the Europa environment. The CAN bus was considered because of its multi-drop nature, low power interface, and simple communication protocol. Beyond communication with the motor controller cards we also use the CAN bus interface to gather telemetry from the Power Conversion Card. Our system requires the collection of telemetry at a rate of 64Hz from the Power Conversion Card and all active motor controllers along with the sending of control packets and the receipt of control parameters at 512 Hz.  In the paper we will address the ability of the CAN bus to meet these requirements along with our Arduino based test system used to learn about the CAN bus standard and verify our analysis."

They will need to operate with limited prior information about the terrain, and under varying lighting conditions. Landing safely and precisely in the face of these challenges is difficult for existing vision-based landing systems, which require detailed orbital reconnaissance, a priori hazard maps, and impose time-of-day restrictions on landing to ensure similar lighting conditions in orbital and descent imagery. Advanced 3D imaging LiDAR systems currently under development, and originally intended for single-scan hazard detection, have the potential to be operated continuously from altitudes of up to 5 km. Used together with existing inertial measurement units (IMUs), these sensors open a path-to-flight for a full navigation and mapping system, which could replace or augment a traditional landing sensor suite. A landing system based around these sensors can perform accurate altimetry, map-relative localization (MRL), LiDAR-inertial odometry, and map refinement in an illumination-insensitive manner, over unknown or partially known terrain. This paper outlines preliminary work on a LiDAR-inertial landing system that: estimates the spacecraft trajectory during entry, descent, and landing (EDL); and maps the topography of the terrain below, for future use in hazard detection and avoidance. An incremental, factor graph based, smoothing approach is used to solve for the maximum a posteriori trajectory of spacecraft states. Integrated IMU measurements and features tracked in adjacent range and intensity images are used to estimate motion (LiDAR-inertial odometry). LiDAR scans are binned into motion-corrected digital elevation models (DEMs), which are matched to an existing orbital topographic map to provide absolute position information (MRL). The estimated trajectory is then used to project the LiDAR scans into the map frame, creating a variable-resolution quadtree topographic map suitable for hazard detection and avoidance. Existing topographic maps from throughout the solar system (i.e., Earth, the Moon, Mars, Ceres, Vesta, Europa, Enceladus, and Eros) are upsampled for use in EDL simulations. The Mars 2020 Lander Vision System Simulator (LVSS) is extended to simulate LiDAR-inertial data for realistic EDL trajectories. Results of the algorithm operating on the simulated data are presented. Estimated spacecraft trajectory and refined map are compared to ground truth to assess estimation accuracy."

The COVID- 19 Pandemic presentedfurther challenges in continuing on-console training forMSL operations trainees. The MSL operations team switched tofully remote operations, thus hampering the direct mentorshipa trainee would normally receive while on site at JPL. TheMars 2020 training team had developed a concept for roveroperations training simulations based on Johnson Space Center’sextensive simulations training program for astronauts andflight controllers. The MSL team borrowed this idea, and implementedthese training simulations which are called PracticalOperational Readiness Gambits (PORGs). The PORGs so farhave focused on the Science Planner and Rover Planner roles,which are two crucial roles in tactical operations that engagein key interactions throughout a shift. PORGs are based onactual sol scenarios that have occurred on Mars and follow thetactical operations process and timeline as closely as possible.However, unlike an operations shift, PORGs can slow down orpause to allow for more mentoring time. PORGs can focus onparticular skills to test the trainees on their understanding ofa concept. PORGs increase in complexity with each scenario toease the trainees into more typical tactical operations workloads.As more trainees join the MSL operations team, more roles arebeing incorporated into PORGs. There are plans to incorporatecertified operations personnel into PORGs to practice anomalyresponse situations. PORGs have become an essential part of theMSL operations training program and will continue even afterthe return to on-site operations at JPL."

In order to reach the samples, a series of five containers would need to be opened inside of a Mars Returned Sample Handling (MRSH) facility. The process would include opening the Containment Assurance Module (CAM) aboard the Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV), the Secondary Containment Vessel (SCV), Primary Containment Vessel (PCV), and the Orbiting Sample (OS) container, and finally removing and opening the Returned Sample Tube Assemblies (RSTA). Some of these containers can be opened by reversing the mechanical assembly process while others would require destructive means. Several containers are still in a conceptual design phase while others are en route to Mars aboard the M2020 rover. In order to inform the design of the containers that are still in the conceptual stages, a study was performed at each level of the containment assembly. The studies were used to determine the least destructive and most robust methods to disassemble and open the containers while minimizing risk to the samples or the personnel. In addition to the envisioned disassembly and breaching method, contingency plans were made for completing the disassembly if damage to the vehicle and containment system occurred."

The purpose of SHIELD is to provide a low-cost option to deliver up to 6 kg of science payload to the surface of Mars. SHIELD could be launched as a hosted payload, rideshare on an EELV secondary payload adapter (ESPA), or launching from a dedicated small launch vehicle using a kick stage. The SHIELD concept can achieve low-cost access to Mars by taking advantage of a low ballistic coefficient design to decelerate safely instead of using the typically required parachutes and/or propulsion to decelerate and stabilize itself during entry, decent, and landing (EDL). Current finite element simulations suggest that SHIELD would experience an impact acceleration pulse ranging from 1000 to 2000 g’s with a duration of 8 milliseconds. The SHIELD concept payload subsystem includes a “ruggedized” small warm electronics box (WEB). The WEB houses the telecommunications, command and data handling, thermal control, electrical power, and payload subsystems while maintaining an internal operating temperature ranging between -20° to 20° C. The system is designed to survive the Martian night by utilizing electric heaters powered with solar cells during the day and secondary batteries. The WEB is designed to be impact resistant capable of surviving an impact acceleration pulse equal to or less than 2000 g’s."

In this work we present afully automatic approach to extracting software requirementsfrom design documents as well as comparing the extractedrequirements to those that exist in the official software requirementdatabase. We do this through (1) sentence extractionfrom the design document, (2) the incorporation of coreferenttext, and (3) aligning the extracted text to the official softwarerequirements. Via natural language processing and informationretrieval techniques, our system results in an automated processthat ensures that the specifications in the design document resultin official software requirements. We find that extraction ofimperatives results in a recall rate of 0.73 and the TF-IDF cosinesimilarity metric is shown to be a useful and successful way tocompare requirements.Though there has been recent work investigating the usefulnessof natural language processing techniques in requirement engineering,this has not been made use of in the aerospace industry.Aerospace requirement engineering is a field particularly ripefor this type of innovation because these techniques can bothautomate some of needlessly manual work and contribute toaerospace safety practices by identifying issues that a humanmay miss.

The received frequency contains information on the gravitational field and is also perturbed by the propagation environment, including Earth troposphere and ionosphere, electrons in the solar plasma, electrons in the Io Plasma Torus around Jupiter, and instrumental effects on both the spacecraft and the ground electronics. Each of these effects must be calibrated out of the data to ensure an accurate estimation of the Jupiter gravitational field. This work discusses the data processing, calibration, and performance of the frequency measurements. The precision of the frequency measurements average 1.1 mHz (1σ standard deviation at 60 second integration time), or 5.3 microns/sec in units of velocity. The remaining noise sources are primarily from residual troposphere and charged particles.

Autonomous spacecraft Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) on the surface of a planetary body with a degree of precision in the order of meters is highly challenging. In this paper, a successive convexification guidance algorithm is utilized to simulate autonomous precision landing sequences on Saturn’s moon Titan. Due to its unique geophysical features, studying the science of matter within Titan’s atmosphere and beneath its surface is one of NASA’s most important planetary science objectives. As part of the Space Exploration Technology Directorate, a parafoil is proposed for landing on Titan due to its cost effectiveness, ease of deployment, low mass compared to the prospective payload and capabilities of precise autonomous delivery. This paper focuses on path optimization and guidance law development for high-fidelity dynamics parafoil tuning in the dense and adverse wind atmosphere of Titan, defined as a nonlinear and nonconvex optimal control problem. The powerful successive convexification method is used to solve the problem accordingly. The algorithm is designed such that the converged solution adheres to the nonlinear dynamics and kinematics in accordance with the original formulation, while respecting the state and control constraints. The six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) simulations results show that this robust method is suitable for autonomous interplanetary applications."

The experimental data in the analyses is from a rodent model  exposed  to  ≤  15  cGy  of  individual  Galactic  Cosmic  Radiation  (GCR)  ions: 4He, 16O, 28Si, 48Ti, or 56Fe,  expected  for  a  Lunar  or  Mars  mission.  This  work  investigates  rats  at  a subject-based level and uses performance scores taken before irradiation to predict impairment in Attentional  Set-shifting  (ATSET)  data  post-irradiation.  Here,  the  worst  performing  rats  of  the control  group  define  the  impairment  thresholds  based  on  population  analyses  via  cumulative distribution functions, leading to the labeling of impairment for each subject. A significant finding is the exhibition of a dose-dependent increasing probability of impairment for 1 to 10 cGy of 28Si or 56Fe in the Simple Discrimination (SD) stage of the ATSET, and for 1 to 10 cGy of 56Fe in the Compound Discrimination (CD) stage. On a subject-based level, implementing Machine Learning (ML) classifiers such as the Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks  identifies  rats  that  have  a  higher  tendency  for  impairment  after  GCR  exposure.  The algorithms  employ  the  experimental  prescreenperformance  scores  as  multidimensional  input features to predict each rodent’s susceptibility to cognitive impairment due to space radiation exposure. The receiver operating characteristic and the precision-recall curves of the ML models show a better prediction of impairment when 56Feis the ion in question in both SD and CD stages. They, however, do not depict impairment due to 4Hein SD and 28Siin CD, suggesting no dose-dependent  impairment  response  in  these  cases.  One  key  finding  of  our  study  is  that prescreen performance  scores  can  be  used  to  predict  the  ATSET  performance  impairments.  This  result  is significant  to  crewed  space  missions  as  it  supports  the  potential  of  predicting  an  astronaut’s impairment  in  a  specific  task  before  spaceflight  through  the  implementation  of  appropriately trained ML tools. Future research can focus on constructing ML ensemble methods to integrate the  findings  from  the  methodologies  implemented  in  this  study for  morerobust  predictionsof cognitive decrements due to space radiation exposure."

The revolutionary potential poses a commensurate challenge: creating contiguous maps free from regional biases induced by atmosphere, observation geometry, or inversion error. This will require an accurate calibration with precise knowledge of each channel's spectral response. Here, we quantify the impact of spectral calibration on SBG's aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem objectives. We find that contemporary algorithms for ecosystem trait retrieval demand more accurate spectral calibration than historical missions. Errors due to drift or spatial nonuniformity in the wavelength calibration that have previously been considered acceptable can cause systematic errors larger than the instrument noise and of the same order as the variability SBG aims to measure. Moreover, their impact on atmospheric correction can induce climate-dependent systematic errors that thwart comparisons between ecosystems. These results underscore the importance of spectral response accuracy in SBG mission design."

Based on the work of Mauche et al., we conjectured that the strong UV field of ζ Puppis produces the observed ratio by depopulation of metastable 3s excited states, and that the ratio can potentially be used as an independent diagnostic of plasma formation radius. We used the Flexible Atomic Code collisional-radiative model to model the effect of UV photoexcitation from O stars on the Fe xvii lines. We compared our model calculations to archival spectra of coronal and hot stars from the Chandra HETGS and XMM-Newton RGS to benchmark our calculations for various electron densities and UV field intensities. Our calculations show that UV photoexcitation does not produce a sufficiently large dynamic range in the 3F / (3F + 3G + M2) fraction to explain the difference in the observed ratio between coronal stars and ζ Pup. Thus, this effect likely cannot explain the observed line ratio of ζ Pup, and its origin is still unexplained."

Nominally, SD calibrations alternate between two configurations: screen open and screen closed. Terra MODIS, however, experienced an anomaly in 2003, which has left the SD door and screen in a permanent open-closed configuration. This resulted in accelerated degradation of the SD on Terra MODIS due to the direct solar radiation exposure every orbit. It also led to an unexpected divergence between the calibration coefficients, m1, or the inverse of the gain, generated using SD data and those generated using lunar observations at the time of the 2003 anomaly. This paper examines the effect of the screen configuration on the Terra SD degradation by analyzing Terra SDSM data and comparing to Aqua. We generate “pseudo-open” Terra SDSM data by modeling the ratio of Aqua screen open and screen closed SDSM data and calculate the Terra SD degradation using this new screen open data. We then examine the effects on our m1 values calculated using this new pseudo-open SD degradation for Terra. Implementing this new degradation results in a smaller discrepancy between the lunar and SD m1 values after the door anomaly, indicating that there may be a systematic error in the SD degradation calculated with screen closed data."

Radiative transfer (RT) models have the potential to provide a better understanding of the canopy structural effects on the SIF emission and RS signals. Here, we used the DART model to assess the daily influence, from morning to evening, of forest 3D architecture on SIF nadir radiance, emission, escape factor and nadir yield of eight 100 m × 100 m forest study plots established in a temperate deciduous forest of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (Edgewater, MD, USA). The 3D architecture of each plot was derived from airborne LiDAR. DART simulations of these 3D forest plots and their 1D (i.e., vertical profile of sun-adapted and shade-adapted leaves) and 0D (i.e., homogeneous layer of sun-adapted leaves above an homogeneous layer of shade-adapted leaves) abstractions were compared to assess the relative errors (ε1D−3D and ε0D−3D) associated with horizontal and vertical structural heterogeneity, respectively. Forest 3D structure, especially horizontal heterogeneity, had a great influence on forest nadir SIF radiance, resulting in ε1D−3D up to 55% at 8:00 and 18:00 (i.e., for oblique sun directions). The key indicators of this impact, in the descending order of importance, were the SIF escape factor (ε1D−3D up to 40%), the attenuation of incident photosynthetically active radiation (ε1D−3D less than 5%), and the SIF emission yield (ε1D−3D less than 2%). The influence of forest architecture on the nadir SIF escape factor and SIF yield (ε1D−3D up to 40%) varied over time, with differences in forest stand structure, and per spectral domain, being always larger between 640 and 700 nm than between 700 and 850 nm. In addition, woody elements demonstrated a large influence on forest SIF radiance due to their “shading” effect (ε up to 17%) and their “blocking” effect (ε ≈ 10%), both of them higher for far-red than for red SIF. These results underline the importance of 3D forest canopy architecture, especially 2D heterogeneity, and inclusion of woody elements in RT modeling used for interpretation of the RS SIF signal, and subsequently for the estimation of gross primary production and detection of vegetation stress."

Remotely sensed SIF integrates environmental, physiological and structural changes that alter photosynthesis at leaf, plant and canopy scales. Radiative transfer models are ideally suited to investigate the complex sources of variability in the SIF signal to guide the interpretation of SIF retrievals from airborne and space-borne platforms. Here, we coupled the Fluspect-Cx model of leaf optical properties and chlorophyll-a fluorescence with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to upscale SIF from individual leaves to three-dimensional (3D) structurally explicit canopies. For one-dimensional homogeneous (turbid-like) canopies, DART-SIF was nearly identical to SIF simulated in two existing models, SCOPE and mSCOPE (RMSE <0.221 W./sq.m.μm.sr). DART simulations in geometrically explicit 3D canopies offered four important insights regarding the influence of vegetation structure on the multi-angular top-of-canopy SIF signal. First, changes in the 3D canopy architecture of maize crops, represented by leaf density (leaf area index), and plant clumping (canopy closure) had a larger impact on SIF than the modelled photosynthetic efficiency distinction between sun-adapted and shade-adapted foliage. Second, clumping of leaves at the crop and stand levels was identified as one of the key driving factors of multi-angular anisotropy of red and far-red SIF (686 and 740 nm) for both maize and eucalyptus canopies. Third, non-photosynthetic woody material had a significant impact on top-of-canopy SIF in modelled 3D forest stands. Wood shadowing decreased the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green leaves, and consequently the SIF emissions, by 10% in sparse and 17% in dense eucalyptus stands. The wood obstruction (blocking) effect, quantified as a relative difference of SIF escape probabilities from canopies with and without wood in the nadir viewing direction, decreased far-red SIF by 4–6% but it had a smaller and sometimes positive influence (by less than 2%) on red SIF. Fourth, DART 3D radiative budget profiles revealed that the majority of the SIF signal from a dense eucalyptus stand originated from the top 25% of the simulated canopy. Interestingly, the introduction of bark-covered woody elements did not alter the simulated balance and omnidirectional escape factor of red SIF in this upper canopy part but did raise significantly both of them in case of far-red SIF. These results demonstrate the importance of 3D radiative transfer and radiative budget simulations for investigating SIF interactions in structurally complex plant canopies and for a better understanding of spatiotemporal and multi-angular remote sensing SIF observations."

Within this limited range, Venus flytrap populations are threatened by habitat loss, fire suppression, and poaching. NASA DEVELOP partnered with the North Carolina Botanical Garden (NCBG), the University of North Carolina Herbarium (NCU), and the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program (NCNHP) to support Venus flytrap conservation. The team developed models based on species presence data and environmental variables using the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) to create a 2021 habitat suitability map for Venus flytrap. These models incorporated Earth observations collected by Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI). To predict areas at high risk of development, the team produced a 2050 land-use change map using TerrSet Land Change Modeler. The team found potential areas of conflict between predicted habitat and forecasted future development. Many areas of suitable habitat were concentrated along the coast where development was likely to occur, placing populations there at risk of extirpation. Overlaying suitable habitat with forecasted land change also identified suitable habitats with minimal risk of development, which may serve as lasting Venus flytrap habitat. These results can inform the NCBG and NCNHP’s conservation decision-making, including targeted seed banking, reintroduction, and prioritization of enduring habitats for protection and management."

Direct Measurements of the Earth,"NASA’s EPOXI mission used the Deep Impact spacecraft to observe the disk-integrated Earth as an analog to terrestrial exoplanets’ appearance. The mission took five 24 hr observations in 2008–2009 at various phase angles(57°.7–86°.4)and ranges(0.11–0.34 au), of which three equatorial(E1, E4, E5)and two polar(P1, North and P2,South). The visible data taken by the HRIV instrument ranges from 0.3 to 1.0μm, taken trough seven spectral filters that have spectral widths of about 100 nm, and which are centered about 100 nm apart, from 350 to 950 nm. The disk-integrated, 24 hr averaged signal is used in a phase angle analysis. A Lambertian-reflecting, spherical planet model is used to estimate geometric albedo for every observation and wavelength. The geometric albedos range from 0.143(E1, 950 nm)to 0.353(P2, 350 nm)and show wavelength dependence. The equatorial observations have similar values, while the polar observations have higher values due to the ice in view. Therefore, equatorial observations can be predicted for other phase angles, but(Earth-like)polar views(with ice)would be underestimated."

Since then, INTEGRAL has been providing long, uninterrupted observations (up to about 47  h, or 170  ksec, per satellite orbit of 2.7 days) with a large field-of-view (FOV, fully coded: 100 deg), millisecond time resolution, keV energy resolution, polarization measurements, as well as additional wavelength coverage at optical wavelengths. This is realized by two main instruments in the 15  keV to 10  MeV energy range, the spectrometer SPI (spectral resolution 3 keV at 1.8  MeV) and the imager IBIS (angular resolution: 12 arcmin FWHM), complemented by X-ray (JEM-X; 3–35  keV) and optical (OMC; Johnson V-band) monitor instruments. All instruments are co-aligned to simultaneously observe the target region. A particle radiation monitor (IREM) measures charged particle fluxes near the spacecraft. The Anti-coincidence subsystems of the main instruments, built to reduce the background, are also very efficient all-sky γ-ray detectors, which provide virtually omni-directional monitoring above ~75  keV. Besides the long, scheduled observations, INTEGRAL can rapidly (within a couple of hours) re-point and conduct Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations on a large variety of sources.

INTEGRAL observations and their scientific results have been building an impressive legacy: The discovery of currently more than 600 new high-energy sources; the first-ever direct detection of (56)Ni and (56)Co radio-active decay lines from a Type Ia supernova; spectroscopy of isotopes from galactic nucleo-synthesis sources; new insights on enigmatic positron annihilation in the Galactic bulge and disk; and pioneering gamma-ray polarization studies. INTEGRAL is also a successful actor in the new multi-messenger astronomy introduced by non-electromagnetic signals from gravitational waves and from neutrinos: INTEGRAL found the first prompt electromagnetic radiation in coincidence with a binary neutron star merger.

Up to now more than 1750 scientific papers based on INTEGRAL data have been published in refereed journals. In this paper, we will give a comprehensive update of the satellite status after more than 18 years of operations in a harsh space environment, and an account of the successful Ground Segment."

form of a power law in addition to the standard black body (0.1–10 keV) and Comptonization (10–200 keV) components observed
by INTEGRAL in several black-hole X-ray binaries. This so-called “high-energy tail” was recently shown to be strong in the hard
spectral state of Cygnus X-1, and, in this system, has been interpreted as the high-energy part of the emission from a compact jet.
Aims. This result was nevertheless obtained from a data set largely dominated by hard state observations. In the soft state, only upper
limits on the presence and hence the potential parameters of a high-energy tail could be derived. Using an extended data set, we aim
to obtain better constraints on the properties of this spectral component in both states.

Methods. We make use of data obtained from about 15 years of observations with the INTEGRAL satellite. The data set is separated
into the different states and we analyze stacked state-resolved spectra obtained from the X-ray monitors, the gamma-ray imager, and
the gamma-ray spectrometer (SPI) onboard.

Results. A high-energy component is detected in both states, confirming its earlier detection in the hard state and its suspected
presence in the soft state with INTEGRAL, as seen in a much smaller SPI data set. We first characterize the high-energy tail components in the two states through a model-independent, phenomenological analysis. We then apply physical models based on hybrid Comptonization (eqpair and belm). The spectra are well modeled in all cases, with a similar goodness of the fits. While in the
semi-phenomenological approach the high-energy tail has similar indices in both states, the fits with the physical models seem to
indicate slightly different properties. Based on this approach, we discuss the potential origins of the high-energy components in both
the soft and hard states, and favor an interpretation where the high-energy component is due to a compact jet in the hard state and
hybrid Comptonization in either a magnetized or nonmagnetized corona in the soft state."

In the summer of 2018, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) measured unexpected spikes in O3 in Seiling, Oklahoma, with concentrations exceeding those measured in bustling Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The DEQ tracks air quality using ground monitors and does not utilize Earth observation data in its monitoring or analysis. This project used remotely sensed data to investigate these2018 air quality anomalies, identifying possible causes. We analyzed atmospheric data from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel-5P Tropospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) in conjunction with ground-based measurements of tropospheric ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD). We compared Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model simulations and Earth observation visualizations to pinpoint ozone spike causes. We also generated models to identify contributing factors to variations in ground ozone concentrations in our study area. The results point to a variety of ozone spike causes, primarily from outside of the state, and support the placement of additionalNO2, O3, and CO monitors to the southeast of Seiling. These analyses can help guide the placement of future monitors in the ground monitoring network and inform air quality regulations in Oklahoma."

Simulations predict that planets in Jupiter-like orbits around stars of ≲8 Mꙩ (solar mass) avoid being destroyed by the strong tidal forces of their stellar host, but as yet, there has been no observational confirmation of such a survivor. Here we report the non-detection of a main-sequence lens star in the microlensing event MOA-2010-BLG-477Lb using near-infrared observations from the Keck Observatory. We determine that this system contains a 0.53 ± 0.11 Mꙩ white-dwarf host orbited by a 1.4 ± 0.3 Jupiter-mass planet with a separation on the plane of the sky of 2.8 ± 0.5 astronomical units, which implies a semi-major axis larger than this. This system is evidence that planets around white dwarfs can survive the giant and asymptotic giant phases of their host’s evolution, and supports the prediction that more than half of white dwarfs have Jovian planetary companions.

Missing datais often countered by deleting entire observations that containmissing data. The negative effects of deleting entire observationsare multiple: deleting observations reduces sample size andcan also result in biased inferences even if data is missing atrandom. In addition, knowledge contained within incompleteobservations is knowledge lost when they are deleted– and theeffort spent collecting that knowledge is effort wasted. Data imputationmethods, or methods of statistically “filling-in” missingdata, can help combat small sample sizes by using the existinginformation in partially complete observations with the end goalof producing less biased and higher confidence inferences. Whena sample from a multivariate normal population is only partiallycomplete, and the missing data meets appropriate assumptions(missing at random), robust data imputation of the missing datacan be implemented with monotone data augmentation (MDA)using the multivariate t distribution.Missing data imputation is applied to data from the NASA InstrumentCost Model (NICM) using the MDA algorithm underthe assumption of having a multivariate t distribution with fixeddegrees of freedom.

The success and sustainability of Team-X over the 25 years that have followed is directly attributable to the Team-X business model and its evolution over time. While dozens of organizations and institutions have emulated the Team-X design process, there are nuances to the Team-X business model that are unique to JPL, and explain why it is different than other concurrent design teams.  One of the key components of a business model is the customer segments that are served. Team-X was founded to conduct the Pre-Phase A work necessary to formulate a portfolio of multiple planetary mission concepts, but has since expanded to include the capability to conduct studies for Earth science, astrophysics, and heliophysics missions as well as Human Exploration and Operations missions and space technology development. Team-X delivers value to its clients both in terms of speed and cost. Team-X has also added value by creating teams to enable the development of Instrument and SmallSat Concepts.  Value has further been enhanced through a revision of its process for reviews and the addition of pre-design architecting capabilities. Other aspects of the Team-X infrastructure, in addition to study process, have enabled it to succeed for over a quarter century. From our most important resource, the people, our tools, especially for cost estimating, as well as our increasing capable IT infrastructure have contributed to our capability to meet the demands of our clients.

However, the mole’s downward progress stopped after only 35 cm of penetration. In response, the project convened an Anomaly Response Team (ART) and since then has been attempting to diagnose the problem and assist the mole using the tools available on Mars. The key asset used in this effort has been the Instrument Deployment System (IDS), which includes two cameras and a robotic Instrument Deployment Arm (IDA). Since the IDS was originally intended only to deploy InSight’s primary instruments to the Martian surface, new testbed setups, experiments, and operational protocols (e.g., command sequences) were required and had to be developed on a short timeline. The HP3 Mole ART first focused on gathering all observable data on Mars about the state of the mole and Support Structure Assembly (SSA), as well as the physical properties of the Martian regolith. This included using the robotic arm to point the IDC (Instrument Deployment Camera) at the SSA during diagnostic hammering attempts to observe motion of the SSA and science tether. Images taken during these attempts revealed some motion of the SSA, but no apparent change in mole depth. At JPL, the IDS and Testbed teams re-created the hardware configuration on Mars based on limited knowledge of the mole’s state. They devised and tested techniques to use the robotic arm and cameras to accomplish previously untested activities on Mars, including imaging the HP3 , using the IDA to interact with the terrain, and using the IDA to move the SSA away from the partially-embedded mole. The team executed the more promising techniques on Mars. After diagnostic hammering on Mars, the team decided to move the SSA to gain visibility of the mole’s configuration and access to the soil around the mole. After developing the technique and practicing the maneuver in the InSight testbed, the team lifted the SSA on Mars and placed it behind the mole. This revealed a pit surrounding the now exposed mole, observations of which provided essential clues for determining the root cause of the mole’s lack of progress. The IDS and Testbed teams altered the testbed to match the situation on Mars. They devised IDA techniques to determine the Martian soil properties and assist the mole’s descent. They tested these techniques in the testbed and executed the more promising ones on Mars. These include using the robotic arm to alter the regolith near the mole and to push on the mole while it hammers. This paper discusses the anomaly resolution testing in the testbed at JPL, describes how the IDS team prepared for the anomaly recovery activities on Mars, and provides preliminary results of the efforts to assist the HP3 mole on Mars."

The horizontal scale size measured by small-scale TEC spatial rate (STSR, in TECU/km), including its latitude and longitude components, ranges from about 1.8 km to 15 km at 450 km altitude. The medium-scale TEC gradient components can be derived from global ionospheric map (GIM) based TEC gradient (GBTG) over about 110 km horizontally at low and middle latitudes, with smaller scale lengths in the longitude component in the polar region. Our analyses of GPS data show that the latitude component of STSR and GBTG is much larger than the longitude component. The spatial rates in most regions of the globe are relatively small, and their absolute mean values are mostly under 0.03 TECU/km. However, STSR is substantially larger, often greater than 0.05 TECU/km, in the equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA) region than in other regions, or when ionospheric disturbances occur. The disturbances include ionospheric irregularities, significant changes of regional ionospheric state during space weather events, and traveling ionospheric disturbances. Combined global TEC gradient (CGTG) with STSR and GBTG is also shown in this paper as snapshots using data from networks of more than three thousand GNSS receivers. The comparisons between STSR and GBTG indicate that their regional variation patterns are consistent though STSR is often larger than GBTG in the equatorial anomaly region or during ionospheric disturbances particularly during space weather events. The difference is attributed to the fact that the global TEC mapping technique may smooth the gradient in regions where spatial variations are large at small- and medium scales."

The aerocapture guidance method described in this paper uses drag modulation, which deploys a drag skirt in the atmosphere until the amount of delta-V needed to capture into the desired orbit is obtained, at which time the drag skirt is separated from the spacecraft. By modulating the time of drag skirt jettison, the vehicle can target a specific orbit apoapsis in the presence of uncertainties such as entry targeting errors and unknown atmospheric conditions."

Validation with independent data of this change in tides, as well as the proposed cause, has been lacking Ocean tides also generate magnetic fields that reach far outside the ocean, and tidal signals are clearly seen in the hourly data since 1905 from the Honolulu geomagnetic observatory. Here, it is found that the tidal amplitudes have increased synchronously in the tide-gauge and magnetic records, providing independent support for the previous results. Further information about the changing ocean is likely contained in the historical data from geomagnetic observatories as well as the global coverage of modern satellite magnetic surveys."

In the considered measurements, whistlers propagate both parallel and antiparallel to the background magnetic field B0 with frequencies around 100 Hz (0.15 fce, where fce is the electron cyclotron frequency) and amplitudes between 0.1 and 1 nT. Their growth can be attributed to localized pitch angle anisotropy in the electron velocity distribution function that cannot be precisely described by macroscopic parameters like heat flux or temperature anisotropy. However, the presence of heat flux along −B0 does create preferential conditions for the high-frequency whistler waves that propagate in this direction. These waves are directed partially toward the shock, meaning they can scatter electrons that are streaming from the shock. This prolongs the time the electrons spend in the shock transition region and thereby promotes electron energization."

OCO-3 measures atmospheric carbon dioxide from space. Made from the spare instrument built as a backup to the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), OCO-3 extends the rich set of data collected by OCO-2. OCO-3 is outfitted with an agile Pointing Mirror Assembly (PMA) that allows for more detailed types of observations and rapid mode transitions. The mission uses an adaptation of the Compressed Large-scale Activity Scheduling and Planning (CLASP) system for scheduling nominal operations, as well as a separate automated scheduling system developed for scheduling observations for the calibration of the PMA. CLASP is used to schedule the four types of observational modes: Nadir, Glint, Target, and Snapshot Area Map. OCO-3 has a variety of complex mission-specific geometric constraints that were incorporated into CLASP to produce schedules that ensure instrument safety."

The high operating temperature (HOT) BIRD focal plane arrays (FPAs) offer the same high performance, uniformity, operability, manufacturability, and affordability advantages as InSb. However, mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) HOT-BIRD FPAs can operate at significantly higher temperatures (>150K) than InSb FPAs (typically 80K). Moreover, while InSb has a fixed cutoff wavelength (~5.4 µm), the HOT-BIRD offers a continuous adjustable cutoff wavelength, ranging from ~4 µm to >15 µm, and is therefore also suitable for long wavelength infrared (LWIR) as well. The LWIR detectors based on the BIRD architecture has also demonstrated significant operating temperature advantages over those based on traditional p-n junction designs. Two 6U SmalSat missions CIRAS (Cubesat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder) and HyTI (Hyperspectral Thermal Imager) are based on JPL’s T2SL BIRD focal plane arrays (FPAs). Based on III-V compound semiconductors, the BIRD FPAs offer a breakthrough solution for the realization of low cost (high yield), high-performance FPAs with excellent uniformity and pixel-to-pixel operability. We have also exploring the possibilities of integrating either metasurface resonator cavity or metasurface based flatlens with individual pixels to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the detectors. Furthermore, we will discuss the advantages of the utilization of all digital read out integrated circuits with HOT-BIRDs."

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), which maps global AGBD from waveform lidar, is the first of a new generation of Earth observation missions designed to improve carbon accounting. This paper explores the possibility that lidar waveforms may not be unique to AGBD—that forest stands with different AGBD may produce highly similar waveforms—and we hypothesize that non-uniqueness may contribute to the large uncertainties in AGBD predictions. Our analysis integrates simulated GEDI waveforms from 428 in situ stem maps with output from an individual-based forest gap model, which we use to generate a database of potential forest stands and simulate GEDI waveforms from those stands. We use this database to predict the AGBD of the 428 in situ stem maps via two different methods: a linear regression from waveform metrics, and a waveform-matching approach that accounts for waveform-AGBD non-uniqueness. We find that some in situ waveforms are more unique to AGBD than others, which notably impacts AGBD prediction uncertainty (7–411 Mg ha−1, average of 167 Mg ha−1). We also find that forest structure complexity may influence the non-uniqueness effect; stands with low structural complexity are more unique to AGBD than more mature stands with multiple cohorts and canopy layers. These findings suggest that the non-uniqueness phenomena may be introduced by the measuring characteristics of waveform lidar in combination with how forest structure manifests at small scales, and we discuss how this complexity may complicate uncertainty estimation in AGBD prediction. This analysis suggests a limit to the accuracy and precision of AGBD predictions from lidar waveforms seen in empirical studies, and underscores the need for further exploration of the relationships between lidar remote sensing measurements, forest structure, and AGBD."

The level of uncertainty in net LUC flux from process-based models is so high that it cannot be concluded that newer estimates are necessarily more reliable than older ones. Here, we examined net LUC flux estimates of Southeast Asia for the 1980s−2010s from older and newer sets of Dynamic Global Vegetation Model simulations (TRENDY v2 and v7, respectively), and forcing data used for running those simulations, along with two book-keeping estimates (H&N and BLUE). These estimates yielded two contrasting historical LUC transitions, such that TRENDY v2 and H&N showed a transition from increased emissions from the 1980s to 1990s to declining emissions in the 2000s, while TRENDY v7 and BLUE showed the opposite transition. We found that these contrasting transitions originated in the update of LUC forcing data, which reduced the loss of forest area during the 1990s. Further evaluation of remote sensing studies, atmospheric inversions, and the history of forestry and environmental policies in Southeast Asia supported the occurrence of peak emissions in the 1990s and declining thereafter. However, whether LUC emissions continue to decline in Southeast Asia remains uncertain as key processes in recent years, such as conversion of peat forest to oil-palm plantation, are yet to be represented in the forcing data, suggesting a need for further revision."

A key uncertainty is how forests will respond to (resistance) and recover from (resilience) rising levels of disturbance of varying intensities. This knowledge gap can optimally be addressed by integrating manipulative field experiments with ecophysiological modeling. We used the Ecosystem Demography-2.2 (ED-2.2)model to project carbon fluxes for a northern temperate deciduous forest subjected to a real-world disturbance severity manipulation experiment. ED-2.2 was run for 150 years, starting from near bare ground in 1900(approximating the clear-cut conditions at the time),and subjected to three disturbance treatments under an ensemble of climate conditions. Both disturbance severity and climate strongly affected carbon fluxes such as gross primary production (GPP),and interacted with one another. We then calculated resistance and resilience, two dimensions of ecosystem stability. Modeled GPP exhibited a two-fold decrease in mean resistance across disturbance severities of 45%, 65%, and 85% mortality; conversely, resilience increased by a factor of two with increasing disturbance severity. This pattern held for net primary production and net ecosystem production, indicating a trade-off in which greater initial declines were followed by faster recovery. Notably, however, heterotrophic respiration responded more slowly to disturbance, and its highly variable response was affected by different drivers. This work provides insight into how future conditions might affect the functional stability of mature forests in this region under ongoing climate change and changing disturbance regimes."

It remains uncertain to what extent temperature and water availability can explain these variations at the global scale. Here we use factorial climate model simulations and show that variability in soil moisture drives 90% of the inter-annual variability in global land carbon uptake, mainly through its impact on photosynthesis. We find that most of this ecosystem response occurs indirectly as soil moisture–atmosphere feedbacks amplify temperature and humidity anomalies, and enhance the direct effects of soil water stress. The strength of this feedback mechanism explains why coupled climate models indicate a dominant role of soil moisture which is not readily apparent in land surface model simulations and observational analyses. These findings highlight the need to account for feedbacks between soil and atmospheric dryness when estimating the carbon cycle’s response to climatic change globally, as well as when conducting field-scale investigations of the ecosystem response to droughts. Our results show that most of the global variability in modelled land carbon uptake is driven by temperature and vapour pressure deficit effects which are controlled by soil moisture."

Complexes with different partners frequently exhibit distinct binding modes, involving regions that remain disordered in the bound state. While the conformational properties of disordered proteins are well-characterized in their free states, less is known about the molecular mechanisms by which specificity can be achieved not with one but with multiple partners. Using the energy landscape theory concept of protein frustration, we demonstrate that complexes of disordered proteins exhibit a high degree of local frustration, especially at the binding interface. These suboptimal interactions lead to the possibility of multiple bound substates, each displaying distinct frustration patterns, which are differently populated in complexes with different partners. These results explain how specificity of disordered proteins can be achieved without a single common bound conformation and how the conflict between different interactions can be used to control the binding to multiple partners."

We used europium anomalies in detrital zircons to track mountain-building processes over Earth’s history. We show that the average thickness of active continental crust varied on billion-year time scales, with the thickest crust formed in the Archean and Phanerozoic. By contrast, the Proterozoic witnessed continuously decreasing crustal thickness, leaving the continents devoid of high mountains until the end of the eon. We link this gradually diminished orogenesis to the long-lived Nuna-Rodinia supercontinent, which altered the mantle thermal structure and weakened the continental lithosphere. This prolonged orogenic quiescence may have resulted in a persistent famine in the oceans and stalled life’s evolution in Earth’s middle age."

The design utilizes a two-stage, single-phase mechanically pumped fluid loop coupled through a two-axis flexible rotary fluid hinge, to reject thermal power to a deployable tracking radiator. A COTS Ricor K508N cryocooler forms the second stage and provides cryogenic cooling to a custom Kevlar detector mount through a TMT pyrolytic graphene thermal strap. Passive vibration isolation and damping technologies prevent the transfer of jitter to the satellite systems. The ATA design utilizes state-of-the-art 3D fabrication techniques such as Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) to directly embed the working fluid channels into the HX, radiator, and CubeSat chassis allowing for the miniaturization and simplification of the ATA system into an integrated thermal control solution. This paper will focus on the design and ground-based characterization and qualification of the ATA system and provide performance metrics for its use as a thermal support subsystem for advanced infrared electro-optical CubeSat payloads. The ATA project is funded through a NASA Small Satellite Technology Program (SSTP) and is a partnership between the Center for Space Engineering at Utah State University and the Jet Propulsions Laboratory. The ATA active thermal control system has been raised to a TRL of 6 and hopes to provide payload support to advanced missions such as the SABER-Lite and JPL CIRAS projects."
1255,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230006949,2023-08-03,Development of the Sample Fetch Rover Locomotion Subsystem,"A novel system for planetary surface mobility is being designed in response to the challenging requirements of the Sample Fetch Rover (SFR) mission, part of the NASA/ESA Mars Sample Return campaign (MSR). The rover will retrieve tubes with rock and soil samples, previously acquired and cached by NASA’s Perseverance rover in depots on the Martian surface. SFR will have to acquire, transport and deliver the tubes to a lander in a tight time window. This will require significant mobility capabilities, unprecedented for Mars rovers. The highly time-constrained traverse needs, together with the strictly limited mass and volume imposed by the accommodation on the lander, have pushed the design of the SFR locomotion to seek innovative solutions. In response to that, a four-wheel drive system is being developed, integrated with a deployable pitch-averaging suspension. This will be the first time that four-wheel locomotion is used on Mars and on robotic planetary rovers in general. The system, relying on high-efficiency drive actuators designed to operate in Mars environment, shows potential for terrain and obstacle negotiation performance comparable with that of larger vehicles. The implementation also takes advantage of the superelastic Spring-Tyre technology currently being developed by NASA Glenn Research Center, which, thanks to its traction and obstacle compliance properties, will allow SFR to navigate difficult ground and achieve its mission objectives."
1256,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230006953,2023-08-03,Mid-Wavelength and Long-Wavelength Infrared Focal Planes for SmallSat Applications,"In this presentation, we will report our recent efforts in achieving high performance in Antimonides type-II superlattice (T2SL) based infrared photodetectors using the barrier infrared detector (BIRD) architecture. The high operating temperature (HOT) BIRD focal plane arrays (FPAs) offer the same high performance, uniformity, operability, manufacturability, and affordability advantages as InSb. However, mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) HOT-BIRD FPAs can operate at significantly higher temperatures (>150K) than InSb FPAs (typically 80K). Moreover, while InSb has a fixed cutoff wavelength (~5.4 µm), the HOT-BIRD offers a continuous adjustable cutoff wavelength, ranging from ~4 µm to >15 µm, and is therefore also suitable for long wavelength infrared (LWIR) as well. The LWIR detectors based on the BIRD architecture has also demonstrated significant operating temperature advantages over those based on traditional p-n junction designs. Two 6U SmalSat missions CIRAS (Cubesat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder) and HyTI (Hyperspectral Thermal Imager) are based on JPL’s T2SL BIRD focal plane arrays (FPAs). Based on III-V compound semiconductors, the BIRD FPAs offer a breakthrough solution for the realization of low cost (high yield), high-performance FPAs with excellent uniformity and pixel-to-pixel operability. We have also exploring the possibilities of integrating either metasurface resonator cavity or metasurface based flatlens with individual pixels to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the detectors. Furthermore, we will discuss the advantages of the utilization of all digital read out integrated circuits with HOT-BIRDs."

After some station reconfiguration, carrier/telemetry were locked at both Deep Space Network (DSN) Canberra and Goldstone stations. Perseverance entered the Martian atmosphere at 20:36:50 Spacecraft Event Time (SCET) UTC, and landed inside Jezero Crater at 20:43:49 SCET UTC on February 18, 2021. Confirmation of nominal landing was received at the DSN Goldstone and Madrid tracking stations via the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter at 20:55:11 Earth Received Time (ERT) UTC. This paper summarizes in detail the actual vs. predicted performance in terms of launch vehicle events, launch vehicle injection performance, actual DSN spacecraft lockup, trajectory correction maneuver performance, Entry, Descent, and Landing events, and overall trajectory and geometric characteristics."

Planned for launch in 2023 for a 3-year mission, the MAIA satellite instrument will focus on a selected set of metropolitan target areas, where air quality monitors and health data are available. Aerosol concentration and speciation are inferred from multi-angle measurements of backscattered sunlight in 14 spectral bands from 350-2200 nm, with bands near 442, 645 and 1040 nm measuring the degree (DoLP) and angle of linear polarization (AoLP) in addition to radiance. The pushbroom camera has a ~240-km cross-track field of view with a nadir resolution of ~200 m, and is mounted onto a biaxial gimbal to provide along-track view angles within ±60°, to extend the field of regard to ±48°, and to view the instrument’s onboard calibrator (OBC) and dark target. The OBC consists of a sunlit transmissive diffuser, followed by 12 polarizers at different orientations. MAIA’s polarimetry is implemented using miniature wire grid polarizers on the focal plane array, and dual photoelastic modulators (PEMs) and achromatic quarter-wave plates to rapidly rotate the polarization. The resulting ~26-Hz intensity modulation encodes the linearly polarized and total radiance in each pixel, leaving the DoLP and AoLP insensitive to gain calibration. We report on the polarimetric calibration of the MAIA camera using a vacuum-compatible polarization state generator, consisting of a 1600W Xenon lamp, 12-inch integrating sphere, and rotating high-extinction polarizer. Mueller-matrix-based calibration coefficients for each detector pixel are derived from measurements at multiple polarizer angles, and are used to correct the measurements for instrumental polarization aberrations. Prior to flight, the calibrated MAIA camera is panned across the OBC to characterize its output, using uniform illumination with an irradiance similar to the Sun."

This method has been successfully employed on numerous high-energy trajectories, but may not be valid for low-energy ones due to the highly non-linear environment. We explore nonlinear navigational techniques applied to a Europa Lander concept by assessing trajectory sensitivity. The linearity assumption is tested at different phases of the endgame trajectory. Maneuver strategies and placement are considered to improve the delivery to Europa. Several cases of non-linear statistical maneuver Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to optimize maneuvers and compare ∆V statistics against conventional linear simulations."

With this modification, MRPPO is used to recover various low-thrust transfers between two periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon circular restricted three-body problem to solve a multi-objective optimization problem. These results are then compared with the solutions recovered via a gradient descent optimization scheme to validate the performance of MRPPO with the moving reference modification."

They mitigate optical aberrations in the system and can even be used to generate contrast for the coronagraph. MEMS DMs from Boston Micromachines have been selected as the baseline for two flagship space telescopes proposed to the 2020 Decadal Survey. Although MEMS DMs have over a decade of heritage on ground-based telescopes and in in-air testbeds around the globe, they have not been tested in vacuum down to the ∼10−10 contrast level needed to image terrestrial exoplanets. In this paper, we describe vacuum tests of MEMS DMs in the Decadal Survey Testbed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The first challenge was a bright, temporally incoherent signal, which was identified as electronics noise and removed with a low-pass filter. After that, the contrast has been limited in broadband light by the strong print-through on the DM surfaces. We performed numerical simulations to confirm that conclusion and to characterize the improvements needed to the MEMS DM surfaces and the testbed layout to attain our goal of 10−10 contrast."

This paper examines the spatial dependence of ionospheric disturbances that have threatened the accuracy and reliability of position estimates derived from these data over the period 2000 – 2019. We address two distinct aspects of this spatial dependence: (1) the geographic distribution of these threats, in particular, in relation to geomagnetic latitude, and (2) the geometric dependence of threats relative to the locations of the receiver sites that comprise the WAAS network. We analyze threat distributions in terms of the various means that WAAS employs to mitigate these threats, including the Extreme Storm Detector, the Moderate Storm Detector, local irregularity detectors, and the ionospheric threat model. Distinct distributions are presented for threats occurring in Solar Cycle 23 and those of Solar Cycle 24. To study the geometric dependence of threats on receiver locations, we use as a metric the distance separating a threat from the centroid of the nearest Ncentroid receivers. Large values of this metric identify threats at or beyond the edge of coverage. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for WAAS operations."

Buoyancy-controlled vehicles, which control their verticalposition in the water column but have no means of horizontalpropulsion, offer an affordable and reliable platform for suchin-situ data collection. However, reaching the grounding zonerequires vehicles to traverse tens of kilometers under the iceshelf, with approximate position knowledge and no meansof communication, in highly variable and uncertain oceancurrents. To address this challenge, we propose a partiallyobservable MDP approach that exploits model-based knowledgeof the under-ice currents and, critically, of their uncertainty,to synthesize effective guidance policies. The approach usesapproximate dynamic programming to model uncertainty inthe currents, and QMDP to address localization uncertainty.Numerical experiments show that the policy can deliver upto 88.8% of underwater vehicles to the grounding zone – a33% improvement compared to state-of-the-art guidance techniques, and a 262% improvement over uncontrolled drifters.Collectively, these results show that model-based under-iceguidance is a highly promising technique for exploration ofunder-ice cavities, and has the potential to enable cost-effectiveand scalable access to these challenging and rarely observed environments."

The characteristic of active sensors like SAR to be able to observe Earth independent of weather or solar illumination, coupled with regular data acquisition, fosters reliability and encourages the investment in algorithm and product development toward a beneficial result. As SAR systems typically contain proprietary or nationally important technologies, civilian SAR systems are typically developed with a national focus, or in the case of the European Union, with the Union’s focus. As a result, when viewed from a global perspective, SAR programs can be generally viewed as independent developments, each with their own requirements, schedules, development approaches, and data policies. At the same time, these systems can be expensive, and particularly in an era of increasingly open data policies, coordination of programs could reduce redundancy in observations, increase sampling density and measurement diversity, and improve dependability of data streams in the long term. Since 2018, agency representatives from NASA, ESA, DLR, JAXA, ISRO, ASI, and CONAE have been evaluating the possibilities for programmatic and technical coordination of future SAR systems, data sharing, and scientific exploitation. In this paper, we describe the work in discovering trends and possibilities associated with flight systems, by evaluating current and future plans for SAR systems around the world, and identifying opportunities for coordination."

Coronagraphs are generally designed to suppress only a single, on-axis star, but there are numerous binary star systems within our observational range. Multi-star wavefront correction (MSWC) is a technique that uses deformable mirror(s) to simultaneously suppress light from more than one star to create a high contrast dark zone in the image. MSWC has already been well demonstrated in simulation and in air-based testbeds. In this paper, we describe our prepatory vacuum experiments in the Decadal Survey Testbed (DST) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. First we implemented super-Nyquist wavefront control (SNWC, a critical component of MSWC), and then we proceeded to simultaneous sub- and super-Nyquist control. With our existing calibration methods, SNWC reached a contrast of $8.6{\times}10^{-9}$ in a 10\% bandpass around a first-order diffraction spot; calibration improvements are needed to improve model agreement for higher-order spots. We have also implemented changes to our software (the open-source package FALCO) required for MSWC, and identified the necessary changes in hardware. Here we report our best SNWC lab results and our plans for implementing MSWC during a future set of experiments."

The observations show particle heating and acceleration, shock-like wave formation, and whistler wave excitation inside the interface between the dense impulsive plasma structures and the ambient plasma. A multiscale hybrid kinetic simulation provides an explanation of the observed wave-particle interactions with the assumption that the dense plasma structures may be represented by plasma clouds which are formed at the magnetopause layer due to reconnection processes. 

Plain Language Summary: Dense, impulsive plasma structures moving through a background plasma were captured by the NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale mission. The observations show that the dense structures can generate strong perturbations in the electromagnetic field and shock-like waves. Interactions between these electromagnetic waves and the particles results in particle acceleration. 3-D hybrid kinetic modeling (particle description for ions and fluid description for electrons) was used to investigate the plasma physics of the observed structures. It was assumed that the plasma clouds were formed by magnetic field reconnection inside the magnetopause, which is the interface between the solar wind particles and the cold low-density magnetospheric plasma. The work helps us understand the plasma environment at the interface between the Earth and solar wind, near planetary moons, within astrophysical explosions, and possibly at the interface between the solar wind and local interstellar medium."

The detector has a belief state defined by the latent variable stochastic modeling of a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) constructed with bidirectional recurrent layers. In 2000, the Boeing Company and the NASA Langley Research Center jointly developed a quantitative set of metrics for defining loss-of-control (LOC) for a commercial transport. We use the thresholds for these quantitative metrics to define a condition vector for training the CVAE. We demonstrate through experimentation that reconstruction probability is an accurate indicator that the vehicle has shifted to an LOC state. Second, we introduce a technique for inferring that the vehicle is experiencing a flight state change is approaching by measuring a shift in the sampling Gaussian distributions of the latent space. We provide an analysis of its applicability to flight data from a NASA generic commercial transport-type aircraft."

A new generation of climate models has been used to generate LGM simulations as part of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) contribution to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Here, we provide a preliminary analysis and evaluation of the results of these LGM experiments (PMIP4, most of which are PMIP4-CMIP6) and compare them with the previous generation of simulations (PMIP3, most of which are PMIP3-CMIP5). We show that the global averages of the PMIP4 simulations span a larger range in terms of mean annual surface air temperature and mean annual precipitation compared to the PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations, with some PMIP4 simulations reaching a globally colder and drier state. However, the multi-model global cooling average is similar for the PMIP4 and PMIP3 ensembles, while the multi-model PMIP4 mean annual precipitation average is drier than the PMIP3 one. There are important differences in both atmospheric and oceanic circulations between the two sets of experiments, with the northern and southern jet streams being more poleward and the changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation being less pronounced in the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations than in the PMIP3-CMIP5 simulations. Changes in simulated precipitation patterns are influenced by both temperature and circulation changes. Differences in simulated climate between individual models remain large. Therefore, although there are differences in the average behaviour across the two ensembles, the new simulation results are not fundamentally different from the PMIP3-CMIP5 results. Evaluation of large-scale climate features, such as land–sea contrast and polar amplification, confirms that the models capture these well and within the uncertainty of the paleoclimate reconstructions. Nevertheless, regional climate changes are less well simulated: the models underestimate extratropical cooling, particularly in winter, and precipitation changes. These results point to the utility of using paleoclimate simulations to understand the mechanisms of climate change and evaluate model performance."

However, direct measurements of [H2SO4] remain challenging, thus preventing the determination of this important quantity, and, consequently, a complete understanding of its contribution to the NPF process. Several proxies have been developed to bridge the gaps, but their ability to predict [H2SO4] in very specific conditions such as those encountered in volcanic plumes (including in particular high sulphur dioxide mixing ratios) has not been evaluated so far. In this context, the main objective of the present study was to develop new proxies for daytime [H2SO4] in volcanic plume conditions and compare their performance to that of the proxies available in the literature. In specific, the data collected at Maïdo during the OCTAVE 2018 campaign, in the volcanic eruption plume of the Piton de la Fournaise, were first used to derive seven proxies based on the knowledge of sulphur dioxide (SO2) mixing ratio, global radiation, condensation sink (CS) and relative humidity (RH). In three of the seven proxies (F1–F3), all variables were given equal weight in the prediction of [H2SO4], while adjusted powers were allowed for the different variables in the other four proxies (A1–A4). Proxies A1–A4 were overall found to perform better compared to F1–F3, with, in specific, improved predictive ability for [H2SO4] > 2 × 108 per cu.cm. The CS was observed to play an important role in regulating [H2SO4], while, in contrast, the inclusion of RH did not improve the predictions. A last expression accounting for an additional sink term related to cluster formation, S1, was also tested and showed a very good predictive ability over the whole range of measured [H2SO4]. The newly developed proxies were in a second step further evaluated using airborne measurements performed in the passive degassing plume of Etna during the STRAP 2016 campaign. Increased correlations between observed and predicted [H2SO4] were obtained when the dependence of predicted [H2SO4] over CS was the lowest, and when the dependence over [SO2] was concurrently the highest. The best predictions were finally retrieved by the simple formulation of F2 (in which [SO2] and radiation alone were assumed to explain the variations of [H2SO4] with equal contributions), with a pre factor adapted to the STRAP data. All in all, our results illustrate the fairly good capacity of the proxy available in the literature to describe [H2SO4] in volcanic plume conditions, but highlight at the same time the benefit of the newly developed proxies for the prediction of the highest concentrations ([H2SO4] > 2–3 × 108 per cu.cm). Also, the contrasting behaviours of the new proxies in the two investigated datasets indicate that in volcanic plumes like in other environments, the relevance of a proxy can be affected by changes in environmental conditions, and that location specific coefficients do logically improve the predictions."

Its purpose is to create a“multipatch”  scheme  compatible  with  numerical  simulations  of  arbitrary  equations  of  motion  at  any  dis-cretization order in space and time.  In thePatchworkframework, the global simulation is comprised of anarbitrary number of moving, local meshes, or “patches”, which are free to employ their own resolution, co-ordinate system/topology, physics equations, reference frame, and in our new approach, numerical method.Each  local  patch  exchanges  boundary  data  with  a  single  global  patch  on  which  all  other  patches  residethrough  a  client-router-server  parallelization  model.   In  generalizingPatchworkto  be  compatible  witharbitrary order time integration,PatchworkMHDandPatchworkWavehave significantly improved theinterpatch interpolation accuracy by removing an interpolation of interpolated data feedback present in theoriginalPatchworkcode.  Furthermore, we extendPatchworkto bemultimethodby allowing multiplestate vectors to be updated simultaneously, with each state vector providing its own interpatch interpolationand transformation procedures.  As such, our scheme is compatible with nearly any set of hyperbolic partialdifferential equations.  We demonstrate our changes through the implementation of a scalar wave toy-modelthat is evolved on arbitrary, time dependent patch configurations at 4th order accuracy."

Lucy is currently in the final design and fabrication phase (phase C) of mission development. It is scheduled to launch out of Cape Canaveral, Florida, in October 2021. Lucy will be the first space mission to study the Trojan asteroids associated with Jupiter, that are thought to be remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets. Lucy will fly by and carry out remote sensing on six different Trojan asteroids. The mission takes its name from the fossilized human ancestor (called “Lucy” by her discoverers) whose skeleton provided unique insight into humanity's evolution. Likewise, the Lucy mission will revolutionize our knowledge of planetary origins and the formation of the solar system. L’Ralph is one of the instruments on Lucy and it is provided by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). L’Ralph is a combined multi-band visible imager (the Multi-spectral Visible Imaging Camera, MVIC, 0.4-0.85 microns) and wedge-filter infrared spectrometer (Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array, LEISA, 1-3.6 microns). LEISA will allow the team to look for the absorption lines that serve as the fingerprints for different silicates, ices and organics that likely will be on the surface of the Trojan asteroids. MVIC will take color images of the Trojan asteroid targets, and help determine how active they are. This paper will focus on the Integration and Test (I&T) activities for L’Ralph while it is at the NASA GSFC. L’Ralph has two assemblies, the telescope detector assembly (TDA) and main electronics box (MEB). The TDA is a single telescope feeding two focal planes, MVIC and LEISA. L’Ralph integration consists of assembly and alignment of the telescope, electronics box integration, thermal systems integration and the final assembly and testing. This I&T phase will be followed by the L’Ralph calibration and characterization, environmental tests which include electromagnetic interference (EMI)/electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), vibration with sine sweep, acoustics, shock, thermal balance, thermal vacuum, mass properties and center of gravity determination. This paper will briefly discuss L’Ralph shipment and delivery to the spacecraft vendor for observatory level I&T as well as some launch preparation activities."

Here, we introduce a novel method to compare the costs of water conservation measures with the added value that reallocation of water savings might generate if used for expansion of irrigation. Based on detailed water accounting through the use of a high-resolution hydrology-crop model, we modify the traditional cost curve approach with an improved estimation of demand, increasing marginal cost per water conservation measure combination and add a correction to control for impacts on downstream water availability. We apply the method to three major river basins in the Indo-Gangetic plain (Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra), a major global food producing region but increasingly water stressed. Our analysis shows that at basin level only about 10% (Brahmaputra) to just over 20% (Indus and Ganges) of potential water savings would be realised; the equilibrium price for water is too low to make the majority of water conservation measures cost effective. The associated expansion of irrigated area is moderate, about 7% in the Indus basin, 5% in the Ganges and negligible in the Brahmaputra, but farmers' gross profit increases more substantially, by 11%. Increasing the volumetric cost of irrigation water influences supply and demand in a similar way and has little influence on water reallocation. Controlling for the impact on return flows is important and more than halves the amount of water available for reallocation."

However, based on current FAA certification guidelines, manufacturers utilizing current state-of-the-art composites made with adhesive bonds commonly install redundant fasteners to guarantee the strength of these adhesively bonded composite parts. The number of fasteners in a single-aisle commercial transport aircraft is typically on the order of 105, which reduces manufacturing rate, increases cost tremendously, and reduces the advantage of the specific strength composites provide. Due to this, the Adhesive Free Bonding of Composites (AERoBOND) project at NASA Langley Research Center has developed a novel assembly process to manufacture complex composite parts without the use of adhesives and fasteners. However, optimization of the process is currently challenging due to the complex and interdependent process parameters. To assist with the optimization, four machine learning algorithms utilizing gradient boosting decision trees were created to provide predictions for the mechanical and characterization properties of the composite parts. Approximately 200 random states from each algorithm were tested, and the models from each state were isolated and analyzed based on their accuracy, a validation process, and their feature importance. This analysis concluded that the models created from the machine learning algorithms could accelerate a parametric study for the AERoBOND process by rapidly optimizing process parameters to achieve desired performance characteristics."

To introduce the types of failures that an EAP system may experience, a generic EAP system is considered consisting of gas turbine engines, mechanical drives, electric machines, power electronics and distribution systems, energy storage devices, and motor driven propulsors. The functionality provided by each of these EAP subsystems is discussed along with their potential failure modes and possible strategies for mitigating those failures. To further illustrate the role of gas turbine controls in mitigating EAP failure modes, an example based on a simulated EAP concept aircraft proposed by NASA is given.  The  effects  of  failures  are  discussed,  along  with turbomachinery control  strategies, including reversionary control modes, and control limit logic"

Similar free energies in Co-rich and FeNi-based alloy systems result in multiple nanocrystalline phases being formed during devitrification. Studies of multi-phase crystallization processes have been reported for Co-rich alloys but relatively few have investigated FeNi-based systems. A detailed characterization of compositional partitioning and microstructure of an optimally annealed FeNi-based MANC (Fe70Ni30)80Nb4Si2B14 alloy is presented through complementary high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and atom probe tomography (APT). HRTEM demonstrates orientation
relationships between FCC and BCC nanocrystals, suggesting heterogeneous nucleation of nanocrystals in the amorphous matrix or a cooperative mechanism of nucleation between BCC and FCC nanocrystallites. APT results show evidence for (i) the segregation of Fe and Ni between nanocrystals of different phases, (ii) B partitioning to the amorphous phase, and (iii) an Nb-enriched shell surrounding nanocrystals."

The majority of proposed mission architectures envision “living off the land” by leveraging Martian water-ice deposits for fuel production and other purposes. Fortunately for mission designers, water ice exists on Mars in plentiful volumes. The challenge is isolating accessible ice deposits within regions that optimize other preferred  landing-site  conditions.  Here,  we  present  the first results  of  the  Mars  Subsurface Water  Ice Mapping (SWIM) project, which has the aim of searching for buried ice resources across the mid-latitudes. Through  the  integration  of  orbital  datasets  in  concert  with  new  data-processing  techniques,  the  SWIM project assesses the likelihood of ice by quantifying the consistency of multiple, independent data sources with the presence of ice. Concentrating our efforts across a significant portion of the northern Hemisphere, our composite ice consistency maps indicate that the broad plains of Arcadia and the extensive glacial networks across Deuteronilus Mensae match the greatest number of remote sensing criteria for accessible ice-rich, subsurface material situated equatorward of the contemporary ice-stability zone."

To determine the impact of dust aerosol on HIS radiance assimilation, we use a modified radiance assimilation system employing a one-dimensional variational assimilation system (1DVAR) developed under the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Numerical Weather Prediction–Satellite Application Facility (NWP-SAF) project, which uses the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV). Dust aerosol impacts on analyzed temperature and moisture fields are quantified using synthetic HIS observations from rawinsonde, Micropulse Lidar Network (MPLNET), and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). Specifically, a unit dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) contamination at 550 nm can introduce larger than 2.4 and 8.6 K peak biases in analyzed temperature and dewpoint, respectively, over our test domain. We hypothesize that aerosol observations, or even possibly forecasts from aerosol predication models, may be used operationally to mitigate dust induced temperature and moisture analysis biases through forward radiative transfer modeling."

Optical fiber sensors that utilize fiber Bragg gratings are a viable option for temperature sensing in volatile liquid such as liquid oxygen because there is no risk of electrical sparking and no electromagnetic interference. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Armstrong Flight Research Center (Edwards, California) has developed a novel, simple-to-fabricate fiber array sensor that has been tested and found to be three times more sensitive than typical fiber sensors under cryogenic condition (traditional fiber sensors can suffer from reduced sensitivity below 100 K). Cryogenic temperature monitoring using the NASA fiber optic sensing system is demonstrated in a simulated cryostatic condition, as well as in an elevated pressure environment under liquid nitrogen. Measurement accuracy is compared with traditional silicon diodes. Instrument installation, sensor characteristics, and experimental results are discussed in detail."

Special Committee 228 (SC-228) have focused on relatively large UAS transitioning to and from Class A airspace.  In an effort to expand the range of vehicle classes that can access the NAS, the NASA UAS Integration in the NAS project has investigated Low Size, Weight, and Power (Low SWaP) technologies that would allow smaller UAS to detect-and-avoid (DAA) traffic. Through batch and human in the loop (HITL) simulation studies, the UAS Integration in the NAS DAA subproject have identified candidate performance standards that would contribute to enabling extended Low SWaP, UAS operations under 10,000 feet. These candidate performance standards include minimum field of regard (FOR) values for Low SWaP air surveillance sensors as well as a DAA well-clear (DWC) definition which can be applied to non-cooperative traffic to reduce the required maneuver initiation range.   To test the assumptions of the project’s simulation studies and validate the candidate performance standards, a live flight research event was executed at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center.  The UAS Integration in the NAS Project Flight Test 6 Full Mission sought to characterize UAS pilot responses to traffic conflicts using a representative Low SWAP DAA system in an operational NAS environment.  To achieve this, live, virtual and constructive distributed environment (LVC-DE) elements were combined to simulate a sector of Oakland center airspace and induce encounters with a live, manned aircraft.  A Navmar Applied Sciences Tigershark XP was used as the UAS ownship and was integrated into the test architecture to enable it to be controlled from a Vigilant Spirit Control Station (VSCS) research ground control station.  Qualified UAS pilots were recruited to act as subject pilots under test (SPUT) to control the Tigershark XP in a simulated mission while coordinating with a participating air traffic controller in simulated airspace.  The intruder speed, intruder equipage and encounter geometry were varied between six scripted encounters per SPUT.  Various metrics were collected including pilot reaction time from the onset of DAA alert, ATC coordination rate, probability and severity of losses of DAA well clear, and subjective ratings of system acceptability. The implications of these results on the development of standards for Low SWAP DAA systems will be discussed."

Concentration and emission changes of reactive species can cause multiple changes in the composition of radiatively active species: tropospheric ozone, stratospheric ozone, stratospheric water vapour, secondary inorganic and organic aerosol, and methane. Where possible we break down the ERFs from each emitted species into the contributions from the composition changes. The ERFs are calculated for each of the models that participated in the AerChemMIP experiments as part of the CMIP6 project, where the relevant model output was available.

The 1850 to 2014 multi-model mean ERFs (± standard deviations) are −1.03 ± 0.37 W/sq.m for SO2 emissions, −0.25 ± 0.09 W/sq.m for organic carbon (OC), 0.15 ± 0.17 W/sq.m for black carbon (BC) and −0.07 ± 0.01 W/sq.m for NH3. For the combined aerosols (in the piClim-aer experiment) it is −1.01 ± 0.25 W/sq.m. The multi-model means for the reactive well-mixed greenhouse gases (including any effects on ozone and aerosol chemistry) are 0.67 ± 0.17 W/sq.m for methane (CH4), 0.26 ± 0.07 W/sq.m for nitrous oxide (N2O) and 0.12 ± 0.2 W/sq.m for ozone-depleting halocarbons (HC). Emissions of the ozone precursors nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds and both together (O3) lead to ERFs of 0.14 ± 0.13, 0.09 ± 0.14 and 0.20 ± 0.07 W/sq.m respectively. The differences in ERFs calculated for the different models reflect differences in the complexity of their aerosol and chemistry schemes, especially in the case of methane where tropospheric chemistry captures increased forcing from ozone production."

Enhanced summertime westerly winds have been linked to cold summertime sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Previous studies have suggested that Ekman transport or upwelling is responsible for this seasonal cooling. Here, another process is presented in which enhanced vertical mixing, driven by summertime wind anomalies, moves heat downward, cooling the sea surface and simultaneously warming the subsurface waters. The anomalously cold SSTs draw heat from the atmosphere into the ocean, leading to increased depth-integrated ocean heat content. The subsurface heat is returned to the surface mixed layer during the autumn and winter as the mixed layer deepens, leading to anomalously warm SSTs and potentially reducing sea ice cover. Observational analyses and numerical experiments support our proposed mechanism, showing that enhanced vertical mixing produces subsurface warming and cools the surface mixed layer. Nevertheless, the dominant driver of surface cooling remains uncertain; the relative importance of advective and mixing contributions to the surface cooling is model dependent. Modeling results suggest that sea ice volume is more sensitive to summertime winds than sea ice extent, implying that enhanced summertime westerly winds may lead to thinner sea ice in the following winter, if not lesser ice extent. Thus, strong summertime winds could precondition the sea ice cover for a rapid retreat in the following melt season."

We present our analysis of a high Alfv ́en Mach number (MA= 27) shock, by utilizing multipoint measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft during a crossing of Earth’s quasi-perpendicular bow  shock. We find that the shock dynamics are mostly driven by reflected ions, perturbations that they generate, and nonlinear amplification of the perturbations. Our analyses indicate that reflected ions create modest magnetic enhancements upstream of the shock front which evolve in a nonlinear manner as they traverse the shock foot. They can transform into proto-shocks that propagate at small angles to the magnetic field and towards the bow shock. The nonstationary bow shock shows signatures of both reformation and surface  ripples. Our observations  indicate  that  although shock reformation occurs, the main shock layer never disappears.  These observations are at high plasmaβ, a parameter regime which has not been well explored by numerical models."

The flow conditions match selected test conditions from a recent wind tunnel experiment in the National Transonic Facility at the NASA Langley Research Center. Previous work involving parallel stability computations of a boundary layer flow based on the conical flow approximation has shown that the measured onset of laminar-turbulent transition during the experiments can be correlated with the linear amplification of Tollmien- Schlichting (TS) and stationary crossflow (CF) instabilities in the swept wing boundary layer. Here, we examine the effects of the simplifying approximations in both basic state computation and the stability analysis, with the goal of quantifying the resulting changes in the N-factor correlations. Specifically, the basic states are computed by using full Navier-Stokes equations and the stability analysis is performed by using a nonorthogonal coordinate system that allows a clear distinction between planar TS and CF instabilities. Furthermore, the effects of curvature and nonparallel mean flow have been included in the stability computations based on the parabolized stability equations (PSE). The fully turbulent Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) mean flow solutions show good agreement with the measured wall pressure distribution. Viscous-inviscid interactive effects are observed to be important because the shock fronts along the suction surface are influenced by the imposed transition front. The stability results confirm the previous findings related to TS amplification within the inboard region of the wing and the dominance of stationary CF modes in the outboard region. However, given the close proximity of the measured transition front and the dual shock system within the outer part of the wing, the onset of transition may well be shock limited within the outboard region. In general, the transition criterion based on the dual N-factor method with <i>N<sub>TS</sub> = N<sub>CF</sub></i> = 6 is reasonably successful at correlating with the measured transition fronts at <i>Re<sub>MAC</sub></i> = 15 million and <i>AoA</i> = 1.5, 2 degrees; however, the low values of the correlating N-factors at <i>Re<sub>MAC</sub></i> = 17.5 million support the hypothesis that the measured transition at the higher Reynolds number may have been strongly influenced by the merging of turbulent wedges that originate from surface imperfections near the leading edge."

However, other rotational states are possible, including spin–orbit resonant configurations, particularly when higher eccentricity orbits can be maintained in a system. Additionally, the oscillating strain as a planet moves from periastron to apoastron results in friction and tidal heating, which can be an important energy source. Here, we simulate the climate of ocean-covered planets near the inner edge of the habitable zone around M to solar stars with the NASA GISS ROCKE-3D general circulation model, and leverage the planetary evolution software package, VPLanet, to calculate tidal heating rates for Earth-sized planets orbiting 2600 and 3000 K stars. This study is the first to use a 3D general circulation model that implements tidal heating to investigate habitability for multiple resonant states. We find that for reference experiments without tidal heating, the resonant state has little impact on the radial position of the inner edge because for a given stellar flux, higher-order states tend to be warmer than synchronous rotators, but for a given temperature, have drier upper atmospheres. However, when strong tidal heating is present, the rotational component implies a strong dependence of habitable conditions on the system evolution and rotational state. Since tidal and stellar heating both decrease rapidly with orbital distance, this results in a compact orbital width separating temperate and uninhabitable climates. We summarize these results and also compare ROCKE-3D to previously published simulations of the inner edge."

The primary element shape was a pair of elliptical planform ramps that were inclined at equal and opposite angles with respect to the local streamwise direction. The element shapes were designed to induce transient growth disturbances that would lead to sustained azimuthal modulation of the boundary layer flow while limiting the nearfield disturbances to avoid an immediate, i.e., effective tripping of the boundary layer. The bulk of the run matrix consisted of testing different element height sat free stream unit Reynolds numbers ranging from 9.8 to 13.1 million per meter. Other element shapes previously designed for tripping hypersonic boundary layers were also implemented. The model was instrumented with surface mounted Kulite<sup>®</sup> and PCB<sup>®</sup> pressure transducers and thermocouples. Spectra from the PCBs<sup>®</sup> indicated clear suppression of the second-mode instability; however, neither the PCB<sup>®</sup> spectra nor the heat transfer data presented strong evidence for delayed turbulent flow. Complementary stability computations likewise demonstrated second-mode reduction, particularly just downstream of the roughness, but also revealed a rise in first mode (streak-instability) amplitudes from the baseline that was likely responsible for the earlier transition observed for taller roughness cases."

This paper represents a continuation of our numerical investigation of the flow instabilities over the main test surface of the BOLT configuration by using state-of-the-art tools in multidimensional instability analysis. Specifically, the paper extends our previous computations by considering the separate effects of a nonzero angle of attack and a nonzero yaw on the modal instability characteristics of the boundary layer streaks adjacent to the minor-axis symmetry plane, specifically near both ends of the azimuthal region of a thick boundary layer in the middle, where this region rapidly changes to a thinner boundary layer on either side. At the t = 28.8767 s condition from the ascent part of the anticipated flight trajectory with a flight Mach number of M<sub>∞</sub> = 5.53 and unit Reynolds number of 4.25 x 10<sup>6</sup>/m, either type of departure from the design condition is shown to have a considerable impact on the structure of the basic state rollup within the region of interest and, hence, also on the amplification characteristics of instability waves within the resulting streaks. Yet, for a yaw angle of β = 4 degrees, the computations indicate only a slight reduction with respect to the peak N-factor of nearly 11 at the design condition of zero degrees yaw and zero degrees angle of attack. In contrast, an angle of attack equal to α = 4 degrees, the peak N-factor decreases to nearly 6 on the leeward side and increases above 16 on the windward side, making the onset of transition highly likely on the windward side. Computations also highlight the role of streak instabilities that originate as Mack mode disturbances and also demonstrate the potential pitfalls in using surface pressure sensors alone to gauge the magnitude of instability amplification."

Under rising temperatures, growing populations, and an apparent weakening of the South Asian monsoon in recent decades, concerns regarding drought and its potential impacts on water and food security are on the rise. Reliable sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) hydrological forecasts could, in principle, help governments and international organizations to better assess risk and act in the face of an oncoming drought. Here, we leverage recent improvements in S2S meteorological forecasts and the growing power of Earth Observations to provide more accurate monitoring of hydrological states for forecast initialization. Information from both sources is merged in a South and Southeast Asia sub-seasonal to seasonal hydrological forecasting system (SAHFS-S2S), developed collaboratively with the NASA SERVIR program and end-users across the region. This system applies the Noah-MultiParameterization (NoahMP) Land Surface Model (LSM) in the NASA Land Information System (LIS), driven by downscaled meteorological fields from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) and Climate Hazards InfraRed Precipitation products (CHIRP and CHIRPS) to optimize initial conditions. The NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model - sub-seasonal to seasonal (GEOS-S2S) forecasts, downscaled using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) General Analog Regression Downscaling (GARD) tool and quantile mapping, are then applied to drive 5-km resolution hydrological forecasts to a 9-month forecast time horizon. Results show that the skillful predictions of root zone soil moisture can be made one to two months in advance for forecasts initialized in rainy seasons and up to 8 months when initialized in dry seasons. The memory of accurate initial conditions can positively contribute to forecast skills throughout the entire 9-month prediction period in areas with limited precipitation. This SAHFS-S2S has been operationalized at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) to support drought monitoring and warning needs in the region."

Vulnerability to heat-related illnesses is further compounded by risk factors such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health conditions. The City of Sacramento, as California’s fastest-growing city by population, is particularly invested in combatting the UHI effect. The team collaborated with the City of Sacramento and urban planning firm, Dyett and Bhatia, on three main goals: assessing urban heat at the neighborhood scale, identifying priority areas for cooling interventions, and assessing heat risk to the population. This project utilized NASA Earth observation products to identify hotspots within the communities of Sacramento and create maps of urban heat, the heat-mitigation index, and heat risk from 2016-2020. The team used the Surface Reflectance product from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) thermal infrared sensor. Additionally, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) urban cooling model was used to assess the impact of increased tree canopy scenarios. Urban hotspots were identified in central Sacramento and along major transportation corridors such as Stockton Boulevard, while the highest risk areas were identified in the communities of Fruitridge/Broadway and North Sacramento. This project identified these high-opportunity areas for heat mitigation to inform the City of Sacramento's General Plan and reduce citizen risk by addressing urban heat islands."

This coordinated campaign utilizing the twopremier near-infrared facilities in the northern hemisphere enabled us to sample distinct projections ofthe coma into the plane of the sky simultaneously, and provided an unprecedented view into the innercoma of 46P/Wirtanen near closest approach.  We report rotational temperatures, production rates,and abundance ratios (i.e., mixing ratios) for all sampled species and compare ouriSHELLresultsto simultaneous (or near-simultaneous) measurements taken with NIRSPEC-2.

This report documents a screening test, which is a precursor to more controlled modelling experiments.  The purpose of this experiment was to identify variables and prototype design features that might play a dominant role in the acoustic performance of these structures.  To date, twenty-four prototypes, each with an overall shape of a cube (nominally 50 mm x 50 mm x 50 mm), were designed and additively manufactured from thermoplastics using a Fused Filament Fabrication technique.  The prototypes were tested in the NASA Glenn and Langley Normal Incidence Tubes to experimentally determine the acoustic absorption as a function of frequency from 400 Hz to 3000 Hz.  Results indicate that a variety of structures exhibit substantial acoustic absorption in that frequency range, with an average absorption coefficient greater than 0.6, especially in the frequency range of 400 Hz to 1000 Hz. Six basic prototype designs were chosen to inform future modeling research. Results of these experiments can be used to evaluate existing physics-based models of the interaction of sound waves with these structures or to develop new models.  Validated physics-based models of these structures can help engineers optimize the designs for different commercial noise control applications."

Since then, only a few systems have operated in microgravity with scarce documentation of these flights. The lack of measured data and detailed documentation makes identifying the necessary next steps difficult for researchers entering the field of refrigeration in space. This paper provides a review of available literature for vapor compression systems flown in microgravity by outlining the history of vapor compression devices in space and presenting performance data. Moreover, gaps in the literature are highlighted and open questions are posed based on the reviewed material. Next steps of research are suggested to support and ultimately achieve reliable vapor compression refrigeration in space. Calculating equivalent masses for a fair comparison of different microgravity cooling technologies is proposed by capturing both energy consumption and used volume."

At large spatial scales, remote sensing-based (RS) models are often used to quantify ET. Despite the large number of RS ET models available, few include soil moisture as a key environmental input, which can degrade model accuracy and utility. Here, we use model assimilation enhanced soil moisture estimates from the NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission as a water supply control in the MOD16 ET algorithm framework. SMAP-derived daily surface (0-5cm depth) and root zone (0-1m depth) soil moisture are used with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation observations, and 4km gridded regional surface meteorology (Gridmet) as primary inputs for estimating daily ET and underlying model soil and stomatal conductance terms. We calibrated the model environmental response parameters using tower eddy covariance ET observations representing major North American biomes. The model ET results were validated using a holdout set of tower observations spanning a large regional climate gradient. The updated ET estimates outperform the baseline MOD16 product across all tower validation sites (RMSE = 0.758 vs 1.108 mm day-1; R2 = 0.68 vs0.45, respectively). Smaller relative improvements were obtained using a recalibrated model with 4km Gridmet meteorology, but no soil moisture control (RMSE = 0.813 mm day-1; R2 = 0.66), indicating that these changes are essential for the improved model performance. The soil moisture-constrained model improvements and relative benefits from the SMAP observations are greater in arid climates, consistent with stronger soil moisture control on ET in water-limited regions. The use of SMAP soil moisture as an additional model constraint improves MOD16 regional performance and provides a new framework for investigating both soil and atmosphere controls on ET."

Here, we investigate the seasonal cycle of the air-sea exchange of CO2 and pCO2,sw (surface seawater pCO2) and their long term changes using the CMIP6 submission of the NASA-GISS modelE (GISS-E2.1-G). In comparison to the CMIP5 submission (GISS-E2-R), we find that on the global scale, the seasonal cycles of the CO2 flux and NPP have improved, while the seasonal cycles of DIC, alkalinity, and macronutrients have deteriorated. Moreover, for all ocean biogeochemietry fields, changes in skill between E2.1-G and E2-R display large regional variability. For E2.1-G, we find similar modeled and observed CO2 flux seasonal cycles in the subtropical gyres, where seasonal anomalies of pCO2,sw and the flux are temperature-driven, and the Southern Ocean, where anomalies are DIC-driven. Biases in these seasonal cycles are largest in the subpolar and equatorial regions, driven by a combination of biases in temperature, DIC, alkalinity, and wind speed. When comparing the historical simulation to a simulation with an idealized increase in atmospheric pCO2, we find that the seasonal amplitudes of the CO2 flux and pCO2,sw generally increase. These changes are produced by increases in the sensitivity of pCO2,sw to its respective drivers. These findings are consistent with the notion that the sensitivity of pCO2,sw is expected to increase due to the increase of atmospheric pCO2, with changes in the seasonality of temperature, DIC, and alkalinity having secondary influences."

In this paper, we report on a numerica lsimulation of a new type of coupled eruption, in which a coronal jet initiated by a large pseudostreamer filament eruption triggers a streamer-blowout coronal mass ejection (CME) from the neighboring helmet  streamer.   Our  configuration  has  a  large  opposite-polarity  region  positioned  between  the  polarcoronal  hole  and  a  small  equatorial  coronal  hole,  forming  a  pseudostreamer  flanked  by  the  coronalholes and the helmet streamer.  Further out, the pseudostreamer stalk takes the shape of an extendedarc  in  the  heliosphere.   We  energize  the  system  by  applying  photospheric  shear  along  a  section  of the polarity inversion line within the pseudostreamer.  The resulting sheared-arcade filament channel develops a flux rope that eventually erupts as a classic coronal-hole-type jet.  However, the enhanced breakout reconnection above the channel as the jet is launched progresses into the neighboring helmet streamer, partially launching the jet along closed helmet streamer field lines and blowing out thestreamer top to produce a classic bubble-like CME. This CME is strongly deflected from the jet’s initial trajectory and contains a mixture of open and closed magnetic field lines.  We present the detailed dynamics of this new type of coupled eruption, its underlying mechanisms and the implications of thiswork for the interpretation of in-situ and remote-sensing observations."

Most studies finding evidence of EDW indicate that both recent decadal and future projected warming rates are greater at higher elevations. In this study, we examine the roles of Arctic amplification and elevation on future warming rates in winter and summer in eastern Siberia (50-70°N; 80-180°E). This region includes four major river basins that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the Yenisei, Lena, Indigirka, and Kolyma) and intersects with mountain ranges in northern Mongolia and eastern Siberia. We analyse projected 21st century temperature projections using a six-member ensemble of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) with a radiative forcing of 8.5 W m-2. Projected warming rates in winter for the 21st century are dominated by Arctic amplification, which leads to significantly larger warming rates at higher latitudes, with latitudinal gradients of about 0.16°C per degree latitude. In summer, the latitudinal gradient is near zero (0.02°C per degree of latitude). Within specific latitude bands, we also find EDW. However, unlike most mid-latitude locations where warming rates are greater at higher elevations, we find that future warming rates are smaller at higher elevations for this high-latitude region, particularly during winter, with statistically significant rates varying between -0.70 and -2.46 °C/km for different 5° latitude bands. The decrease in warming rates with elevation in winter at the highest latitudes is primarily attributed to strong inversions and changes in the lapse rate as free-air temperatures warm at slower rates than surface temperatures. In summer, the elevation dependence is much weaker than in winter but still statistically significant and negative in all but the most northern latitude band with values ranging between -0.10 and -0.56 °C/km."

High quality tantalum capacitors are likely the only type of components where soldering simulation is the first step during screening. Nevertheless, post-soldering failures of tantalum capacitors happen and require additional analysis. Popcorning is a well-known effect in plastic encapsulated microcircuits (PEM) and it occurs also in chip tantalum capacitors. The sensitivity of parts to the presence of moisture during soldering is characterized by the moisture sensitivity level (MSL); however, contrary to PEMs, there is no standard procedure for establishing MSL for tantalum capacitors. The effect of absorbed moisture on soldering related degradation and failures in tantalum capacitors have not been studied properly yet, and there is no sufficient information regarding the difference in the sensitivity to soldering between polymer and MnO2 tantalum capacitors. In this work, 16 types of polymer and 9 types of MnO2 cathodes tantalum capacitors with different moisture content have been tested before and after reflow soldering. The level of moisture release after soldering has been estimated and thermo-mechanical analysis used to assess deformation of capacitors during soldering simulations. Results show that moisture uptake in similar parts is approximately two times greater in polymer than in MnO2 capacitors. Cracking of the case and degradation of parameters can occur in both types of parts, but MnO2 capacitors are much more likely to fail catastrophically with a short circuit and possible ignition during the first power-on cycle. This type of failure in MnO2 capacitors is lot-related, can occur even at derated voltages and relatively low levels of moisture sorption corresponding to room conditions. Baking before soldering is an effective measure to prevent failures even in lots susceptible to popcorning damage. Recommendations for baking and testing to establish MSL are suggested."

However, traditional-core sandwich composites can exhibit certain manufacturing and in-service problems that have the potential to be alleviated through the use of other sandwich composite concepts. Fluted-core sandwich composite structures, which consist of integral angled web members with structural radius fillers, or noodles, spaced between laminate face sheets, is one such alternative and is considered herein. Because the noodles can consist of unidirectional fiber and can represent a significant amount of the total fluted-core cross section, accurate prediction of the structural response requires that the noodles be modeled with sufficient detail. Previous work showed that the structural response of fluted-core sandwich composite structures could be accurately represented with detailed finite element analysis using a combination of solid and shell elements. In these models, solid elements were used to represent the noodles and shell elements were used to represent the webs and faces. However, this previous solid-noodle modeling approach was also quite computationally intensive, and therefore not practical for large or complicated structures. In this document, a less computationally intensive shell-noodle approach, wherein the entire fluted-core sandwich composite construction is modeled with shell elements, is discussed and predicted structural responses are compared with those of the solid-noodle approach. It is found that by proper selection of certain geometric parameters (thickness and offset of the shell elements that represent the noodle), the shell-noodle modeling approach can be made “structurally equivalent” to the solid-noodle modelling approach."

In addition, a “single source of truth” about the system, that is up-to-date in all respects of the design, becomes the authoritative source of data and information about the system. This promotes consistency and efficiency in regard to integration of the system elements as the design emerges and thereby may further optimize the designs.

The latest generation of Earth system models includes aerosol and chemistry components that interact with each other and with the biosphere. These interactions introduce a complex web of feedbacks that is important to understand and quantify.

This paper addresses multiple pathways for aerosol and chemical feedbacks in Earth system models. These focus on changes in natural emissions (dust, sea salt, dimethyl sulfide, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and lightning) and changes in reaction rates for methane and ozone chemistry. The feedback terms are then given by the sensitivity of a pathway to climate change multiplied by the radiative effect of the change.

We find that the overall climate feedback through chemistry and aerosols is negative in the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) Earth system models due to increased negative forcing from aerosols in a climate with warmer surface temperatures following a quadrupling of CO2 concentrations. This is principally due to increased emissions of sea salt and BVOCs which are sensitive to climate change and cause strong negative radiative forcings. Increased chemical loss of ozone and methane also contributes to a negative feedback. However, overall methane lifetime is expected to increase in a warmer climate due to increased BVOCs. Increased emissions of methane from wetlands would also offset some of the negative feedbacks. The CMIP6 experimental design did not allow the methane lifetime or methane emission changes to affect climate, so we found a robust negative contribution from interactive aerosols and chemistry to climate sensitivity in CMIP6 Earth system models."

In order to validate these measurements, the CTEs of Y2Si2O7, Yb2Si2O7 and SiO2 were also determined from the same scans. The directional CTEs for γ-Y2Si2O7 were determined to be αa=5.84×10-6/K, αb=6.81×10-6/K and αc=0.81×10-6/K, and β-Yb2Si2O7 was determined to have values of αa=6.89×10-6/K, αb=4.81×10-6/K and αc=2.78×10-6/K. The average CTEs of γ-Y2Si2O7 and β-Yb2Si2O7 were determined to be 4.5×10-6/K and 4.7×10-6/K, respectively, which agreed with previous analyses. Ca2Y8(SiO4)6O2 exhibited directional CTEs of αa=9.36×10-6/K and αc=7.95×10-6/K (averaged between two sets of data), whereas Ca2Yb8(SiO4)6O2 had values that were very similar (αa=9.63×10-6/K, αc=7.45×10-6/K).

Using a dynamical ocean biogeochemical forecast forced by seasonal forecasts   of   atmospheric   and   physical   ocean   variables,   we   produce   seasonal predictions of chlorophyll concentration at the global scale. Results show significant Anomaly Correlation Coefficients (ACCs) for the majority of regions (11 out of the 12 regions for the 1-month lead forecast). Root mean square errors are smaller (<0.05μg chlorophyll (chl) L−1) in the Equatorial regions compared to the higher latitudes(range from  0.05 up  to 0.13 μg chl  L−1).  The forecast  for all  regions except three (North  Atlantic,   South  Pacific  and   North   Indian)  are  within  the   Semi-Interquartile Range   of   the   satellite   chlorophyll   concentration (Suomi-National   Polar-orbiting Partnership   (NPP),   27.9%).

These species could not be studied near closest approach in mid-December because there was insufficient Doppler shift to separate the cometary emission from their corresponding telluric absorption lines. We employed the [OI] observations as a proxy for the CO2/H2O ratio, as CO2 cannot be observed directly from the ground, and space-based assets sensitive to CO2 were not able to observe 46P during this apparition. We focused our analysis on H2O, CO, CH4, C2H6, CH3OH, and CO2 (via [OI] emission). We detected strong emissions from H2O, C2H6, and CH3OH. Over the 3 nights, we found evidence for changing mixing ratios, mostly due to a variable H2O production rate. In 46P, C2H6 and CH3OH are enriched compared to cometary averages, with mixing ratios relative to H2O of ∼1% and ∼3%, respectively. Measurements of CH4 and CO have been especially rare in JFCs. We report significant 3σ upper limits on CH4/H2O<0.97% and CO/H2O<0.54%. They place CH4 being near-average or depleted, and CO being strongly depleted in 46P compared with Oort cloud comets. 46P has comparable CO/H2O to the few other measurements in JFCs, but enriched in C2H6 and CH3OH. Our inferred CO2/H2O mixing ratio is∼15%, though accounting for systematic uncertainties from the lack of knowledge of [OI] photochemistry means a value between 10% and 20% is likely. The compositional profile of46P is similar to another small, hyperactive comet: 103P/Hartley 2. The mechanism of CO2-driven water-rich ice grain production proposed for 103P/Hartley 2 may be operating on 46P as well."

The CS was highly tilted, with its normal  pointing strongly duskward. Its extreme thinness was confirmed by a curvature analysis of the magnetic field lines. The event was associated with a guide field of 8% of the reconnecting components. From the pitch angle distributions of low-energy electrons we  infer that the crossing occurred earthward of the X-line. Traveling practically normal to the CS, MMS encountered an ion diffusion region (IDR) in which was embedded an electron diffusion region (EDR). IDR signatures included breaking of the ion frozen-in condition in the presence of Hall B and E fields. EDR signatures included a strong out of-plane current associated with a super-Alfvenic electron jet, evidence of positive energy transfer, and a temperature anisotropy (TeII > Te1) which disappeared at the field reversal. Derived scale sizes normal to the CS are: ~6.9 de (EDR) and ~0.4 di (IDR) (40 and 100 km). We estimate the average dimensionless reconnection rate as 0.077 + 0.050. The observations and inferences are supported by PIC numerical simulations. We find very good agreement in the reconnection rates. We also discuss the effects of asymmetries in the density, temperature and magnetic field strength on the Hall fields and length of the outflow jets. The event is associated with a substorm onset which began 7 min after the MMS observations."

A review,"Smallholder farmers struggle to achieve food security in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is urgently required to find appropriate practices for enhancing crop production while avoiding large increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in SSA. This review aims to identify common smallholder farming practices for enhancing crop production, to assess how these affect GHG emissions and to identify strategies that not only enhance crop production but also mitigate GHG emissions in SSA. To increase crop production and ensure food security, smallholder farmers usually expand agricultural land, develop water harvesting and irrigation techniques and increase cropping intensity and fertilizer use. These practices may result in changing carbon stocks and GHG emissions, potentially creating trade-offs between food security and GHG mitigation. Agricultural land expansion at the expense of forests is the most dominant source of GHG emissions in SSA. While water harvesting and irrigation can increase soil organic carbon, they can trigger GHG emissions. Increasing cropping intensity can enhance the decomposition of soil organic matter, thus releasing carbon dioxide. Increasing nitrogen fertilizer use can enhance soil organic carbon, but also leads to increasing nitrous oxide emissions. An integrated land, water and nutrient management strategy is necessary to enhance crop production and mitigate GHG emissions. Among the most relevant strategies found, agroforestry practices in degraded and marginal lands could replace expanding agricultural croplands. In addition, water management, via adequate rainwater harvesting and irrigation techniques, together with appropriate nutrient management should be considered. Therefore, a land-water-nutrient nexus (LWNN) approach will enable an integrated and sustainable solution to increasing crop production and mitigating GHG emissions. Various technical, economic and policy barriers hinder implementing the LWNN approach on the ground, but these may be overcome through developing appropriate technologies, disseminating them through farmer to farmer approaches and developing specific policies to address smallholder land tenure issues and motivate long-term investment."

WLDAS was configured through discussions with partners, with the goal of groundwater sustainability planning for the state of California in mind. The publicly available output dataset has a 1-km grid resolution and spans 1979–present, which makes it suitable for water resources assessments. The data are also able to contextualize the recent drought events in California. Assimilation of Leaf Area Index, which is demonstrated herein to improve simulation over agricultural areas in California, specifically in terms of evapotranspiration in irrigation regions, will be included along with other data assimilation in subsequent releases of WLDAS."

The analyzed data sample includes 32 SEP events occurring between 2010 and 2014, with a statistically significant proton signal at energies in excess of a few tens of MeV, unambiguously
recorded at three spacecraft locations. The spatial distributions of SEP intensities are reconstructed by assuming an energy-dependent 2D Gaussian functional form, and accounting for the correlation between the intensity and the speed of the parent coronal mass ejection (CME), and the magnetic-field-line connection angle. The CME measurements used are from the Space Weather Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (DONKI). The model performance, including its extrapolations to lower/higher energies, is tested by comparing with the spectra of 20 SEP events not used to derive the model parameters. Despite the simplicity of the model, the observed and predicted event-integrated and peak intensities at Earth and at the STEREO spacecraft for these events show remarkable agreement, both in the spectral shapes and their absolute values."

We present the initial results from a coordinated Intercomparison, CovidMIP, of Earth system model simulations which assess the impact on climate of these emissions reductions. Twelve models performed multiple initial-condition ensembles to produce over 300 simulations spanning both initial condition and model structural uncertainty. We find model consensus on reduced aerosol amounts (particularly over southern and eastern Asia) and associated increases in surface shortwave radiation levels. However, any impact on near-surface temperature or rainfall during 2020-2024 is extremely small and is not detectable in this initial analysis. Regional analyses on a finer scale, and closer attention to extremes (especially linked to changes in atmospheric composition and air quality) are required to test the impact of COVID- 19-related emission reductions on near-term climate."

used in a variety of cell‐free experiments such as the expression of native and de
novo proteins as well as various display methods to select for functional polypeptides.
We developed a refined PURE‐based display method for the preparation of
stable messenger RNA (mRNA) and complementary DNA (cDNA)‐peptide conjugates and validated its utility for in vitro selection. Our conjugate formation efficiency exceeded 40%, followed by gel purification to allow minimum carry‐over of components from the translation system to the downstream assay enabling clean and efficient random peptide sequence screening. We chose the commercially available anti‐FLAG M2 antibody as a target molecule for validation. Starting from approximately 1.7 × 10(exp 12) random sequences, a round‐by‐round high‐throughput sequencing showed clear enrichment of the FLAG epitope DYKDDD as well as revealing consensus FLAG epitope motif DYK(D/L/N)(L/Y/D/N/F)D. Enrichment of core FLAG motifs lacking one of the four key residues (DYKxxD) indicates that Tyr(Y) and Lys (K) appear as the two key residues essential for binding. Furthermore, the comparison between mRNA display and cDNA display method resulted in overall similar performance with slightly higher enrichment for mRNA display. We also show that gel purification steps in the refined PURE‐based display method improve conjugate formation efficiency and enhance the enrichment rate of FLAG epitope motifs in later rounds of selection especially for mRNA display. Overall, the generalized procedure and consistent performance of two different display methods achieved by the commercially available PURE system will be useful for future studies to explore the sequence and functional space of diverse polypeptides."

Existence of gas close to the central engine implies large radiation intensities and correspondingly large gas densities if the gas is to remain partially ionized. Simple estimates indicate that high gas densities are needed to allow survival of iron against ionization. These are high enough that rates for many atomic processes are affected by mechanisms related to interactions with nearby ions and electrons. Radiation intensities are high enough that stimulated processes can be important. Most models currently in use for interpreting relativistic lines use atomic rate coefficients designed for use at low densities and neglect stimulated processes. In our work so far we have presented atomic structure calculations with the goal of providing physically appropriate models at densities consistent with line-emitting gas near compact objects. In this paper we apply these rates to photoionization calculations, and produce ionization balance curves and X-ray emissivities and opacities which are appropriate for high densities and high radiation intensities. The final step in our program will be presented in a subsequent paper: Model atmosphere calculations which incorporate these rates into synthetic spectra."

Our model shows that at the mid-plane of the disk around a MBH = 107M black hole, dust can exist at 0:1pc from the black hole, compared to 0.5pc outside of the disk where such self-shielding is constrained.
We construct a physical model of a disk region approximately located between the radius of dust sublimation at the disk mid-plane and the radius at which dust sublimes at the disk surface. Our main conclusion is that for a wide range of model parameters such as local accretion rate and/or opacity, the accretion disk’s own radiation pressure on dust significantly influences its vertical structure. In this region convection plays important role in the vertical transport of energy. When the local accretion rate exceeds 2:5Myr the 10􀀀2pc-scale disk is super-critical with respect to dust opacity. Such a disk puffs up and transforms from geometrically thin to slim. Our model fits into the narrative of a ""failed wind"" scenario of Czerny & Hryniewicz (2011) and the ""compact torus"" model of Baskin & Laor (2018), incorporating them as variations of the radiative dusty disk model."

Yukon River water typically has low total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), with an average DOC : TDN ratio of 21.1 (mol C mol N−1) ~ 200 km upstream from the coast at Pilot Station, Alaska. TDN has been correlated to the bioavailability of DOC, but a direct estimate of the dependence of DOC reactivity on nutrient availability has not been conducted in the Yukon River delta. The biodegradability of DOC and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was assessed along a gradient within the Yukon River delta and into the coastal ocean. Samples were dark incubated at 20􀀀C and half of the incubations were amended with inorganic nutrients. At ﬁve time points through 27 d, CDOM absorption and DOC concentration were measured. Initial DOC concentration was 113–830 μmol C L−1 and CDOM absorption at 443 nm (a443) ranged from 0.16 to 7.8 m−1 from the ocean to a high CDOM lake. DOC was relatively unreactive, with 3–6% of DOC degrading in riverine samples and little difference between nutrient amended and control incubations. Control river delta a443 decreased 3–10%, while nutrient amended treatments saw a 6–22% decline over 27 d. In the nutrient amended riverine stations, CDOM absorption loss was greater at blue wavelengths and CDOM degradation was greater than total DOC loss. DOC was resistant to biodegradation in both nutrient amended and ambient conditions, while CDOM was preferentially degraded when nutrients were replete."

The approach leverages the use of a predictive process structure, which maps uncertainty sources and their interaction according to the quantity of interest and the goal of the predictive estimation. It is systematic and uses basic elements that are system agnostic, and therefore needs to be tailored according to the specificity of the application. This work is motivated by the interest in low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle operations, where awareness of vehicle and airspace state becomes more relevant as the density of autonomous operations grows rapidly. Predicted scenarios in the area of small vehicle operations and urban air mobility have no precedent, and holistic frameworks to perform prognostics and health management (PHM) at the system- and airspace-level are missing formal approaches to account for uncertainty. At the end of the paper, two case studies demonstrate implementation framework of trajectory tracking and health diagnosis for a small unmanned aerial vehicle. This work has been accepted for publication at the International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management Jan 2021. Minor edits have been incorporated to this original submission to incorporate complete overview and software integration."

Benchmark sets of flow field property data are required in order to assess current CFD capabilities and develop better modeling approaches for these turbulent flow fields where accurate calculation of temperatures and turbulent heat flux is important.  Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), spontaneous rotational Raman scattering (SRS) spectroscopy and Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) have been previously used to acquire measurements of the mean and root mean square (rms) velocities, the mean and rms gas temperatures and density gradients in subsonic jet flows and film cooling flows.  In this work, the ability to measure density is added to the list of measurands available using the acquired Raman spectra.  The suite of measurement techniques are now applied to supersonic jet flows.  The computation of the local gas pressure in the potential core of an over-expanded jet is demonstrated using the Raman measured gas temperature and density.  Additionally, a unique density feature in temperature matched, perfectly expanded jet flow shear layers identified using BOS was verified using the Raman measurement technique.  These non-intrusive flow measurements are compared against RANS predictions of the supersonic jet flow properties as a means of assessing their prediction accuracy."

Their inverted-goblet appearance encloses broad coronal loops at  the  Sun  and  tapers  to  a  narrow  radial  stalk  away  from  the  star.   The  streamer  associated  with the global solar dipole magnetic field is long-lived, predominantly contains a single arcade of nested loops within  it,  and separates  opposite-polarity  interplanetary magnetic fields  with the  heliospheric current sheet anchored at its apex.  Pseudostreamers, on the other hand, are transient, enclose double arcades of nested loops, and separate like-polarity fields with a dense plasma sheet.  We use numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations to calculate, for the first time, the formation of pseudostreamers in response to photospheric magnetic-field evolution.  Convective transport of a minority-polarity flux concentration, initially positioned under one side of a streamer, through the streamer boundary into the adjacent, pre-existing coronal hole forms the pseudostreamer.  Interchange magnetic reconnection at the overlying coronal null point(s) governs the development of the pseudostreamer above – and of anew, satellite coronal hole behind – the moving minority polarity.  The reconnection dynamics liberate coronal-loop  plasma  that  can  escape  into  the  heliosphere  along  so-called  separatrix-web  (“S-Web”)arcs,  which  reach  far  from  the  heliospheric  current  sheet  and  the  solar  equatorial  plane,  and  can explain  the  origin  of  high-latitude  slow  solar  wind.   We  describe  the  implications  of  our  results  for in-situ and remote-sensing observations of the corona and heliosphere as obtained, most recently, by Parker Solar Probe and Solar OrbiteR."

The coefficients 𝛽0, 𝛽1and 𝛽2are obtained from fitting a series of data points (𝑥𝑖, 𝑦𝑖), which is usually done using a least-square method. The LQ and more generally the polynomial fit capability is implemented in many software that analyzes data. However, there are some instances where the fitting needs to be done programmatically.   Furthermore, depending   on   the   software   used, some   features   may not be implemented.  In this mini-review, I discuss the basis of polynomial fitting, including the calculation of errors on the coefficients and results, use of weighting and fixing the intercept value (the coefficient 𝛽0). A simple C++ code to perform the polynomial curve fitting is also provided. This code should be useful not only in radiobiology but in other fields of science as well."

more critical as climate change, in addition to other human activities, alters water availability and
quality. Robust indicators reflecting the effects of climate change on the U.S. and global water
cycles are needed in order to appropriately manage water resources. Here, we describe a suite of
seventeen water cycle and management indicators, which are based on synthesis of available
datasets. These indicators include: average and heavy precipitation, standardized precipitation
index, annual, 7-day low and 3-day high streamflow volume, streamflow timing, snow cover,
snow water equivalent, groundwater level, lake water temperature, stream water temperature,
dissolved oxygen, salinity, Palmer Drought Severity Index, water withdrawals and water use. We
also identify three indicators that could be included in the suite of water cycle and management
indicators with some additional, directed work: snowfall, evapotranspiration and soil moisture.
Our conceptual framework focuses on known water cycle changes in addition to potential effects
on management, and addresses water quantity and quality, as well as water use and related
interactions with freshwater ecosystems, societal impacts, and management. Water cycle
indicators are organized into three categories: (1) hydrologic processes, (2) water quality
processes, and (3) water quality and quantity impacts. Indicators described here are
recommended to serve as critical references for periodic climate assessments. As such, these
indicators support analyses of the effects of global change on the natural environment,
agriculture, energy, and water resources, among other sectors. Additionally, we identify research
gaps and needs that can be addressed to advance the development of future indicators."

The study consisted of determining the compression-after-impact (CAI) strength of candidate carbon/epoxy face sheet sandwich structure that has been identified for potential use to manufacture the PAF hardware. Two types of core material that have been considered for use on the PAF structure were used in this study. One was an aluminum honeycomb and the other was a Rohacell foam. Levels of barely visible impact damage (BVID) were determined for the types of sandwich structure tested in this study and this level of damage was used for CAI strength testing. It was found that the honeycomb core sandwich structure failed by face sheet failure and the foam core sandwich structure failed by core shear failure. CAI strength values were normalized by weight of the sandwich structure since lower mass is desirable for this structure.

The four MMS spacecraft were separated by several hundred km, comparable to suprathermal ion gyro-radius scales or several ion inertial lengths. At least half of the shock reformation cycle was observed, with a new shock ramp rising up out of the “foot” region of the original shock ramp. Using the multipoint observations, we convert the observed time-series data into distance along the shock normal in the shock’s rest  frame.  That  conversion allows for a unique study of the relative spatial scales of the shock’s various features, including the shock’s growth rate, and how they evolve during the reformation cycle. Analysis indicates that: the growth rate increases during  reformation, electron-scale  physics  play  an  important  role  in  the  shock  reformation, and energy conversion processes also undergo the same cyclical periodicity as  reformation.  Strong,  thin electron-kinetic-scale current sheets and large-amplitude electrostatic and electromagnetic waves are reported. Evidence is also presented of nonlinear wave decay from electromagnetic whistler-mode “lion  roars” to electrostatic solitary waves in the  downstream  plasma  regime. Results highlight the   critical cross-scale coupling   between   electron-kinetic-and ion-kinetic-scale processes and details of the nature of nonstationarity, shock-front reformation at collisionless, fast magnetosonic shocks."

Despite the importance, measurements from surface-based instruments are limited in extent and are generally absent from sparsely populated or inhospitable regions, including over the world’s oceans. Satellite-based observations have the potential to provide the necessary information to generate estimates of precipitation across the whole of the Earth’s surface. However, adequate temporal and spatial sampling is required to capture vagaries of precipitation and it is necessary to exploit all possible satellite (and, where appropriate surface) information. While much research has been carried out into the retrieval of precipitation from observations gathered by conically-scanning passive microwave imagers in previous decades, relatively little has been done to fully utilise the observations from the cross-track scanning passive microwave sounding instruments. This paper will review a number of cross-track precipitation retrieval schemes, together an evaluation of their performance, and future directions."

A total of 34% of the sources show parsec-scale emission above the flux density detection limit of 30 mJy; their accurate positions and parsec-scale structure parameters are determined. Among all the sources detected at least at the shortest VLBA baselines, the majority, or 72%, have a steep single-dish spectrum. The fraction of the sources with a detectable parsec-scale structure is above 95% among the flat-spectrum objects and close to 25% among the steep-spectrum objects. We identified 82 compact steep-spectrum source candidates, which make up 17% of the sample; most of them are reported for the first time. The compactness and the brightness temperature of the sources in our sample show a positive correlation with single-dish and VLBA spectral indices. All the sources with a significant 8 GHz variability were detected by the VLBA snapshot observations, which independently confirmed their compactness. We demonstrated that 54% of the sources detected by the VLBA at 2.3 GHz in our sample have a steep VLBA spectrum. The compact radio emission of these sources is likely dominated by optically thin jets or mini-lobes, not by an opaque jet core. These results show that future VLBI surveys aimed at searching for new sources with parsec-scale structure should include not only flat-spectrum sources but also steep-spectrum ones in order to reach an acceptable level of completeness."

The Atmospheric Correction Intercomparison Exercise (ACIX-Aqua), a joint NASA – ESA activity, was initiated to enable a thorough evaluation of eight state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors available for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data processing. Over 1000 radiometric matchups from both freshwaters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) and coastal waters were utilized to examine the quality of derived aquatic reflectances (ρ̂w). This dataset originated from two sources: Data gathered from the international scientific community (henceforth called Community Validation Database, CVD), which captured predominantly inland water observations, and the Ocean Color component of AERONET measurements (AERONET-OC), representing primarily coastal ocean environments. This volume of data permitted the evaluation of the AC processors individually (using all the matchups) and comparatively (across seven different Optical Water Types, OWTs) using common matchups. We found that the performance of the AC processors differed for CVD and AERONET-OC matchups, likely reflecting inherent variability in aquatic and atmospheric properties between the two datasets. For the former, the median errors in ρ̂w560 and ρ̂w664 were found to range from 20 to 30% for best-performing processors. Using the AERONET-OC matchups, our performance assessments showed that median errors within the 15–30% range in these spectral bands may be achieved. The largest uncertainties were associated with the blue bands (25 to 60%) for best-performing processors considering both CVD and AERONET-OC assessments. We further assessed uncertainty propagation to the downstream products such as near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Using satellite matchups from the CVD along with in situ Chla and TSS, we found that 20–30% uncertainties in ρ̂w490≤λ≤743nm yielded 25–70% uncertainties in derived Chla and TSS products for top-performing AC processors. We summarize our results using performance matrices guiding the satellite user community through the OWT-specific relative performance of AC processors. Our analysis stresses the need for better representation of aerosols, particularly absorbing ones, and improvements in corrections for sky- (or sun-) glint and adjacency effects, in order to achieve higher quality downstream products in freshwater and coastal ecosystems."

material applications. BNNT-reinforced composites must exhibit extraordinary mechanical
properties in order to justify the cost premium. Prevailing theory indicates that suitable BNNTs
must possess an aspect ratio (AR= length/diameter) approaching 10,000 to provide effective
discontinuous reinforcement under tensile loading. A survey of commercial products shows that although the quantities are sufficient, lots of uniform morphology are unavailable. Therefore, the opportunity exists to supplement procedures either during synthesis operations or post-synthesis processing in order to deliver homogeneous batches of high AR BNNTs.
An assessment of relevant technologies reveals established methods compatible with sorting of BNNTs by physical dimensions, i.e., size and/or shape. Electrostatic fractionation emerges as the leading candidate, with the potential to isolate high-purity, low-defect, high AR product. The adaptation of existing equipment to the handling of fibrous particulate on the nanoscale will be paramount to success. Although currently focused on BNNTs, the concepts outlined may be applied to nanotubes synthesized from any organic or inorganic compounds. This survey sets the stage for delivering reproducible lots of BNNTs that satisfy the dimensional requirements for use in acreage structural materials."

Their lack of self-supporting tissues and their vertical position on top of the canopy make them strong competitors of resources. A few pioneer studies have shown that liana optical traits differ on average from those of colocated trees. Those trait discrepancies were hypothesized to be responsible for the competitive advantage of lianas over trees. Yet, in the absence of reliable modelling tools, it is impossible to unravel their impact on the forest energy balance, light competition, and on the liana success in Neotropical forests. To bridge this gap, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature to gather all published liana leaf optical spectra, as well as all canopy spectra measured over different levels of liana infestation. We then used a Bayesian data assimilation framework applied to two radiative transfer models (RTMs) covering the leaf and canopy scales to derive tropical tree and liana trait distributions, which finally informed a full dynamic vegetation model. According to the RTMs inversion, lianas grew thinner, more horizontal leaves with lower pigment concentrations. Those traits made the lianas very efficient at light interception and significantly modified the forest energy balance and its carbon cycle. While forest albedo increased by 14% in the shortwave, light availability was reduced in the understorey (−30% of the PAR radiation) and soil temperature decreased by 0.5°C. Those liana-specific traits were also responsible for a significant reduction of tree (−19%) and ecosystem (−7%) gross primary productivity (GPP) while lianas benefited from them (their GPP increased by +27%). This study provides a novel mechanistic explanation to the increase in liana abundance, new evidence of the impact of lianas on forest functioning, and paves the way for the evaluation of the large-scale impacts of lianas on forest biogeochemical cycles."

The 1.347 ± 0.047 RJup planet, initially identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission, orbits TOI-2109 (TIC 392476080)—a T(eff) ∼ 6500 K F-type star with a mass of 1.447 ± 0.077 Mꙩ, a radius of 1.698 ± 0.060 Rꙩ, and a rotational velocity of v sin i =81.9 ± 1.7 km/s. The planetary nature of TOI-2109b was confirmed through radial-velocity measurements, which yielded a planet mass of 5.02 ± 0.75 M(Jup). Analysis of the Doppler shadow in spectroscopic transit observations indicates a well-aligned system, with a sky-projected obliquity of λ = 1.°7± 1.°7. From the TESS full-orbit light curve, we measured a secondary eclipse depth of 731 ± 46 ppm, as well as phase-curve variations from the planet's longitudinal brightness modulation and ellipsoidal distortion of the host star. Combining the TESS-band occultation measurement with a K(s)-band secondary eclipse depth (2012 ± 80 ppm) derived from ground-based observations, we find that the dayside emission of TOI-2109b is consistent with a brightness temperature of 3631 ± 69 K, making it the second hottest exoplanet hitherto discovered. By virtue of its extreme irradiation and strong planet–star gravitational interaction, TOI-2109b is an exceptionally promising target for intensive follow-up studies using current and near-future telescope facilities to probe for orbital decay, detect tidally driven atmospheric escape, and assess the impacts of H2 dissociation and recombination on the global heat transport."

In this study, we first assess the ability of IS2 to estimate thermodynamic ice growth and dynamic thickening during the ice-growing season in the central Arctic Ocean. As an indicator of the thermodynamic ice growth, we use 10 thermistor string-based sea ice mass balance array (SIMBA) buoys deployed at a scale of ~ 50 km from the Icebreaker Polarstern during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. We collect IS2 data within 20 km buffer distance from the individual buoys, and calculate the mode, median, and mean of the IS2-derived ice thickness. The IS2 modal thickness shows the least bias (−0.169 m) with the buoy ice thickness, representing level ice thickness. In addition, the increasing rate of the IS2 modal thickness is close to the thermodynamic ice growth with a small bias of −0.054 cm/day. However, the increasing rates of the IS2 median and mean thickness are greater than the thermodynamic ice growth by about 0.114 cm/day and 0.198 cm/day, respectively, because they also include ice growth caused by thickness redistribution during dynamic deformation. The dynamic contributions may account for 26.1 ± 10.3% and 34.4 ± 10.1% of the total increase of the IS2 median and mean thickness, respectively. Within a ~ 50 km radius area from the MOSAiC Central Observatory, IS2 measurements exhibit that the ridge fraction increased from <2% in November to ~ 4% in March (~0.029%/day of average increasing rate) and ridge height increased about 0.047 cm/day during the same period. However, lead formation does not show significant contributions to the dynamic ice thickening because leads are temporary features lasting only 2–3 days. Although there are considerable uncertainties in IS2 ice thickness estimation and IS2-buoy thickness comparison, this study emphasizes the importance of combining measurements by IS2 and SIMBA buoys to explain the regional sea ice mass balance with separating the thermodynamic and dynamic contributions."

However, soil roughness complicates the relationship between brightness temperature and soil moisture, with current soil moisture retrieval  algorithms typically assuming a constant roughness parameter globally, leading to a potential degradation in retrieval accuracy. This current investigation established a tower-based experiment site in Victoria, Australia. P-band (~40-cm wavelength/0.75 GHz) was compared with L-band (~21-cm  wavelength/1.41  GHz) over random and periodic soil surfaces to determine if there is an improvement in brightness temperature simulation and soil moisture retrieval accuracy for bare soil conditions, due to reduced roughness impact when using a longer wavelength. The results showed that P-band was less impacted by random and periodic roughness than L-band, evidenced by more comparable statistics across different roughness conditions. The roughness effect from smooth surfaces (e.g.,  0.8-cm root-mean-square height and 11.1-cm correlation length) could be potentially ignored at both P- and L-band with satisfactory simulation and retrieval performance. However, for rougher soil (e.g., 1.6-cm root-mean-square height and 6.8-cm correlation length), the roughness impact needed to be accounted for at both P- and L-band, with P-band observations showing less impact than L-band. Moreover, a sinusoidal soil surface with 10-cm amplitude and 80-cm period substantially impacted the brightness temperature simulation and soil moisture retrieval at both P- and L-band, which could not be fully accounted for using the SMOS and SMAP default roughness parameters. However, when retrieving roughness parameters along with soil moisture, the ubRMSE at P-band over periodic soil was improved to a similar level (0.01-0.02 m3/m3) as that of smooth flat soil (0.01 m3/m3), while L-band showed higher ubRMSE over the periodic soil (0.03-0.04 m3/m3) than over smooth flat soil (0.01 m3/m3). Accordingly, periodic roughness effects were reduced by using observations at P-band."

These blooms can be detected using optical radiometers due to the presence of phycocyanin (PC) pigments. The spectral resolution of best-available multispectral sensors limits their ability to diagnostically detect PC in the presence of other photosynthetic pigments. To assess the role of spectral resolution in the determination of PC, a large ( N=905 ) database of colocated in situ radiometric spectra and PC are employed. We first examine the performance of selected widely used machine-learning (ML) models against that of benchmark algorithms for hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance ( R_(rs) ) spectra resampled to the spectral configuration of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of < 6 nm. Results show that the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network applied to HICO spectral configurations (median errors < 65%) outperforms other ML models. This model is subsequently applied to R_(rs) spectra resampled to the band configuration of existing satellite instruments and of the one proposed for the next Landsat sensor. These results confirm that employing MLP models to estimate PC from hyperspectral data delivers tangible improvements compared with retrievals from multispectral data and benchmark algorithms (with median errors between ∼73 % and 126%) and shows promise for developing a globally applicable cyanobacteria measurement approach."

The data assimilation (DA) experiment was conducted across Western Colorado from September 2016 to August 2017. As part of the DA experiments, the impact of a rule-based update was evaluated by comparing snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates via DA (with [ DAv1 ] and without [ DAv2 ] the rule-based update) against SNOTEL SWE measurements. Results confirmed that rule-based update helped minimize SVM controllability issues, and in turn, improved the accuracy of SWE estimates relative to both open loop (OL) and DAv2 . Comparison of SWE estimates from Sentinel-1 DAv1 against SNOTEL SWE revealed that 75% of stations showed improvements in bias and correlation coefficient relative to the OL. Assimilated SWE estimates also showed statistical improvements during both the snow accumulation and snow ablation periods. However, unbiased root mean square error showed a slight increase during the snow ablation period due to the large variability in the electromagnetic response of C-band backscatter over deep and/or wet snow. Improvement of the SWE estimates also resulted in improving river discharge estimates compared to in situ measurements. River discharge using Sentinel-1 DAv1 improved the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency at all available stations. These results suggest that physically constrained SVM can serve as an efficient observation operator for snow mass DA through explicit consideration of the first-order C-band scattering mechanisms over different terrestrial snow conditions."

In MAC 88107, EET 90043, and Kaba, nearly pure  fayalite  (Fa98−100)  associates  with  phyllosilicates,  magnetite,  Fe, Ni-sulfides,  and hedenbergite (Fs~50Wo~50), and occurs in all chondritic components—chondrules, matrices,and  refractory  inclusions.  In  UOCs,  nearly  pure  fayalite  (Fa95−98)  associates  withphyllosilicates and magnetite, and occurs mainly in matrices and fine-grained chondrulerims. Oxygen-isotope compositions of fayalite and magnetite in UOCs, COs, CVs, and MAC 88107 are in disequilibrium with those of chondrule olivine and low-Ca pyroxene phenocrysts, and plot along mass-dependent fractionation lines with slope of~0.5, butdifferent 17O (~+4.3 1.4‰,−0.2 0.6‰,−1.5 1‰, and−1.8 0.8‰, respectively). Based on the mineralogical observations, thermodynamic analysis, O-isotope compositions, and recently reported experimental data, we infer that (1) fayalite and magnetite in COs,CVs, MAC 88107, and UOCs resulted from aqueous fluid–rock interaction on the chondrite parent asteroids that occurred at low local water-to-rock mass ratios (0.1−0.4) and elevated temperatures (~100−300°C), and (2) 17O of fayalite and magnetite reflects O-isotope compositions  of  aqueous  fluids  on  the  host  meteorite  parent  bodies.  The  observed differences in 17O of fayalite–magnetite assemblages in UOCs, CVs, COs, and MAC 88107suggest that water ices that accreted into the ordinary chondrite and carbonaceous chondrite parent asteroids had different 17O, implying spatial and/or temporal variations in O-isotope compositions of water in the protoplanetary disk."

Bias Correction with Satellite Data for Rural Areas,"This work serves as the second of a two-part study to improve surface PM2.5 forecasts in the continental U.S. through the integrated use of multi satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products (MODIS Terra/Aqua and VIIRS DT/DB), multichemical transport model (CTM) (GEOS-Chem, WRF-Chem, and CMAQ) outputs, and ground observations. In Part I of the study, an ensemble Kalman filter (KF) technique using three CTM outputs and ground observations was developed to correct forecast bias and generate a single best forecast of PM2.5 for next day over non rural areas that have surface PM2.5 measurements in the proximity of 125 km. Here, with AOD data, we extended the bias correction into rural areas where the closest air quality monitoring station is at least 125–300 km away. First, we ensembled all of satellite AOD products to yield the single best AOD. Second, we corrected daily PM2.5 in rural areas from multiple models through the AOD spatial pattern between these areas and non rural areas, referred to as “extended ground truth” or EGT, for the present day. Lastly, we applied the KF technique to reduce the forecast bias for next day using the EGT. Our results find that the ensemble of bias-corrected daily PM2.5 from three CTMs for both today and next day show the best performance. Together, the two-part study develops a multimodel and multi-AOD bias-correction technique that has the potential to improve PM2.5 forecasts in both rural and non rural areas in near real time, and be readily implemented at state levels."

The QTDW in CO2 of ∼7 ppmv or 3–4% shows double peak structures at mid and low latitudes of both hemispheres. We compare the SABER measured QTDW disturbance in CO2 and temperature to those in the eCMAM (the extended Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model). Good agreement of QTDW CO2 spatial and temporal variations is seen, especially at southern mid-latitudes. eCMAM outputs are further analyzed to show that the QTDW in CO2 mixing ratio is mainly driven by both vertical transport and meridional advection. Because waves in vertical transport can be derived by temperature disturbance via a so-called adiabatic displacement approach, we can estimate the QTDW in CO2 mixing ratio from the SABER QTDW in temperature assuming meridional advection is weak at low and mid-latitudes."

It is especially challenging for those missions hosting high-performance (e.g., nano-radian/milli-arcsecond class), vibration-sensitive optical sensor payloads with stringent pointing stability requirements. The Nation Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) are planning technically aggressive spaceflight missions that include ultra-high-performance optical payloads with delicate, highly vibration-sensitive scientific and observational instruments. The guidance, navigation, and control community of practice will need to leverage collective experiences and document their best practices and lessons learned to address future micro-vibration challenges. To identify lessons learned and best practices the NASA Engineering & Safety Center sponsored a 2-day Spacecraft LoS Jitter Workshop in late 2019. The workshop’s goal was to provide a multidisciplinary forum to elicit deeper understanding of the issues related to addressing the spacecraft LoS jitter/micro-vibration problem. The primary objective was to identify, document, and share lessons learned, best practices, and preferred options for jitter-related analysis and test activities. Representatives from NASA, ESA, along with NASA’s industrial partners, independent consultant subject matter experts, and members of academia participated in the workshop.

In the present study, we use data from in-situ and remote-sensing observations and the NASA Unified WRF (NU-WRF) model to investigate the sources and interannual variations of the springtime fine-mode dust over western North America. The horizontal distribution, seasonality, and interannual variability of the springtime dust over the region are characterized with observations of fine dust concentrations at the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) sites and dust optical depth (DOD) from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements. We have conducted detailed modeling and analysis for April in selected years of 2005, 2008, and 2009, to understand the causes of interannual variabilities of the springtime dust with model experiments that separate the dust generated from local deserts with that transported across the Pacific Ocean. The results suggest that although several permanent deserts and semi-arid regions in the western North America are the major source of surface fine dust concentrations in the immediate vicinity, long-range transpacific transported dust is a dominant dust source in springtime, especially over the coastal regions and areas remote from the local deserts. Interannual variability of fine dust over western North America is explained with both local dust emission and long-range transported dust."

A notable difference between these two subpopulationsis the prevalence of widely spaced, equal-mass binaries in the CCB, and a much smaller but non-zero number in the HCB.The primary reason for this difference in binary rate remains unclear. Here usingN-body simulations we examine whetherclose encounters with the giant planets during an early outer Solar system instability may have disrupted primordial Kuiperbelt binaries that existed within the primordial Kuiper belt before they attained HCB orbits. We find that such encounters arevery effective at disrupting binaries down to separations of∼1% of their Hill radius’ (as measured in the modern Kuiper belt),potentially explaining the paucity of widely spaced, equal mass binaries in the modern HCB. Moreover, we find that the widestbinaries observed in the modern HCB are quite unlikely to survive planetary encounters, but these same planetary encounterscan widen a small subset of tighter binaries to give rise to the small population of very wide binaries seen in today’s HCB."

The NASA mission started a dedicated field experiment in May 2019 by deploying two temporary soil moisture networks in northeast US that cover two separate SMAP pixels with variable degree of forest cover. The measurements will be augmented with two intensive observation periods (IOP). The first IOP is planned for July and the other one for October. The IOPs will see deployment of the airborne PALS (Passive Active L-band sensor) instrument, which is similar to the SMAP instrument, and intensive manual measurements of soil moisture and vegetation. The measurements also include tower-based radiometer observations with ground truth measurements within the instrument footprint. The early results have shown that the SMAP measurement signal at L-band is sensitive to soil moisture changes observed on the ground."

In the hybrid method, the multiple scattering within a single wheat plant is first captured using the T-matrix of vec- tor cylindrical waves calculated from the full-wave solutions of HFSS. In the second step, the scattering among different plants is considered using the Foldy-Lax equations of multiple scattering theory (MST) and the extracted T-matrix. The transmission of microwaves through wheat field at the L-, S- and C-bands are calculated using the hybrid method. Results show that: (1) the transmission obtained from the full-wave simulations is much larger than those computed from the radiative transfer equations (RTE) model, (2) the hybrid method transmission has a weaker frequency dependence than those of the RTE, and (3) the attenuation caused by the vegetation layer would saturate with an increase in frequency."

Improvements in RPS specific power and more flexible geometries were recently investigated by JPL and PNNL as part of a study on cryobot devices for exploring Ocean Worlds. Missions to penetrate ice and explore oceans, such as on Europa, will require RPS with high specific power within the vehicle to provide both heat and power. Such missions will be mass-constrained, and the energy required to penetrate the ice is highly dependent on cryobot size. Therefore, compact RPS geometries are needed to maximize heat and power while minimizing 238Pu inventory. Microsphere-based heat sources are an attractive way to obtain flexible geometries and high volumetric power loadings because they can fill a region of any size and shape provided fuel temperatures are kept below a threshold and launch/re-entry safety are not compromised. The sol-gel technique to produce 238PuO2 microsphere particles for heat sources has the benefit of preventing dust generation, as opposed to the current 238PuO2 powder/pellet processing method, reducing hazards in the fuel fabrication line. Microspheres can also be individually coated to enhance thermal conductivity, and/or reduce the likelihood of 238PuO2 fuel dispersal in an accident. Although PNNL has produced 238PuO2 microspheres using the sol-gel method, the application of coatings and their integrity over time has yet to be investigated. Continued R&D could demonstrate the feasibility of advanced, microspherebased heat sources and provide baseline data for planning future missions requiring new RPS with different heat source configurations."

Unfortunately, elec- tric propulsion’s low-thrust capabilities require long thrusting arcs that make space- craft susceptible to disturbances resulting in missed thrust events. One method for designing trajectories resilient to such missed thrust events is expected thrust frac- tion, which embeds their stochastic nature into a time-varying duty cycle. This paper investigates the application of expected thrust fraction to the Earth Return Orbiter’s outbound Earth-to-Mars trajectory and compares it with trajectories de- signed using traditional methods to mitigate missed thrust events. Through the use of expected thrust fraction, a trajectory with a baseline 65.4% success rate is im- proved to an 86.6% success rate at the cost of only a 12 kg reduction in delivered mass. Additionally, when expected thrust fraction is used in conjunction with a terminal coast, a 96.0% success rate is achieved, which is higher than any single mitigation technique."

The most poleward region, designated the “swirl region” by Grodent et al. (2003), https://doi.org/10.1029/2003ja010017, exhibits a high color ratio, while low color ratio emissions are found within the collar around the swirl region but still poleward of the main emission. We confirm the apparent strong magnetospheric local time control within the polar collar (Grodent et al., 2003, https://doi.org/10.1029/2003ja010017), with the dusk side bright “active region” emissions extending from ∼11 to 22 hr of magnetospheric local time. These bright emissions dim by at least an order of magnitude between ∼0 and 11 hr magnetospheric local time, in the midnight to dawn side “dark region.” This magnetospheric local time structure holds true even when the entire northern oval is located on the night side of the planet (in ionospheric local time), a geometry unstudied prior to Juno, as it is unobservable from Earth. The swirl region brightens at ionospheric dawn (∼5–7 ionospheric local time) and diminishes or completely disappears at ionospheric local times of ∼20–22 hr. Finally, the southern auroral polar emissions appear to share all of the local time dependencies of its northern counterpart, but at a reduced intensity"

This was acceptable since the uplink from a single ground antenna makes use of very accurate trajectory information where the radiated frequency is Doppler compensated. However, in the desire to conserve ground resources, the technique of Multiple Uplinks per Antenna (MUPA) is being considered when using a single ground antenna to uplink to a constellation of spacecraft within its beam. This single frequency technique requires the use of non-standard signal acquisition techniques since the constellation may realize different orbits and trajectories around a planetary body leading to varying Doppler offsets and dynamics at each member spacecraft. In such a case, a Type 2 tracking loop may not suffice. An earlier study discussed the various methods for acquiring signals in spacecraft receivers with uncompensated Doppler at the uplink station. In the earlier study, three methods of achieving acquisition and lock were discussed for signals with large Doppler frequency offsets as well as high dynamics; 1) a step-and-sweep signal search algorithm, 2) an FFT signal search algorithm, and, 3) on-board tuning of the signal using uploaded trajectory information or lookup tables. On-board tuning appeared a feasible solution given the trend towards utilizing software-defined radios (SDRs). In the absence of on-board tuning, a search algorithm (e.g., step-and-sweep or FFT) could be utilized in the SDR. One such consideration is in the design of the tracking loop filter, where a Type 3 loop may be more amenable to handling large uncompensated Doppler effects. This report presents an analysis of comparing performance of Type 2 versus Type 3 carrier tracking loops when acquiring and tracking signals with large Doppler dynamics."

On-board the Psyche spacecraft is experimental demonstrator technology that will allow scientists to explore the capabilities of optical communications – a program called Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC) led by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). DSOC seeks to improve communications performance by developing a space-based Flight Laser Transceiver (FLT) and a ground-based transceiver to enable photon-efficient communications with equipment in deep space. An integral part to this FLT system is a high-efficiency photon-counting camera (PCC) that is able to detect both the 1064nm uplink/beacon laser photons and 1550nm downlink laser photons with low background noise, and is capable of withstanding the rigors of space-travel. The paper details the characterization of several asynchronous Geiger-Mode Avalanche Photodiode (GmAPD) arrays developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory for use in the PCC- specifically evaluating the temperature dependence of background noise, photon detection efficiency at 1064nm and 1550nm wavelengths, pixel lifetime testing, and angle of acceptance measurements. The results of this characterization are used to determine the nominal conditions for the device to operate in while in flight to maintain an efficient link with the ground-based transceiver."

In order to meet the needs of its diverse customer base, DSN relies on the Mission Support Definition and Commitments Office to interface with its customers and to develop, negotiate, and document the appropriate service commitments to meet each mission’s needs. Members of this office provide the needed support throughout each mission’s lifetime. While DSN’s primary focus in recent years has been supporting scientific missions by robotic spacecraft deployed across the solar system, the network is ramping-up to provide support for human spaceflight (HSF) endeavours to the moon and beyond, starting with the Artemis missions which aim to land humans on the lunar surface in the 2020’s. These HSF missions pose unique challenges for the DSN, including technical, operational, and programmatic concerns. Examples of challenges in each of these areas are provided, along with descriptions of how they are being addressed and open issues remaining."

These links are susceptible to non Gaussian and non linear effects such as atmospheric turbulence, scintillation, antenna mis-pointing, jitter, etc. These dynamic links thus will experience various degrees of fading loss, and some of these link disruptions cannot be effectively mitigated by forward error correction coding and/or interleaving. One effective way to ensure reliable communication is by using Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol, where the receiver acknowledges to the transmitter whether or not a data unit is successfully received. If a data unit is not successfully received (such as after a pre-set time-out), the transmitter would then re-transmit the lost data unit to the receiver.   In a previous paper, we derived a statistical link analysis method of finding the optimal operating Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and estimating the latency of an ARQ scheme. In a more recent paper, we demonstrated the above method using the SNR distribution constructed from the Ka-band (32 GHz) flight data. To simplify the discussion, we considered the academic approach that the ARQ scheme allows for an infinite number of retransmissions.  In this paper, we consider the more practical case of a truncated ARQ scheme, where there is a limit on the number of retransmissions. We derive the error probability, the optimal SNR setting, and the latency statistics of the correctly received frames of the truncated ARQ schemes. We first discuss the truncated ARQ link analysis principles using the Gaussian assumption for SNR distribution with a large variance. Next, we demonstrate the statistical truncated ARQ link analysis using the SNR distribution constructed from the Ka-band flight data. The results in this paper can be applied in the design of reliable communication systems such as the Consultative Committee for Space Data System (CCSDS) File Transfer Protocol (CFTP) and the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN)."

Indeed, their data requirements are low enough that bandwidth regulations do not constrain the system. In contrast, spacecraft such as Kepler or Europa Clipper are transitioning to a new operational paradigm where engineering and science data are transmitted through simultaneous links operating at different frequency bands (henceforth termed multi-band links). This ensures, for instance, that critical data is correctly received using a well characterized X-band link, while science data at a much larger data rate can be returned efficiently (both in terms of bandwidth and energy) through a Ka-band link.Having a spacecraft establish two simultaneous links with a ground station opens a large span of potential improvements for space communications and mission operations. In this paper, we consider the problem of running a Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) session over a multi-band link. LTP is an implementation of a selective Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocol, i.e. it ensures correct delivery of data over an error prone link with potentially long propagation delays. To maximize its efficiency in deep space environments, LTP operates in deferred-ACK mode and is typically included as one of the core protocols in the Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) suite.The contributions of this paper are as follows: First, we propose an extension to LTP for multi-band links (denoted MBLTP) and sketch how it can be implemented without modifying the current definition of LTP data units. Next, we develop bounds on the performance of MBLTP when transmitting a single data file over a multi-band link. Three metrics are considered, file expected delivery time, total energy spent and bundle jitter. The results of the analytic model are first benchmarked against simulations to ensure validity, and then compared against the performance of both traditional LTP and Parallel LTP (PLTP).We demonstrate that MBLTP can significantly reduce the latency and jitter with which data products are delivered to destination over a deep space link compared to LTP at moderate energy cost. Similarly, we also demonstrate that MBLTP outperforms PLTP in all considered metrics."

Thus, it is desirable to match this formalism in thermal polarimetry and report the  unnormalized  Stokes  parameters  in  units  of K instead  of  radiance  (Wm−2sr−1).   This  approach  also  al-lows common performance metrics in long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging such as Noise Equivalent DifferentialTemperature (NEDT) to be modified and extended to metrics of polarimetric accuracy and precision.  However, since the relationship between measured radiance and Tb are non-linear, the conversion of I, Q, and U in units of radiance to Tb,Tb,Q, and Tb,U in K is ambiguous.  As a solution a metric of performance for thermal linear Stokes polarimetry, the Stokes resolved differential temperature (SRDT), is introduced."

In this study, we address this issue by improving the convective microphysics scheme in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5.3 (CAM5.3). The improvements include: (1) considering sedimentation for cloud ice crystals that do not fall in the original scheme, (2) applying a new terminal velocity parameterization that depends on the environmental conditions for convective snow, (3) adding a new hydrometeor category, “rimed ice,” to the original four-class (cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain, and snow) scheme, and (4) allowing convective clouds to detrain snow particles into stratiform clouds. Results from the default and modified CAM5.3 models were evaluated against observations from the U.S. Department of Energy Tropical Warm Pool-International Cloud Experiment (TWP-ICE) field campaign. The default model overestimates ice amount, which is largely attributed to the underestimation of convective ice particle sedimentation. By considering cloud ice sedimentation and rimed ice particles and applying a new convective snow terminal velocity parameterization, the vertical distribution of ice amount is much improved in the midtroposphere and upper troposphere when compared to observations. The vertical distribution of ice condensate also agrees well with observational best estimates upon considering snow detrainment. Comparison with observed convective updrafts reveals that current bulk model fails to reproduce the observed updraft magnitude and occurrence frequency, suggesting spectral distributions be required to simulate the subgrid updraft heterogeneity."

Recent studies documented positive trends in gross primary productivity (GPP) for Arctic boreal biomes driven by warming, but it is unclear how GPP trends are affected by wildfires. Here, we used satellite vegetation observations and environmental data with a diagnostic GPP model to analyze recovery from large fires in Alaska over the period 2000‐2019. We confirmed earlier findings that warmer‐than‐average years provide favorable climate conditions for vegetation growth, leading to a GPP increase of 1 Tg C/yr, contributed mainly from enhanced productivity in the early growing season. However, higher temperatures increase the risk of wildfire occurrence leading to direct carbon loss over a period of 1‐3 years. While mortality related to severe wildfires reduce ecosystem productivity, post‐fire productivity in moderately burned areas shows a significant positive trend. The rapid GPP recovery following fires reported here might be favorable for maintaining the region’s net carbon sink, but wildfires can indirectly promote the release of long‐term stored carbon in the permafrost. With the projected increase in severity and frequency of wildfires in the future, we expect a reduction of GPP and therefore amplification of climate warming in this region."

As most Arctic tracers and aerosols are transported from midlatitude source regions, long-range transport into the Arctic is one of the key factors to understand the current and future states of Arctic climate. While previous studies have investigated the airmass fraction and transit time distribution in the Arctic, the actual transport pathways and their underlying dynamics and efficiencies are yet to be understood. In this study, we implement a large ensemble of idealized tagged pulse passive tracers in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 5 to identify and analyze summertime transport pathways from different Northern Hemisphere surface regions into the Arctic. Three different transport pathways are identified as those associated with fast, intermediate and slow time scales. Midlatitude tracers can be transported into the Arctic in the troposphere via the fast transport pathway (~8 days), which moves tracers northward from the source region mainly through transient eddies. For the intermediate transport pathway, which happens on 1~3 weeks’ time scales, midlatitude tracers are first zonally transported by the jet stream, and then advected northward into the Arctic over Alaska and northern North Atlantic. Tropical and subtropical tracers are transported into the Arctic lower stratosphere via the slow transport pathway (1~3 months), as the tracers are lifted upward into the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, and then transported into the Arctic following the isentropic surfaces."

A true GGCM will need to include a dynamic plasmasphere for both physics and space weather prediction. Such inclusion requires that we answer longstanding, fundamental questions about the life cycle of core (<10 eV,  plasmaspheric) plasma: how it gets into the inner magnetosphere, and how it is eroded. 

Erosion and refilling are processes controlling a fundamental space plasma population. During every geomagnetic disturbance, tens of metric tons of plasma are rapidly eroded away, then slowly and unevenly replenished.  After several decades we still do not understand the cross-scale mechanisms proposed to be responsible for these 2 processes. Removal and replacement of this enormous plasma mass is as important to the dynamics of the magnetosphere as solar-wind driving. Our community must dedicate the resources and effort needed to solve this enduring puzzle. 

Other white papers submitted in response to the HP2050 call are discussing cold plasma and ionospheric outflow in more general contexts. This white paper deals specifically with the science justification for studying refilling and erosion."

In response to this, rules were created called the Lightning Launch Commit Criteria (LLCC) that help weather personnel evaluate the potential for natural and rocket-triggered lightning. One of the ten LLCC with the least research is called the Thick Cloud Layers rule. To further understand electrification of thick cloud layers and potentially improve the Thick Cloud Layers rule, a database of thick cloud layers that occurred over the Eastern Range was created. This database is then used to create an algorithm for identifying and differentiating thick cloud layers from other cloud types based on radar characteristics, temperature levels in reference to cloud height, and the surface electric field. By analyzing and identifying thick cloud events, this project could help narrow down when thick clouds are occurring and potentially minimize unnecessary launch delays.

Events that caused LLCC violations involving the Thick Cloud Layers rule were analyzed by hand using Level-2 NEXRAD radar data from the National Weather Service WSR-88D radar in Melbourne with the program GR2Analyst. Cases that were found to be isolated and not involved with convection were recorded (date, start/end time, location) in a database. Radar data associated with these cases was collected and gridded using Python radar packages. Once gridded, I calculated and recorded for each radar scan the following radar reflectivity driven parameters within an 11x11 km bin centered on each 1 square km grid point: the mean reflectivity colder than 0 degrees Celsius, Maximum Radar Reflectivity (MRR) colder than 0 degrees Celsius, Volume Averaged Height Integrated Radar Reflectivity (VAHIRR), Hydrometeor Identification (HID), the difference between the maximum and mean reflectivity, the cloud depth colder than 0 degrees Celsius, the overall cloud depth, the cloud top, and the cloud bottom. Soundings for each event were used to determine cloud temperature levels, and where the cloud is in relation to the freezing level. Electric field mill data collected over the Eastern Range was used to determine surface electric fields below each cloud. All parameters were analyzed in depth for several thick cloud cases to gain an understanding of typical thick cloud characteristics. Cases of thick clouds and other isolated cloud types were also recorded for training purposes to see if enough differences exist between cloud types to differentiate them with an algorithm. Each case along with its corresponding characteristics was recorded in a database, and this database was used to compare differing cloud types, as well as train the algorithm to detect thick clouds."

The goal of this study was to characterize the NIR emission of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in planetary nebulae and study the evolution of PAH features within these objects. Using airborne 3-5.4 micron grism spectroscopy of three young, Carbon-rich planetary nebulae: IC 5117, PNG 093.9-00.1, and BD +30 3639, we investigated the spectral variation of the 3.3 micron PAH feature, its associated aliphatic features (3.4-3.6 microns), characterized the weak 5.25 PAH emission feature, and set limits on the theoretical contribution of the 4.4-4.8 micron deuterated-PAH features. All features, including atomic emission lines, were fit with a series of Gaussians to determine their flux. We further characterized the 3.3 micron PAH feature using equivalent width and central wavelength, and classified the shape of the emission.  We also determined the PAH/Aliphatic ratio for each target. The 3.3 micron PAH emission feature is observed in all three objects, as is PAH emission at 5.25 microns. PNG 093.9-00.1 exhibits NGC 7027-like aliphatic emission in the 3.4–3.6 micron region while aliphatic emission in  IC 5117 and BD +30 3639 is weaker, and exhibits less structure."

These environmental exposures can result in erosion, embrittlement and optical property degradation of susceptible materials threatening spacecraft performance and durability. To increase our understanding of effects such as AO erosion and radiation induced embrittlement of spacecraft materials, NASA Glenn Research Center has developed a series of experiments that are flown as part of the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) missions on the exterior of the International Space Station (ISS).  These experiments have provided critical space environmental durability data such as AO erosion data of polymers and composites, and radiation induced mechanical property degradation of spacecraft insulation materials, after long term space exposure. In continuing these studies, four Glenn experiments have been flown on ISS’s MISSE-Flight Facility (MISSE-FF).  These experiments are the Polymers and Composites Experiment-1 (PCE-1) flown as part of the inaugural MISSE-9 mission, the PCE-2 flown as part of the MISSE-10 mission, the PCE-3 being flown as part of the MISSE-12 mission, and the PCE-4 being flown as part of the MISSE-13 mission.

This   is   the   first governmental-level policy document that calls for CubeSats to follow quantitative recommendations for orbital debris mitigation. While CubeSats were never exempt from such recommendations, mission designers   often   “under   assess”   CubeSats   due   to their small size and historically low level of stored energy. Qualitative assessments of debris potential are less applicable as miniaturized energy systems (propulsive and electrical) become more available and   as   the   “CubeSat”   label   is   applied   to   larger payloads.   Of   particular   interest   to   the   long-term evolution   of   the   debris   environment   is   the likelihood of accidental explosion or collision; we must also consider the risk to the human population from reentering spacecraft.

These limitations are what motivates In-Space Assembly (ISA) and where Inertial Transfer has potential to improve or augment ISA capabilities by utilizing a multiagent autonomous system to transport untethered payloads. The Inertial Transfer concept is presented including autonomy capabilities, potential risks, and three system configurations. These configurations are based on the autonomous system’s available sensor coverage that tracks the payload’s state. Participating agents have well-defined roles, expectations, and assumptions in their physical organization and coordination of actions depending the mode of operation. The sensor information available to participating agents is considered as it affects the uncertainty in the estimated state and the actions required to capture the payload."

The 2-parameter Weibull distribution is usually assumed when working with ceramic and glasses such as Zerodur®, although 3-parameter behavior is occasionally considered [2].  Detailed statistical modeling of the Zerodur® strength data with the was initial perspective of a 3-parameter Weibull distribution gave unsatisfying results [3].  The subsequent fractographic investigation indicated [1] that the usual assumption of many small, random, noninteracting flaws [4] was not represented, but instead, less frequent, aligned flaws along etching ridges parallel to the grinding direction were present, Figure 1.  It was thus concluded that the strength of Zerodur® as prepared was not Weibull distributed.  The flaws represent a sparse flaw population relative to typical grinding damage, but an extensive occurrence (high frequency) of handling damage.  We examine the type of distribution present and explain the appearance of a 3-parameter distribution."

This paper represents a continuation of our numerical investigation of the flow instabilities over the main test surface of the BOLT configuration by using state-of-the-art tools in multidimensional instability analysis. Specifically, the paper extends our previous computations by considering the separate effects of a nonzero angle of attack and a nonzero yaw on the modal instability characteristics of the boundary layer streaks adjacent to the minor-axis symmetry plane, specifically near both ends of the azimuthal region of a thick boundary layer in the middle, where this region rapidly changes to a thinner boundary layer on either side. At the t = 28.8767 s condition from the ascent part of the anticipated flight trajectory with a flight Mach number of M<sub>∞</sub> = 5.53 and unit Reynolds number of 4.25 x 10<sup>6</sup>/m, either type of departure from the design condition is shown to have a considerable impact on the structure of the basic state rollup within the region of interest and, hence, also on the amplification characteristics of instability waves within the resulting streaks. Yet, for a yaw angle of β = 4 degrees, the computations indicate only a slight reduction with respect to the peak N-factor of nearly 11 at the design condition of zero degrees yaw and zero degrees angle of attack. In contrast, an angle of attack equal to α = 4 degrees, the peak N-factor decreases to nearly 6 on the leeward side and increases above 16 on the windward side, making the onset of transition highly likely on the windward side. Computations also highlight the role of streak instabilities that originate as Mack mode disturbances and also demonstrate the potential pitfalls in using surface pressure sensors alone to gauge the magnitude of instability amplification."

In April 2019, the Hayabusa2 mission successfully completed an artificial impact experiment on the carbonaceous near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu (Arakawa et al., 2020), which provided an opportunity to investigate the effects of radiative heating through the exposed subsurface material. Here we report observations of the Ryugu’s subsurface material by the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3) on the Hayabusa2 spacecraft. Spectra of the subsurface material exhibit a slightly stronger and peak-shifted hydroxyl absorption feature compared to that observed for the surface, indicating that space weathering and/or radiative heating caused a subtle change in the spectrum of Ryugu surface. However, the shape of the absorption feature still suggests that the subsurface material experienced heating above 300 ˚C similar to the surface. In contrast, our thermal modeling shows that radiative heating does not increase the subsurface temperature at 1 m depth above 200 ˚C even if the semimajor axis is reduced down to 0.344 au. This supports that the Ryugu material would have been preferentially altered due to radiogenic and/or impact heating on the parent body rather than radiative heating."

The relationship is measurement-based and does not rely on assumptions about the aerosol size distribution. In this respect, it may be a unique tool to verify the performance of interactive aerosol models used in GCMs and ESMs and may suggest an avenue for improving aerosol extinction coefficient measurements from single channel observations such the Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imager System. We note limitations on this analysis including that the presence of significant amounts of ash in the main aerosol layer may significantly modulate these results."

Here, total columns from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) were intercompared to boundary layer NH3 profiles derived from aircraft- and surface-based measurements primarily in Colorado, USA, in the summer of 2014. IASI-NH3 version 3 near real-time dataset compared well to in-situ derived columns (windows ±15 km around centroid, ±1 hour around overpass time) with a correlation of 0.58, a slope of 0.78±0.14, and an intercept of 2.1×10(exp 15)±1.5×10(exp 15) molecules cm(exp -2) . Agreement degrades at larger spatiotemporal windows, consistent with the short atmospheric lifetime of NH3. We also examined IASI version 3R data, which relies on temperature retrievals from the ERA Reanalysis, and a third product generated using aircraft-measured temperature profiles. The overall agreement improves slightly for both cases, and neither is biased within their combined measurement errors. Thus, spatiotemporal averaging of IASI over large windows can be used to reduce retrieval noise. Nonetheless, sampling artifacts of airborne NH3 instruments result in significant uncertainties of the in-situ-derived columns. For example, large validation differences exist between ascent and descent profiles, and the assumptions of the free tropospheric NH3 profiles used above the aircraft ceiling significantly impact the validation. Because short-lived species like NH3 largely reside within the boundary layer with complex vertical structures, more comprehensive validation is needed across a wide range of environments. More accurate and widespread in-situ NH3 datasets are therefore required for improved validations of satellite products."

Despite the strength of the observed connection, global climate models do not produce an MJO-QBO link. Here the authors use a current-generation ocean-atmosphere coupled NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies global climate model (Model E2.1) to examine the MJO-QBO link. To represent the QBO with minimal bias, the model zonal mean stratospheric zonal and meridional winds are relaxed to reanalysis fields from 1980-2017. The model troposphere, including the MJO, is allowed to freely evolve. The model with stratospheric nudging captures QBO signals well, including QBO temperature anomalies. However, an ensemble of nudged simulations still lacks an MJO-QBO connection."

Lake water can then hydrofracture a crevasse to the base of the ice sheet, and river inputs can
maintain this connection as a moulin. If future ice sheet models are to accurately represent moulins, we must understand their formation processes, timescales, and locations. Here,
we use remote-sensing velocity products to constrain the relationship between strain rates and lake drainages across ∼ 1600 ksq.m in Pâkitsoq, western Greenland, between 2002–2019. We find significantly more extensional background strain rates at moulins associated with fast-draining lakes than at slow-draining or non-draining lake moulins. We test whether moulins in more extensional background settings drain their lakes earlier, but we find insignificant correlation. To investigate the frequency at which strain-rate transients are associated with fast lake drainage, we examined Landsat-derived strain rates over 16 and 32 d periods at moulins associated with 240 fast-lake-drainage events over 18 years. A low signal-to-noise ratio, the presence of water, and the multi-week repeat cycle obscured any resolution of the hypothesized transient strain rates. Our results support the hypothesis that transient strain rates drive fast lake drainages. However, the current generation of ice sheet velocity products, even when stacked across hundreds of fast lake drainages, cannot resolve these transients. Thus,  observational progress in understanding lake drainage initiation will rely on field-based tools such as GPS networks and photogrammetry."

The system is primarily being developed at the Glenn Research Center with support from Johnson Space Center under the Space Technology Mission Directorate / Game Changing Development Program. Currently, the intent is to operate the RFC system in an equivalent environment to a lunar equator location for a period of several lunar day/night cycles with minimal operator input. Demonstrating an automated RFC system in this environment is a step towards showing the extensibility to a flight system. This paper describes the RFC software team’s approach for development of the monitoring and control software that allows for the automated operation of the RFC system. We describe the rationale for the choice of Core Flight System architecture, as well as the plan for software/hardware integration."

One such potentially underutilized concept is the fluted-core sandwich composite, which consists of facesheets separated by angled web members, and has a number of potential advantages over traditional-core (honeycomb, foam, etc.) sandwich composites. However, fluted-core sandwich composites also exhibit a behaviors not seen with traditional-core sandwich composites. For example, stable local buckling that can lead to material failure can occur in the facesheets between webs or in the webs themselves. Additionally, in the direction perpendicular to the webs, the effective transverse-shear stiffness is largely determined by the bending stiffnesses of the facesheets and the webs and is generally much lower than in the direction parallel to the webs. These local buckling and transverse-shear behaviors can have a large influence on material failure and global buckling, respectively. Thus, it is important to accurately characterize and model these behaviors. In this report, a series of experiments designed to elicit some of these fluted-core sandwich composite structural responses is discussed and the results are compared with results from a previously developed finite element analysis approach; qualitative and quantitative agreement between the experiment and analysis is shown."

An array of fluidic oscillators was used to control flow separation.  The results showed that the fluidic oscillators were able to achieve substantial control over the separated flow by increasing the upstream suction pressure and downstream pressure recovery. Using the data available in the literature, the performance of the fluidic oscillators was compared to other active flow control (AFC) methods such as steady blowing, steady suction, and zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) actuators.  Several integral parameters, such as the inviscid flow comparison coefficient, pressure drag coefficient, and modified normal force coefficient, were used as quality metrics in the performance comparison of the AFC methods. These quality metrics indicated the superiority of the steady suction method, especially at lower excitation amplitudes that is followed by the fluidic oscillators, steady blowing, and the ZNMF actuators,  respectively.   An aerodynamic figure of merit (AFM) was also constructed using the integral parameters and AFC power usage.  The AFM results revealed that, for this study, steady suction was the most efficient AFC method at lower excitation amplitudes. The steady suction loses its efficiency as the excitation amplitude increases, and the fluidic oscillators become the most efficient AFC method. Both the steady suction and the fluidic oscillators have an AFM > 1 for the range tested in this study, indicating that they provide a net benefit when the AFC power consumption is also considered.  On the other hand, both the steady blowing and ZNMF actuators were found to be inefficient AFC methods (AFM < 1) for the current configuration. Although they improved the flow field by controlling flow separation, the power requirement was more than their benefit."

In this study, palladium and deuterium atoms were co-deposited on a cathode at stoichiometric densities, forming dendritic morphologies. Bubble detector neutron dosimeters were used to measure equivalent dose levels during electrolytic deposition. Standard configuration cells expected to produce excess neutrons were denoted as experimental cells and contained an electrolyte consisting of palladium(II) chloride, lithium chloride, and heavy water. The control cells used copper(II) chloride, lithium chloride, and heavy water electrolyte. Experimental and control cells were supplied current, increasing from 0.1 to 100.0 mA over a period of 20 days. For test days 9 through 20, the standard configuration experimental cells exhibited significantly higher average neutron radiation than the controls at a 99% confidence level. Alternative configurations involving more increasing current over a shortened time scale, substitutions of water in place of heavy water or potassium chloride for lithium chloride, as well as inclusion of depleted uranium near the cell cathodes all resulted in inconclusive evidence for promoting neutron production."

Machine vision systems, based on standard optics and visible light detectors, possess the ideal size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements for sUAS. This work presents the design and analysis of a novel aircraft detection and tracking pipeline based on optical sensing alone. Key contributions of the work include a refined range inequality model based on sensing and detection with FAA well-clear separation  assurance  distances between  aircraft in  mind, a detector fusion method to maximize the benefit of two image detectors, and a comparative analysis of Linear Kalman-filtering and Extended Kalman-filtering to seek optimal tracking performance. The pipeline is evaluated offline against multiple intruder platforms, using two types of flight encounters: multirotor sUAS vs. fixed-wing sUAS and multirotor sUAS vs. general aviation(GA)plane. Analysis  is  restricted  to  the  rate-limiting  head-on and departing  collision  volume cases vertically separated for safety. Results indicate that it is feasible to use the proposed optical spatial-temporal tracking algorithm to provide adequate alerting time to prevent penetration of well-clear separation volumes for both sUAS and GA aircraft."

We also analyze near-IR spectra from Gemini that cover Hαfor a portion of the lensed arc.  We report fluxes for 42 detected emission lines, and upper limits for an additional22.  This galaxy has extreme emission line ratios and high equivalent widths that are characteristic of extreme emission-line galaxies.  We compute strong emission line diagnostics from both the rest-frame optical and rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), to constrain physical conditions and test the spectral diagnostics themselves.  We tightly determine the nebular physical conditions using the most reliable diagnostics, and then compare to results from other diagnostics.  We find disappointing performance from the UV–only diagnostics: they either are unable to measure the metallicity or dramatically under-estimate it; they over-estimate the pressure; and the UV diagnostic of ionization parameter has a strong metallicity dependence in this regime.  Based on these results, we suggest that upcoming James Webb Space Telescope(JWST) spectroscopic surveys of galaxies in the reionization epoch should invest the additional integration time to capture the optical [O II] and [O III] emission lines, and not rely solely on the rest-frame UV emission lines.  We make available the spectra; they represent one of the highest-quality emission line spectral atlases of star-forming galaxy available beyond the local universe, and will aid planning observations with JWST."

Recent high-resolution observations have challenged this picture by revealing numerous transient, small-scale, collimated out-flows (“jetlets”) at the base of plumes.  The dynamic filamentary structure of solar plumes above these outflows, and its relationship with the overall plume structure, have remained largely unexplored.   We analyzed the statistics of continuously observed fine structure in-side a single representative bright plume within a mid-latitude coronal hole during 2016 July2-3. By applying advanced edge-enhancement and spatiotemporal analysis techniques to ex-tended series of high-resolution images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, we determined that the plume was composed of numerous time-evolving filamentary substructures, referred to as “plumelets” in this paper, that accounted for most of the plume emission.  The number of simultaneously identifiable plumelets was positively correlated with plume brightness, peaked in the fully formed plume, and remained saturated thereafter.  The plumelets had transverse widths of 10 Mm and intermittently supported upwardly propagating periodic disturbances with phase speeds of 190-260 km s−1and longitudinal wavelengths of 55-65 Mm. The characteristic frequency (3.5 mHz) is commensurate with that of solar p-modes. Oscillations in neighboring plumelets are uncorrelated, indicating that the waves could be driven by p-mode flows at spatial scales smaller than the plumelet separation.  Multiple independent sources of outflow within a single coronal plume should impart significant fine structure to the solar wind that may be detectable by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter."

project is working towards a general yet practical toolkit and
knowledge base to help usher in the era of new technologies
for space systems communications, such as optical links. The
High-Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (HDTN) implementation
falls under the umbrellas of both the toolkit and the knowledge
base, as its advancements illuminate more general areas of Delay
Tolerant Networking (DTN) that need growth. The goal of
this paper is to explore the usage of particular mathematical
machineries, namely temporal flow networks and sheaves, to
identify fundamental, underlying structures in DTN for space
systems.
Satellites, space assets, ground stations, etc. give rise to a disconnected network, and it is the goal of DTN to glue disparate links
together into a cohesive system, that is, a network. Depending on
a given link, the latencies might be beyond that which the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) can handle, and contact times
might have one-way light times in excess of minute (sometimes
significantly longer). Some links might be periodic (say, due to
orbital mechanics) or they might not be. This diversity has made
it difficult to probe the underlying structure. An immediate
consequence is that DTNs in practice today are controlled by
globally distributed contact plans (schedules), which are the
input to the contact graph routing (CGR) algorithm. While this
is effective for smaller networks, it will be very difficult to scale
for future networks. Deeper and more rigorous theory is needed
to bring DTN to the next evolutionary step.
To this end, this paper introduces and suggests a mathematical
framework for DTN, and applies it to a space network that is
simulated using an orbital analysis toolkit. The tag-line for the
structure known as sheaves is that they are the mathematically
precise way of gluing local data together into unique, global
data. If we consider routing, we see that networking is a
“sheafy” science. We then discuss a simplified sheaf model,
known as the cellular sheaf. The sheaf-theoretic analysis is presented and discussed, as it is hoped that this and related papers
will help form the primordial ooze of DTN theory. Finally there
is a section of future work suggesting follow-on research."

Essential investigations of this question will help us to further mitigate exploration risks for future human explorers on the Moon and will also provide critical information for astrobiologists and space biologists using the Moon for scientific inquiry.

Apollo 14 dust biotoxicity studies, carried out by the NASA Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Assessment Group (LADTAG), included numerous cellular and animal experiments. Intratracheal instillation and inhalation studies in rats both showed Apollo 14 dust to be intermediate in toxicity compared to low-tox titanium dusts and high-tox quartz dusts of similar particle sizes. The collective results were used in models to establish a safe exposure limit for astronauts. Although LADTAG took extensive steps to preserve what chemical reactivity may still have existed in the samples, it is simply unknown if they possessed true in-situ chemical reactivity or if that reactivity has decayed. Initial gas loss on collection and other alterations, and even intermittent exposure to Earth-normal conditions during subsequent decades of handling, obscure a forensic reconstruction of the initial state.

Because a mineral dust’s chemical reactivity influences its biotoxicity, researchers have developed methods to “activate” lunar dust and simulants. Past studies that modeled impact processes and radiation in the lunar environment suggest that in-situ lunar dust is likely to be more chemically reactive than Earth-exposed samples. Because of these results, in-situ measurements are warranted. Since the lunar surface is heterogeneous, dust biotoxicity is expected to vary from site to site due to particle size, mineralogy, physical characteristics, degree of space weathering, and chemical reactivity. This circumstance dictates dust assessments at a suite of lunar sites enabled by CLPS opportunities.

Dose, location, and duration of particle exposure will also affect biological responses. In-situ chemical reactivity measurements can inform cross-cutting collaborative research campaigns such as astrobiology studies examining regolith interactions with organisms and its ability to preserve chemical and structural biomarkers, as well as space biology investigations that examine regolith-microbe interactions relating to life support systems, plant growth, biomining, and development of regolith biocomposites."

This has a number of limitations, with the most significant being bias towards the detection of culturable organisms and the inherent delay between sample collection and ground-based analysis. In recent years, portable and easy-to-use molecular-based tools, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION™ sequencer and miniPCR bio’s miniPCR™ thermal cycler, have been validated onboard the ISS. Here, we report on the development, validation, and implementation of a swab-to-sequencer method that provides a culture-independent solution to real-time microbial profiling onboard the ISS. Method development focused on analysis of swabs collected in a low-biomass environment with limited facility resources and stringent controls on allowed processes and reagents. ISS-optimized procedures included enzymatic DNA extraction from a swab tip, bead-based purifications, altered buffers, and the use of miniPCR and the MinION. Validation was conducted through extensive ground-based assessments comparing current standard culture-dependent and newly developed culture-independent methods. Similar microbial distributions were observed between the two methods; however, as expected, the culture-independent data revealed microbial profiles with greater diversity. Protocol optimization and verification was established during NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) analog missions 21 and 22, respectively. Unique microbial profiles obtained from analog testing validated the swab-to-sequencer method in an extreme environment. Finally, four independent swab-to-sequencer experiments were conducted onboard the ISS by two crewmembers. Microorganisms identified from ISS swabs were consistent with historical culture-based data, and primarily consisted of commonly observed human-associated microbes. This simplified method has been streamlined for high ease-of-use for a non-trained crew to complete in an extreme environment, thereby enabling environmental and human health diagnostics in real-time as future missions take us beyond low-Earth orbit."

GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) high frequency channels can clearly detect intense shallow convective snowfall events. However, GMI Goddard PROfiling (GPROF) QPE retrievals produce inconsistent results when compared against the Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor (MRMS) ground-based radar reference dataset. While GPROF retrievals adequately capture intense snowfall rates and spatial patterns of one event, GPROF systematically underestimates intense snowfall rates in another event. Furthermore, GPROF produces abundant light snowfall rates that do not conform with MRMS observations. Ad-hoc precipitation rate thresholds are suggested to partially mitigate GPROF’s overproduction of light snowfall rates. The sensitivity and retrieval efficiency of GPROF to key parameters (2-meter temperature, total precipitable water, and background surface type) used to constrain the GPROF a-priori retrieval database are investigated. Results demonstrate that typical lake-effect snow environmental and surface conditions, especially coastal surfaces, are underpopulated in the database and adversely affect GPROF retrievals. For the two presented case studies, using snow cover a-priori database in the locations of originally deemed as coastline improves retrieval. This study suggests that it is particularly important to have more accurate GPROF surface classifications and better representativeness of the a-priori databases to improve intense lake-effect snow detection and retrieval performance."

Cloud feedback persistently appears as the main source of disagreement in future projections while the combined lapse-rate plus water vapor (LR+WV) feedback is a smaller (30%), but non-trivial source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity. Here we attempt to observationally constrain the feedbacks in an effort to reduce the irintermodel uncertainties. The observed interannual variation provides a useful constraint on the long-term cloud feedback, as evidenced by the consistency of global-mean values and regional contributions to the  intermodal spread on both interannual and long-term timescales. However, interannual variability does not serve to constrain the long-term LR+WV feedback spread, which we find is dominated by the varying tropical relative humidity (RH) response to interhemispheric warming differences under clear-sky conditions and the RH-fixed LR feedback under all-sky conditions"

Wefind that the shape of the far-infrared polarization spectrum is variable across the cloud and that there is evidence of a correlation between theslope of the polarization spectrum and the average line-of-sight temperature. The slope of the polarization spectrumtends to be negative(falling toward longer wavelengths)in cooler regions and positive orflat in warmer regions.This is very similar to what was discovered inρOph A via SOFIA polarimetry at 89 and 154μm. Like the authorsof this earlier work, we argue that the most natural explanation for our falling spectra is line-of-sight superpositionof differing grain populations, with polarized emission from the warmer regions and less-polarized emission fromthe cooler ones. In contrast with the earlier work onρOph A, we do notfind a clear correlation of polarizationspectrum slope with column density. This suggests that falling spectra are attributable to variations in grainalignment efficiency in a heterogeneous cloud consistent with radiative torques theory. Alternative explanations inwhich variations in grain alignment efficiency are caused by varying gas density rather than by varying radiationintensity are disfavored."

We provide a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty in projected crop yields for maize, spring and winter wheat, rice, and soybean, using a suite of nine crop models and up to 45 CMIP5 and 34 CMIP6 climate projections for three different forcing scenarios. To make this task computationally tractable, we use a new set of statistical crop model emulators. We find that climate and crop models contribute about equally to overall uncertainty. While the ranges of yield uncertainties under CMIP5 and CMIP6 projections are similar, median impact in aggregate total caloric production is typically more negative for the CMIP6 projections (+1% to −19%) than for CMIP5 (+5% to −13%). In the first half of the 21st century and for individual crops is the spread across crop models typically wider than that across climate models, but we find distinct differences between crops: globally, wheat and maize uncertainties are dominated by the crop models, but soybean and rice are more sensitive to the climate projections. Climate models with very similar global mean warming can lead to very different aggregate impacts so that climate model uncertainties remain a significant contributor to agricultural impacts uncertainty. These results show the utility of large-ensemble methods that allow comprehensively evaluating factors affecting crop yields or other impacts under climate change. The crop model ensemble used here is unbalanced and pulls the assumption that all projections are equally plausible into question. Better methods for consistent model testing, also at the level of individual processes, will have to be developed and applied by the crop modeling community."

The initial CubeSat standard was created in 1999 by California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo
and Stanford University’s Space Systems Development Lab to facilitate direct access to space for university students. This initial CubeSat standard has now been adopted by hundreds of organizations worldwide and includes not only universities, educational institutions, but private firms and government
organizations. Dozens of CubeSats have been launched since 2003 and have come from more than 29 states in the United States. The CubeSat standard facilitates frequent and affordable access to space with launch opportunities available on most launch vehicles.

CubeSats are a class of research spacecraft called nanosatellites and are built to standard CubeSat Units or U dimensions of 10 by 10 by 10 cm and are formally classified as 1U, 2U, 3U, or 6U in size. Most CubeSats are deployed from a Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer called a P-POD. Partnerships among NASA, U.S. industry, and educational institutions are being formed to build upon existing successful CubeSat initiatives with a goal to expand and include launching 50 small satellites from 50 states within the next several years.

An extensive and detailed literature review that includes over 830 citations has been conducted to provide a comprehensive resource on both NASA and non-NASA CubeSat experiments and applications that can serve as a guide for background information on CubeSats as well as a valuable resource of lessons learned from CubeSats that have been launched in the past.

CubeSats are currently being launched from all over the world on different launch vehicle platforms. Some organizations providing launch opportunities are California Polytechnic State University (http://www.cubesat.org/contactus), ISISPACE Group (https://www.isispace.nl/), Nanoracks (http://nanoracks.com/), Spaceflight Industries, Inc.

The on-orbit change of the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) value, quantified by a numerical factor called the H-factor, is determined by the onboard SD stability monitor. Our previous study showed that the H-factor is solar angle and view direction dependent. In this study, we determine the dependence of the H-factor on the detector SD view footprint location. We fit an empirical model to the NASA Collection 1 SNPP VIIRS Level 1B (L1B) spectral reflectance difference across the detectors in an RSB over uniform Earth scenes of the Libya 4 desert and deep convective clouds. We apply the model predicted SD positional dependent H-factor to calibrate the RSBs. Under this new calibration scheme, the original unreal striping is removed from the homogeneous Libya 4 desert and the deep convective cloud images, as well as the original unreal striping from the Dunhuang desert image. The SD positional dependent H-factor has been used to calculate the SNPP VIIRS RSB radiometric correction factor for the NASA Collection 2.0 SNPP VIIRS L1B products."

The models are similar to CMIP6/AerChemMIP Earth System Models (ESMs) and provide a robust multi-model ensemble. Inter-model spread of aerosol species lifetimes and emissions appears to be similar to that of mass extinction coefficients (MECs), suggesting that aerosol optical depth (AOD) uncertainties are associated with a broad spectrum of parameterised aerosol processes.

Total AOD is approximately the same as in AeroCom phase I (AP1) simulations. However, we find a 50 % decrease in the optical depth (OD) of black carbon (BC), attributable to a combination of decreased emissions and lifetimes. Relative contributions from sea salt (SS) and dust (DU) have shifted from being approximately equal in AP1 to SS contributing about 2∕3 of the natural AOD in AP3. This shift is linked with a decrease in DU mass burden, a lower DU MEC, and a slight decrease in DU lifetime, suggesting coarser DU particle sizes in AP3 compared to AP1.

Relative to observations, the AP3 ensemble median and most of the participating models underestimate all aerosol optical properties investigated, that is, total AOD as well as fine and coarse AOD (AODf, AODc), Ångström exponent (AE), dry surface scattering (SCdry), and absorption (ACdry) coefficients. Compared to AERONET, the models underestimate total AOD by ca. 21 % ± 20 % (as inferred from the ensemble median and interquartile range). Against satellite data, the ensemble AOD biases range from −37 % (MODIS-Terra) to −16 % (MERGED-FMI, a multi-satellite AOD product), which we explain by differences between individual satellites and AERONET measurements themselves. Correlation coefficients (R) between model and observation AOD records are generally high (R>0.75), suggesting that the models are capable of capturing spatio-temporal variations in AOD. We find a much larger underestimate in coarse AODc (∼ −45 % ± 25 %) than in fine AODf (∼ −15 % ± 25 %) with slightly increased inter-model spread compared to total AOD. These results indicate problems in the modelling of DU and SS. The AODc bias is likely due to missing DU over continental land masses (particularly over the United States, SE Asia, and S. America), while marine AERONET sites and the AATSR SU satellite data suggest more moderate oceanic biases in AODc.

Column AEs are underestimated by about 10 % ± 16 %. For situations in which measurements show AE > 2, models underestimate AERONET AE by ca. 35 %. In contrast, all models (but one) exhibit large overestimates in AE when coarse aerosol dominates (bias ca. +140 % if observed AE < 0.5). Simulated AE does not span the observed AE variability. These results indicate that models overestimate particle size (or underestimate the fine-mode fraction) for fine-dominated aerosol and underestimate size (or overestimate the fine-mode fraction) for coarse-dominated aerosol. This must have implications for lifetime, water uptake, scattering enhancement, and the aerosol radiative effect, which we can not quantify at this moment.

Comparison against Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) in situ data results in mean bias and inter-model variations of −35 % ± 25 % and −20 % ± 18 % for SCdry and ACdry, respectively. The larger underestimate of SCdry than ACdry suggests the models will simulate an aerosol single scattering albedo that is too low. The larger underestimate of SCdry than ambient air AOD is consistent with recent findings that models overestimate scattering enhancement due to hygroscopic growth. The broadly consistent negative bias in AOD and surface scattering suggests an underestimate of aerosol radiative effects in current global aerosol models.

Considerable inter-model diversity in the simulated optical properties is often found in regions that are, unfortunately, not or only sparsely covered by ground-based observations. This includes, for instance, the Sahara, Amazonia, central Australia, and the South Pacific. This highlights the need for a better site coverage in the observations, which would enable us to better assess the models, but also the performance of satellite products in these regions.

Using fine-mode AOD as a proxy for present-day aerosol forcing estimates, our results suggest that models underestimate aerosol forcing by ca. −15 %, however, with a considerably large interquartile range, suggesting a spread between −35 % and +10 %."

Many prior experiments have shown that trailing edge serrations can reduce this noise, but the mechanism by which serrations reduce noise and their aerodynamic impact near the edge is not fully understood. Previous theoretical models have assumed that the turbulence convecting past a serrated trailing edge is unchanged by the presence of the serrations, but experiments have shown that this is not accurate. This work attempts to further the understanding of unsteady surface pressure fluctuations on sawtooth serrations. Experiments were performed in an anechoic wall-jet wind tunnel on an undercut trailing edge with a straight and serrated edge configuration. The magnitude of unsteady surface pressure fluctuations was found to increase near the tips of the serrations for Strouhal numbers near 0.5 based on edge thickness. Spanwise coherence was increased on a single serration, while
coherence across the root of adjacent serrations was similar to results across a straight trailing edge at similar spanwise separation distance."

New tree-ring  reconstructions of May–July mid-tropospheric ridging and soil moisture anomalies back to 1500 CE in the central United States — a hotspot for flash drought — suggest that over the last five centuries, anomalies in these two variables combined to indicate flash-drought conditions in ~17% of years and exceptionally severe flash drought in ~4% of years, similar to frequencies in recent decades. However, over one-third of all inferred exceptional flash droughts occurred since 1900, suggesting the 20th century was highly flash-drought prone. These results may guide future work to diagnose the roles of external, oceanic, and land-surface forcing of warm-season atmospheric circulation and hydroclimate over North America."

Following different insults to the CNS, microglia turn into a “reactive” state characterized by the production of inflammatory mediators that promote tissue repair to restore homeostasis. If inflammation is not in check, chronic microglia activation results in damage to the brain and leads to persistent cognitive impairments.

Low-cost PM sensors are especially beneficial in low and middle-income countries where few, if any, reference grade measurements exist and in areas where the concentration fields of air pollutants have significant spatial gradients. Unfortunately, low-cost PM sensors also come with a number of challenges that must be addressed if their data products are to be used for anything more than a qualitative characterization of air quality. The various PM sensors used in low-cost monitors are all subject to biases and calibration dependencies, corrections for which range from relatively straightforward(e.g. meteorology, age of sensor) to complex (e.g. aerosol source, composition, refractive index). The methods for correcting and calibrating these biases and dependencies that have been used in the literature likewise range from simple linear and quadratic models to complex machine learning algorithms. Here we review the needs and challenges when trying to get high-quality data from low-cost sensors. We also present a set of best practices to follow to obtain high-quality data from these low-cost sensors."

The slosh model parameters are typically predicted using semi-empirical analytical methods that are based on experimental data for high liquid-to-gas density ratios (such as water and air at standard sea level conditions). Model parameter calculations typically neglect any contribution to slosh dynamics from the gas phase.  However, some cryogenic propellant systems operate in conditions where the density ratio can be orders of magnitude smaller.  Analytical and computational modeling was used in this effort to investigate the effects of liquid-to-gas density ratio on slosh dynamics. No experimental data nor previous studies are available at this time that quantify the effect of liquid-to-gas density ratio on slosh dynamics. However, in a recent CFD study, results showed that density ratio can have a significant effect on slosh model parameters. In this study, a dual pendulum slosh model was created that distinctly represents both liquid and gas phase dynamics. Solution of the model, which invokes the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, demonstrates that slosh frequency is a combination of liquid slosh frequency and gas phase slosh frequency. Additionally, it shows that slosh mass is reduced due to the opposing motion of the gas phase with respect to that of the liquid phase. The slosh model parameter trends were verified using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis results for various liquid-to-gas density ratios, tanks, and fill levels."

Monitoring the contributions of human-induced climate forcings to warming so far is key to understanding progress towards these goals. Here we use climate model simulations from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project, as well as regularized optimal fingerprinting, to show that anthropogenic forcings caused 0.9 to 1.3 °C of warming in global mean near-surface air temperature in 2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900, compared with an observed warming of 1.1 °C. Greenhouse gases and aerosols contributed changes of 1.2 to 1.9 °C and −0.7 to −0.1 °C, respectively, and natural forcings contributed negligibly. These results demonstrate the substantial human influence on climate so far and the urgency of action needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals."

The NASA research-level Aircraft Noise Prediction Program was used to predict the noise from each source component on the ND8 to build up a noise estimate for the full aircraft. The propulsion airframe aeroacoustic effects of the ND8 (namely, boundary-layer ingestion, with its influence on fan noise; and the noise shielding, reflection, and diffraction mechanisms of the unconventional airframe) were empirically modeled using experimental data. Far-term noise reduction technology concepts were modeled and added to the noise prediction to evaluate the low-noise potential of the ND8 in the far-term timeframe. Results indicate that the increase in fan noise due to boundary-layer ingestion, as well as the lack of aft shielding, prevents the aircraft from approaching NASA’s noise goals for either the midterm or far term. The aircraft achieves margins to Stage 4 of only 9.4 and 17.3 effective perceived noise in decibels (EPNdB) in the midterm and far-term configurations, respectively, compared with goals of 32–42 EPNdB in the midterm and 42-52 EPNdB in the far term."

Since then 10 more advanced instruments, but based on the same basic measurement principle, have been launched on polar orbiting NASA and NOAA satellites. The datasets produced by these instruments are unique for they have captured the period before the onset of the decline of the ozone layer due to manmade chemicals, the declining period, and the present slow recovery period. This period includes the rapid development of the iconic anthropocene era feature called the “Ozone Hole” . However, stitching together data from 11 separate satellite instruments to create a homogeneous record has presented many challenges. The first two NASA instruments suffered considerable degradation after launch that required the development of novel techniques to characterize their calibration. The next 7 instruments were launched on NOAA’s polar orbiting weather satellites that were not designed for long-term monitoring of climate variables. In particular, they didn’t have the station keeping capabilities needed to maintain a stable equator crossing time. Drifting orbits not only stress the retrieval algorithm and the calibration system of UV instruments but also make the interpretation of data difficult because the upper stratospheric ozone has systematic
and complex diurnal variabilities that are comparable to the anthropogenic signal one wants to extract. We will highlight our recent efforts in untangling this knot. Finally, we will discuss the results from the OMPS limb scattering instrument, a recent addition to this constellation, that has been operating on the Suomi NPP satellite since October 2011. It is helping us capture how the ozone layer in the lower stratosphere and troposphere is evolving in response to the climate change and rising chemical pollutants in some parts of the world, while the upper stratosphere
slowly recovers due to phaseout of the chemicals that initiated the decline of the ozone layer in the late 70s."

Prior studies support improved air quality under NTCF mitigation, but with conflicting climate impacts that range from a significant reduction in the rate of global warming to only a modest impact. Here, we use state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model simulations conducted as part of the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) to quantify the 21st-century impact of NTCF reductions, using a realistic future emission scenario with a consistent air quality policy. Non-methane NTCF (NMNTCF; aerosols and ozone precursors) mitigation improves air quality, but leads to significant increases in global mean precipitation of 1.3% by mid-century and 1.4% by end-of-the-century, and corresponding surface warming of 0.23 and 0.21 K. NTCF (all-NTCF; including methane) mitigation further improves air quality, with larger reductions of up to 45% for ozone pollution, while offsetting half of the wetting by mid-century (0.7% increase) and all the wetting by end-of-the-century (non-significant 0.1% increase) and leading to surface cooling of -0.15 K by mid-century and -0.50 K by end-of-the-century. This suggests that methane mitigation offsets warming induced from reductions in NMNTCFs, while also leading to net improvements in air quality."

Understanding the mechanisms for this response via climate modelling and comparing the models' representation of climate reconstructions is one of the objectives set up by the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project for its contribution to the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Here we analyse the results from 16 climate models in terms of Arctic sea ice. The multi-model mean reduction in minimum sea ice area from the pre industrial period (PI) to the LIG reaches 50 % (multi-model mean LIG area is 3.20×10^6 sq.km, compared to 6.46×10^6 sq.km for the PI). On the other hand, there is little change for the maximum sea ice area (which is 15–16×10^6 sq.km for both the PI and the LIG. To evaluate the model results we synthesise LIG sea ice data from marine cores collected in the Arctic Ocean, Nordic Seas and northern North Atlantic. The reconstructions for the northern North Atlantic show year-round ice-free conditions, and most models yield results in agreement with these reconstructions. Model–data disagreement appear for the sites in the Nordic Seas close to Greenland and at the edge of the Arctic Ocean. The northernmost site with good chronology, for which a sea ice concentration larger than 75 % is reconstructed even in summer, discriminates those models which simulate too little sea ice. However, the remaining models appear to simulate too much sea ice over the two sites south of the northernmost one, for which the reconstructed sea ice cover is seasonal. Hence models either underestimate or overestimate sea ice cover for the LIG, and their bias does not appear to be related to their bias for the pre-industrial period. Drivers for the inter-model differences are different phasing of the up and down short-wave anomalies over the Arctic Ocean, which are associated with differences in model albedo; possible cloud property differences, in terms of optical depth; and LIG ocean circulation changes which occur for some, but not all, LIG simulations. Finally, we note that inter-comparisons between the LIG simulations and simulations for future climate with moderate (1 %/yr) CO2 increase show a relationship between LIG sea ice and sea ice simulated under CO2 increase around the years of doubling CO2. The LIG may therefore yield insight into likely 21st century Arctic sea ice changes using these LIG simulations."

These two aspects are not necessarily independent of each other, especially during solar maximum when multiple eruptive events can occur close in time.  Accordingly, we present in this work theanalysis of a CME that erupted from the Sun on 2012 May 11 (SOL2012-05-11) and an SEP event following an eruption that took place on 2012 May 17 (SOL2012-05-17),∼20◦in both latitude and longitude away from the May 11 CME source region.  After observing in detailthe eruption and early evolution of the May 11 CME using remote-sensing data from three viewpoints, we evaluate its propagation through interplanetary space using several models.Then, we analyse in-situ measurements from five predicted impact locations (Venus, Earth, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Mars Science Laboratory en route to Mars, and Mars) in the inner heliosphere in order to search for CME signatures.  We find that all five in-situlocations detect signatures of an impulsive SEP event, which we trace back to the May 17 eruption.   These  findings  suggest  that  the  May  11  CME,  which  was  crossing  the  various locations around the time of the May 17 eruption, provided a direct magnetic connectivityfor the efficient transport of SEPs with an impulsive profile.  We discuss the space weather implications of CME evolution, regarding in particular its magnetic structure, and CME-driven IMF preconditioning that facilitates SEP transport from a later event.  Finally, this work remarks the importance of the availability of data from multiple spacecraft, even those that do not include space weather research as their primary objective."

To analyze this problem we developed multi-scale physics-based approach that spans atomistic dynamics at the scale of nanoseconds and the full part shrinkage at the time scale of hours. Using this approach we estimated
the key parameters of the problem including grain boundary width, coefficient of surface diffusion, initial redistribution of particles during debinding stage, micro-structure evolution from round particles to densely packed grains and corresponding change of the total and chemical free energy, and sintering stress. The introduced method was used to predict shrinkage at the level of two particles, filament cross-section, sub-model, and the whole green, brown, and metal parts. To further improve accuracy and reliability of the shrinkage predictions we propose concept of intelligent additive manufacturing of metal powders in space that combines the strengths of both physics-based and data-driven methods of analysis of AM."

High-density performance-based routes or corridors enable prompt transportation of people and goods from node to node, where each node represents a vertiport, defined as an identifiable ground or elevated area used for the takeoff and landing of VTOL aircraft. In the presence of uncertainty surrounding aircraft turnaround time on the ground, vertiports are the critical end points in scheduling, sequencing, and spacing (SSS) of aircraft in dense metropolitan environments. This Concept of Operations (ConOps) includes vertiports of varying sizes, configurations, service offerings, and locations. UAM air vehicles include conventional rotorcraft, unmanned VTOL aircraft, and novel piloted VTOL aircraft.

Independent satellite laser ranging (SLR) measurements are withheld from the POD solutions and used as an independent arbiter of POD performance. Measurement model updates in the form of estimated GPS antenna phase center and satellite laser ranging retro-reflector tracking point offset vectors as well as a GPS antenna phase center variation map have led to significant improvement in POD performance. GPS residual analysis and orbit precision analysis show no significant anomalous temporal or geographic POD performance issues. The independent SLR residual analysis indicates that POD solutions have achieved a radial orbit accuracy just below 1.5 cm, thus exceeding the mission radial orbit accuracy requirement of 3.0 cm by more than a factor of 2. Future POD processing updates have been identified and will lead to even further improvements in POD performance."

After landfall, tropical cyclones typically weaken due to the exhaustion of a moisture supply. Cyclone Kelvin continued to intensify with winds gusting to 100 knots and significant flooding well inland. A distinct eye feature also formed well after landfall. An analysis of meteorological satellite, MERRA2reanalysis, and Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) data was employedin a case study of Cyclone Kelvin.

We examine linkages between surface runoff, transient subglacial water storage, and short-term ice motion from 168 consecutive hourly measurements of meltwater discharge (moulin input) and GPS-derived ice surface motion for Rio Behar, a ∼60 sq. km moulin-terminating supraglacial river catchment on the southwest Greenland Ice Sheet. Short-term accelerations in ice speed correlate strongly with lag-corrected measures of supraglacial river discharge (r = 0.9, τ = 0.7, p < 0.01). Though our 7 days record cannot address seasonal-scale forcing, diurnal ice accelerations align with normalized differenced supraglacial and proglacial discharge, a proxy for subglacial storage change, better than GPS-derived ice surface uplift. These observations counter theoretical steady state basal sliding laws and suggest that moulin and proglacially induced fluctuations in subglacial water storage, rather than absolute subglacial water storage, drive short-term ice accelerations."

Multispectral remote sensing instruments onboard space-borne platforms such as Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) have shown to be useful for efficiently generating timely and synoptic information on the yield status of crops across regional levels. However, the coarse spatial resolution data inherent to these sensors provides little utility at the management level. Recent satellite imagery collection advances toward finer spatial resolution (down to 1 m) alongside increased observational cadence (near daily) implies information on crops obtainable at field and within-field scales to support farming needs is now possible. To test this premise, we focus on assessing the efficiency of multiple satellite sensors, namely WorldView-3, Planet/Dove-Classic, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 (through Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS)), and investigate their spatial, spectral (surface reflectance (SR) and vegetation indices (VIs)), and temporal characteristics to estimate corn and soybean yields at sub-field scales within study sites in the US state of Iowa. Precision yield data as referenced to combine harvesters’ GPS systems were used for validation. We show that imagery spatial resolution of 3 m is critical to explaining 100% of the within-field yield variability for corn and soybean. Our simulation results show that moving to coarser resolution data of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m reduced the explained variability to 86%, 72%, and 59%, respectively. We show that the most important spectral bands explaining yield variability were green (0.560 µm), red-edge (0.726 µm), and near-infrared (NIR - 0.865 µm). Furthermore, the high temporal frequency of Planet and a combination of Sentinel-2/Landsat 8 (HLS) data allowed for optimal date selection for yield map generation. Overall, we observed mixed performance of satellite-derived models with the coefficient of determination (R^2) varying from 0.21 to 0.88 (averaging 0.56) for the 30 m HLS and from 0.09 to 0.77 (averaging 0.30) for 3 m Planet. R^2 was lower for fields with higher yields, suggesting saturation of the satellite-collected reflectance features in those cases. Therefore, other biophysical variables, such as soil moisture and evapotranspiration, at similar fine spatial resolutions are likely needed alongside the optical imagery to fully explain the yields."

It rotates very slowly and shows nitrogen excess. Its surface magnetic field is much more complex than a purely dipolar configuration which is unusual for a magnetic massive star. We employ the CMFGEN radiative transfer code to determine the fundamental parameters and surface CNO and helium abundances. Then, we employ MESA and GENEC stellar evolution models accounting for the effects of surface magnetic fields. To reconcile τ Sco’s properties with single-star models, an increase is necessary in the efficiency of rotational mixing by a factor of 3–10 and in the efficiency of magnetic braking by a factor of 10. The spin-down could be explained by assuming a magnetic field decay scenario. However, the simultaneous chemical enrichment challenges the single-star scenario. Previous works indeed suggested a stellar merger origin for τ Sco. However, the merger scenario also faces similar challenges as our magnetic single-star models to explain τ Sco’s simultaneous slow rotation and nitrogen excess.
In conclusion, the single-star channel seems less likely and versatile to explain these discrepancies, while the merger scenario and other potential binary-evolution channels still require further assessment as to whether they may self-consistently explain the observables of τ Sco."

For instance, molten salt electrolyte batteries require conditions far above room temperature to operate. Therefore, discovering mixtures with increasingly lower eutectic melting points is desirable. A model that can approximate chemical activity is a valuable tool to search through the vast compositional design space. Machine learning can predict properties of materials such as vibrational free energies, electronic energy gaps, and thermal conductivities. Moreover, they can learn physical models such as interatomic potentials. 

The COSMO-SAC model uses theory and empirical parameterization to predict liquid-vapor and liquid-solid properties using first-principles calculations. However, obtaining activity coefficients required for parameterizing the COSMO-SAC model is costly and limited to a select chemical space. 

In this work, we explored if machine learning methods could improve the COSMO-SAC model and bridge density functional theory calculations to liquid phase thermodynamic properties. Our data-driven approach uses existing databases for sigma-profiles of organic solvents and reconciles their methodological differences via ensemble averaging. First, an optimal machine learning model is constructed for each dataset. Our machine learning algorithms use the sigma-profile as an input feature to predict binary mixtures' activity coefficients using multi-output regression. Each dataset uses different choices of functionals, methods, and basis sets. Therefore, our ensemble model attempts to predict corrected activity coefficients given the combination of all the model outputs. The activity coefficients used for training are generated using the COSMO-SAC model. This approach enables the extraction of meaningful information from the existing datasets to improve the COSMO-SAC model for obtaining thermodynamic properties of electrolyte mixtures. With the liquid phase activities, we can identify electrolyte mixtures that meet desired phase equilibria conditions."

Plans for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) during that period envision highly automated airspace management systems and electrically powered vehicles. AAM concepts also anticipate limited human roles. The goal of limiting the human role is to minimize the potential for misadventures, yet how the human role is limited needs to be carefully considered in order to also preserve the potential for human successes. The field of resilience engineering (RE) focuses on how systems can change in order to seize an opportunity or withstand an unforeseen challenge. RE methods rely on the use of empirical data to optimize the ability of any system to adapt. RE studies have shown how individual and team initiatives ensure resilient system performance by creating safety through flexibility. Benefits of the RE approach include improved awareness of operational circumstances and how system elements depend on each other, and the ability to allocate limited resources and prepare for surprise. RE offers the ability to account for and incorporate the human role as an essential element in order to ensure NAS systems’ resilient performance. Data on the human contribution to safe and resilient system performance, which is termed “work as done,” are available but are not being considered as the NAS evolves. We present an approach that describes how use of RE can enable the evolving NAS to adapt, and perform, in a resilient manner."

GEOS-CF offers a new tool for atmospheric chemistry research, with the goal to supplement NASA’s broad range of space-based and in-situ observation sand to support flight campaign planning, support of satellite observations, and air quality research. GEOS-CF expands on the GEOS weather and aerosol modeling system by introducing the GEOS-Chem chemistry module to provide analyses and 5-day forecasts of atmospheric constituents including ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The chemistry module integrated in GEOS-CF is identical to the offline GEOS-Chem model and readily benefits from the innovations provided by the GEOS-Chem community.Evaluation of GEOS-CF against satellite, ozone sonde and surface observations show realistic simulated concentrations of O3, NO2, and CO, with normalized mean biases of -0.1 to -0.3, normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) between 0.1-0.4, and correlations between 0.3-0.8. Comparisons against surface observations highlight the successful representation of air pollutants under a variety of meteorological conditions, yet also highlight current limitations, such as an over prediction of summertime ozone over the Southeast United States. GEOS-CFv1.0 generally overestimates aerosols by 20-50% due to known issues in GEOS-Chem v12.0.1 that have been addressed in later versions.The 5-day hourly forecasts have skill scores comparable to the analysis. Model skills can be improved significantly by applying a bias-correction to the surface model output using a machine-learning approach."

Monitoring the state of droughts depends on integrating multiple indicators that each capture particular aspects of hydrologic impact and various types and phases of drought. As the capabilities of land-surface models and remote sensing have improved, important physical processes such as dynamic, interactive vegetation phenology, groundwater, and snow pack evolution now support a range of drought indicators that better reflect coupled water, energy and carbon cycle processes.  In this work, we discuss these advances, including newer classes of indicators that can be applied to improve the characterization of drought onset, severity and duration.  We utilize a new model-based drought reconstruction to illustrate the role of dynamic phenology and groundwater in drought assessment.  Further, through case studies on flash droughts, snow droughts, and drought recovery, we illustrate the potential advantages of advanced model physics and observational capabilities, especially from remote sensing, in characterizing droughts."

This research project developed functionality for inferencing regolith mass ingested during RASSOR operation, enhancing RASSOR’s ability to successfully complete ISRU missions. Radio wave propagation time to the Moon and back is ~2.56 seconds. Though teleoperation is possible with this delay, autonomous capability that enables RASSOR to plan and execute excavation missions intelligently and efficiently is preferred. To teleoperate or run autonomously, it is crucial for the quantity of regolith mass ingested by RASSOR to be available as a system state for efficient operation (e.g. knowledge of whether drums are full informs the task of highest priority, whether it be continuing to dig, or returning to a processing plant to offload regolith). A configurable data reduction and analysis pipeline was created to allow for straightforward incorporation of new data, such as that from lunar excavation, to improve model performance in new environments. Four distinct modeling approaches were employed in developing a mass inferencing approach that could work on RASSOR. All four models take in system states and output a mass prediction for each set of the robot’s bucket drums. Initial results from deployment to RASSOR and testing in a simulated lunar environment show that the models have <10% mean error during robot operation. Future work includes refinement of a model that estimates regolith mass in real-time during excavation as well as further testing of the developed models on the hardware."

One of the drawbacks of chip polymer tantalum capacitors (CPTCs) is a relatively poor long-term stability at high temperatures. In this work, variations of capacitance, dissipation factor, and ESR in different types of capacitors including automotive grade parts from three manufacturers have been monitored during storage at temperatures from 100 ºC to 175 ºC for up to 18,000 hours. Results show that ESR is the most and capacitance the least sensitive to degradation parameter. Times to parametric failures have been simulated using a Weibull-Arrhenius model that allowed for assessments of activation energies of the degradation and prediction of times to failure at the use temperature. Degradation of CPTCs was explained by thermo-oxidative processes in conductive polymers that result in exponential increasing of the resistivity with time of ageing. This process starts after a certain incubation period that depends on packaging materials and design and corresponds to the time that is necessary to form delamination between the encapsulating molding compound and lead frame. The effectiveness of the existing qualification procedures to assure stable operation of CPTCs is discussed."

Systematic Error Sources in JWST NIRCam Time Series,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) holds great promise for characterizing atmospheres of transiting exoplanets, potentially providing insights into Earth-sized planets within the habitable zones of M-dwarf host stars if photon-limited performance can be achieved. Here, we discuss the systematic error sources that are expected to be present in grism time-series observations with the NIRCam instrument. We find that pointing jitter and high-gain antenna moves in addition to the detectors' subpixel crosshatch patterns will produce relatively small variations (less than 6 parts per million, ppm). The time-dependent aperture losses due to thermal instabilities in the optics can also be kept to below 2 ppm. To achieve these low noise values, it is important to employ a sufficiently large (more than 1farcs1) extraction aperture. Persistence due to charge-trapping will have a minor (less than 3 ppm) effect on the time series 20 minutes into an exposure and is expected to play a much smaller role than it does for the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 detectors. We expect detector temperature fluctuations to contribute less than 3 ppm. In total, our estimated noise floor from known systematic error sources is only 9 ppm per visit. We urge caution, however, because unknown systematic error sources could be present in flight and will only be measurable on astrophysical sources such as quiescent stars. We find that reciprocity failure may introduce a perennial instrument offset at the 40 ppm level, so corrections may be needed when a multi-instrument multi-observatory spectrum is stitched together over wide wavelength ranges."

The 3rd US National Climate Assessment pointed to a need for a system of indicators of climate and global change based on long-term data that could be used to support assessments and this led to the development of the National Climate Indicators System (NCIS). Here we identify a representative set of key atmospheric indicators of changes in atmospheric radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases (GHGs), and we evaluate atmospheric composition measurements, including non-CO2GHGs for use as climate change indicators in support of the US National Climate Assessment. GHG abundances and their changes over time can provide valuable information on the success of climate mitigation policies, as well as insights into possible carbon-climate feedback processes that may ultimately affect the success of those policies. To ensure that reliable information for assessing GHG emission changes can be provided on policy-relevant scales, expanded observational efforts are needed. Furthermore, the ability to detect trends resulting from changing emissions requires a commitment to supporting long-term observations. Long-term measurements of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and clouds and related climate indicators used with a dimming/brightening index could provide a foundation for quantifying forcing and its attribution and reducing error in existing indicators that do not account for complicated cloud processes."

Major  design  requirements  for  these arrays  will  be  low  mass,  compact  launch  stowage,  and  highly  reliable  deployment  and retraction. This paper presents a novel conceptual design for a10 kW solar array to address these  requirements referred  to  as  the Relocatable  Solar  Array  (RSA).Simply  stated,  the concept is a pair of solar cell blankets freely hanging from a horizontal cross arm supported by a vertical, slender, telescoping mast resting on a deployable tripod base. A major factor in simplifying the design is that the force exerted by lunar gravity is used to deploy and maintain extension of the hanging array blankets. A second major factor in achieving the desired low mass  and  high  volumetric  efficiency  is  that  the  array  operates  in  the vacuum,  low-gravity, lunar environment  with  no  deployed  vibration  frequency requirement. Such  a low-load environment  enables  use  of  extraordinarily  slender  and  low  mass  structural  members  to support the hanging array blankets. This concept was developed, in part, to serve as a NASA reference solar array concept against which other proposed arrays can be compared."

It is capable of moving among the geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere and hydrosphere. This flow of carbon is referred to as the Earth's carbon cycle. It is also intimately linked to the cycling of other elements and compounds. The ocean plays a fundamental role in Earth's carbon cycle, helping to regulate atmospheric CO2 concentration. The ocean biological carbon pump (OBCP), defined as a set of processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, is at the heart of the ocean carbon cycle. Monitoring the OBCP is critical to understanding how the Earth's carbon cycle is changing. At present, satellite remote sensing is the only tool available for viewing the entire surface ocean at high temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we review methods for monitoring the OBCP with a focus on satellites. We begin by providing an overview of the OBCP, defining and describing the pools of carbon in the ocean, and the processes controlling fluxes of carbon between the pools, from the surface to the deep ocean, and among ocean, land and atmosphere. We then examine how field measurements, from ship and autonomous platforms, complement satellite observations, provide validation points for satellite products and lead to a more complete view of the OBCP than would be possible from satellite observations alone. A thorough analysis is then provided on methods used for monitoring the OBCP from satellite platforms, covering current capabilities, concepts and gaps, and the requirement for uncertainties in satellite products. We finish by discussing the potential for producing a satellite-based carbon budget for the oceans, the advantages of integrating satellite-based observations with ecosystem models and field measurements, and future opportunities in space, all with a view towards bringing satellite observations into the limelight of ocean carbon research."

Year 1 was data integration, year 2 was predictive modeling, and then year 3(FY20), was the merging of those two prior year efforts into the final application, Crystal Ball (ssc.crystalball.insight.nasa.gov). Crystal Ball sits on the Insight platform (Insight is a NASA platform used to process, manage, integrate, analyze and visualize data at scale, insight.nasa.gov).   InFY20, the project focus concentrated on the larger vision of Prediction of Safety Incidents using Crystal Ball as the data source.  The Insight platform developer incorporated the predictive modeled data sets, and included a graphical user interface, resulting in a Dashboard for the Crystal Ball application;    This application is a one-stop-shop for SMA employees working across data sets and provides a snapshot of current relative risk in different types of locations across the center.  The ultimate goal is to have a tool that management can use to aid in decisions that are based on data already being collected. Ideally, the tool would highlight areas of increased risk for any given day. SMA will be conducting case studies to further refine the process of identifying higher areas of risk and potentially strategically direct resources where needed more.

Many valve manufacturing issues such as flow   passage   machining,   deep   hole   boring,   and   bi-metallic   joining   could   successfully   be addressed   with   this   new   technology.   The   goal   of   this   project   was   to   apply   additive manufacturing technology specifically to the problems that fluid control valves present. In order to properly apply additive manufacturing processes to the design of control valves, the plan was to manufacture samples using metals compatible with low temperature, high pressure oxygen service and then tested.  While vetting this project with manufacturers, it was determined that the materials chosen were not ideal for additive manufacturing due to their high reflectivity. Therefore, materials for this project were currently undergoing reevaluation and materials that are better suited for additive manufacturing may be substituted. During FY20, additional alloys were selected that would be both appropriate for high pressure oxygen environments as well appropriate for additive manufacturing processes.  However, final bid for manufacturing was six times   larger   than   the   available   funding   for   this   project.     Based   on   previous   additive manufacturing projects, the scope and funding for this project were appropriate, but a suitable manufacturer willing to provide a reasonable proposal, was not found. Therefore, funds were de-obligated for this project, and then re-obligated to augment another FY20 CIF project."

Since its inception, the MSSF has supported numerous studies and has since collected an extensive library of relevant and pertinent literature. The goal of our research was to develop and implement a sustainable, user-friendly literature database to better house this literature at the MSSF. To achieve this, our team focused on sorting, optimizing, and analyzing preexisting literature libraries to determine a best suitable and sustainable platform for the MSSF. After establishing initial database platforms, the team worked to develop descriptive and structural metadata categories to best sort the literature, which was followed by rigorous testing and optimization of the database as it was implemented. The MSSF has now been outfitted with a reliable, accessible database that effectively houses literature and provides diverse analysis to the user.

During the times leading up to their rapid intensifications (RI), two-dimensional inner-core structures are examined to analyze the strength and location of the developing convection. Moderate vertical wind shear in the environments of Harvey and Michael induced a pronounced convective asymmetry prior to RI, followed by a rapid axisymmetrization that occurred essentially in conjunction with RI. The evolutions of the tropical cyclones’ (TCs’) coldest Tb’s indicate that the inner-core convective activity began to increase in the 12 h prior to RI onset, primarily in 2–4-h substantial “bursts”, while substantial convection dominated essentially the entirety of the region within 100 km of the surface center within 12 h of the onset of intensification. Azimuthally averaged Tb evolutions illustrate the development of each TCs’ eye and eyewall, the variability of the radial extent of the central dense overcast associated with the diurnal cycle, as well as details of the evolving convective structures throughout intensification. Hövmoller diagrams of data at constant radii reveal areas of cold Tb’s propagating around the TCs on timescales of 2–3-h. The examination of these features in a deep-layer shear-relative sense reveals that they initiate primarily downshear of the TCs’ surface centers. As RI is reached, these areas of convection are able to propagate into the upshear quadrants, which helps facilitate the onset of more substantial intensification."

The method of extracting skin friction from surface pressure is described, including the fundamental relation between skin friction and surface pressure, the variational method, error analysis, and an approximate iterative method. The proposed method is based on a coupling relation between skin friction and surface pressure, where the boundary enstrophy flux is suitably modeled or approximated. This method is applied to unsteady PSP data obtained in incident SWBLIs at Mach 2.5 for different Reynolds numbers, revealing the skin-friction structures of the flows: particularly, the separation bubble induced by the incident shock wave.

The flag is based on precipitation estimates from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Forward Processing numerical weather prediction system. An error in flagging during an active or recent precipitation event can produce either 1) an overestimation of soil moisture due to short-term surface wetting of vegetation and/or surface ponding (if soil moisture retrieval was attempted in the presence of rain) or 2) an unnecessary nonretrieval of soil moisture and loss of data (if retrieval is flagged due to an erroneous indication of rain). Satellite precipitation estimates from the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), version 06, Early Run (latency of ~4 h) precipitationCal product are used here to evaluate the GEOS-based precipitation flag in the L2SMP product for both the 1800 local time (LT) ascending and 0600 LT descending SMAP overpasses over the first five years of the mission (2015–20). Consisting of blended precipitation measurements from the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) satellite constellation, IMERG is treated as the “truth” when comparing to the GEOS model forecasts of precipitation used by SMAP. Key results include (i) IMERG measurements generally show higher spatial variability than the GEOS forecast precipitation, (ii) the IMERG product has a higher frequency of light precipitation amounts, and (iii) the effect of incorporating IMERG rainfall measurements in lieu of GEOS precipitation forecasts are minimal on the L2SMP retrieval accuracy (determined vs in situ soil moisture measurements at core validation sites). Our results indicate that L2SMP retrievals continue to meet the mission’s accuracy requirement [standard deviation of the unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) less than 0.04 cu. m/cu. m]."

Our follow-up observations started <10 days after the source began to brighten in the optical and lasted for a period of six months. Our late-time host-dominated spectrum indicates that the host galaxy likely harbors a weak active galactic nucleus. The initial Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectrum of AT 2019qiz exhibits an iron and low-ionization broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) system that is seen for the first time in a TDE. This spectrum also bears a striking resemblance to that of Gaia16apd, a superluminous supernova. Our observations provide insights into the outflow properties in TDEs and show evidence for a connection between TDEs and engine-powered supernovae at early phases, as originally suggested by Metzger & Stone (2016). In a time frame of 50 days, the UV spectra of AT 2019qiz started to resemble those of previous TDEs with only high-ionization BALs. The change in UV spectral signatures is accompanied by a decrease in the outflow velocity, which began at 15,000 km/s and decelerated to ~ 10,000 km/s. A similar evolution in the Ha emission-line width further supports the speculation that the broad Balmer emission lines are formed in TDE outflows. In addition, we detect narrow absorption features on top of the FeLoBAL signatures in the early HST UV spectrum of AT 2019qiz. The measured H I column density corresponds to a Lyman-limit system, whereas the metal absorption lines (such as N V, C IV, Fe II, and Mg II) are likely probing the circumnuclear gas and interstellar medium in the host galaxy."

The Study was organized into three primary areas of investigation: Defining the Market appetite for high speed air transport, Defining the business cases; and Assessing Barriers in the environment. The market demand was assessed across a range of Mach numbers from Mach 2 to Mach 6 and ticket price elasticity was determined by surveying potential customers, literature reviews and stakeholder and expert interviews for passenger aircraft, private aircraft and cargo markets. The business case analyses assessed potential business cases across a three-dimensional trade space: flight speed (Mach 2-6), passenger capacity (20-200 passengers) and design range (2500-7500 nmi.). By using the SpaceWorks Rosetta model, we were able to assess each combination in the trade space and to determine the steady state Internal Rate of Return (IRR or profit) was our primary figure of merit and allowed us to rank order the business cases to understand the trends and draw conclusions from the complex trade space. Lastly, we assessed other potential barriers to high speed flight. These were determined through literature review and stakeholder/expert interviews.

The Cameron Peak Fire (largest in Colorado recorded history) and the CalWood Fire collectively burned an estimated 219,019 acres from August through December of 2020. Project partners at the Coalition for the Poudre River Watershed, Colorado State Forest Service, Ben Delatour Scout Ranch, The Nature Conservancy, Colorado Forest Restoration Institute, and Colorado State University were interested in understanding the effectiveness of previous forest treatments in reducing burn severity within the Cameron Peak Fire and the CalWood Fire. We first collated a forest treatment dataset from pre-existing datasets by reclassifying over 29,000 treatments, which occurred across the Northern Colorado Front Range between 1970-2020. Secondly, we mapped three burn severity indices using Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI Earth observations and compared them to soil burn severity field data. Thirdly, a total of 35 topographic, disturbance, forest structure, and treatment predictor variables were generated across the fires. Finally, we assessed relationships between these predictor variables and burn severity using the random forest algorithm. Model results indicate that the primary drivers of burn severity were elevation and distance to treatment edge for the Cameron Peak Fire and fire area and forest canopy cover for the CalWood Fire. Further analysis of these variables paired with field data is necessary to understand the relationship between burn severity and treatments to guide future restoration efforts, improve forest resiliency, and mitigate fire risks."

The VIIRS reflective solar bands (RSBs) are calibrated on-orbit primarily by an onboard solar diffuser (SD). The SD on-orbit degradation is tracked by an onboard SD stability monitor(SDSM). The VIIRS RSBs view the SD through a rotating telescope assembly (RTA). The RTA views the SD from a direction that is quite different from that of the SDSM. It has been shown that the SD degrades non-uniformly with respect to the incident and outgoing directions, especially at the short wavelengths. Thus, the SDSM calibration cannot provide an accurate SD degradation estimation for the view direction of the RTA, resulting in long-term drifts in the calibration coefficients derived from the SD and SDSM calibration. S-NPP VIIRS has been scheduled to view the Moon approximately monthly since its launch. The lunar observations can provide accurate long-term trends for the RSB calibration coefficients since the lunar surface reflectance is quite stable. By comparing the SD and lunar calibration results, we can obtain the SD degradation differences at the view directions of the SDSM and RTA and derive the SD degradation at the view direction of the RTA. Moreover, we can also derive the SD degradation in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral range, wherein the SDSM cannot track the SD degradation. In this paper, we will derive the SD degradation for the view direction of the RTA from the SD, SDSM, and lunar calibrations from the visible to SWIR spectral range. We will also simulate the SD degradation with analytical models and compare their performances."

Results show propeller and possibly motor tones are important for the overall noise levels.  The vehicle has four support arms each with a pair of contra-rotating propellers. Noise measurements show higher noise levels from the lower propellers, likely due to inflow distortion from the arms and top propellers. Possible motor noise was identified by calculating harmonics of the line frequency and comparing to the tones in the narrowband acoustic spectra and phased microphone array data. The acoustic far field was found to be about 100 ft away from the vehicle, but additional microphones are needed to provide a better assessment.

Systems that assimilate satellite observations, given their short latency and dense spatial coverage, into high resolution global models are valuable, if not essential, tools for addressing this need. A notable drawback of modern assimilation systems is the long latency of many vital in-put datasets, e.g., inventories, in situ measurements, and re-processed remote-sensing data can trail the current date by months to years. This paper describes techniques for bias-correcting surface fluxes derived from satellite observations of the Earth’s surface to be consistent with constraints from inventories and in situ CO2 datasets. The techniques are applicable in both short-term forecasts and retrospective simulations, thus taking advantage of the coverage and short latency of satellite data while reproducing the major features of long-term inventory and in situ records. Our approach begins with a standard collection of diagnostic fluxes which incorporate a variety of remote-sensing driver data, viz. vegetation indices, fire radiative power, and nighttime lights. We then apply an empirical sink so that global budgets of the diagnostic fluxes match given atmospheric and oceanic growth rates for each year. This step removes coherent, systematic flux errors that produce biases inCO2which mask the signals an assimilation system hopes to capture. Depending on the simulation mode, the empirical sink uses different choices of atmospheric growth rates: estimates based on observations in retrospective mode and projections based on seasonal fore-casts of sea surface temperature in forecasting mode. The retrospective fluxes, when used in simulations with NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS), reproduce marine boundary layer measurements with comparable skill to those using fluxes from a modern inversion system. The forecasted fluxes show promising accuracy in their application to the analysis of changes in the carbon cycle as they occur."

The recent SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP satellites have demonstrated the value of measurements at 1400 MHz for observing surface soil moisture, sea surface salinity, sea ice thickness, soil freeze/thaw state, and other geophysical variables. However, the information obtained is limited by penetration through the subsurface at 1400 MHz and by a reduced sensitivity to surface salinity in cold or wind-roughened waters. Recent airborne experiments have shown the potential of brightness temperature measurements from 500–1400 MHz to address these limitations by enabling sensing of soil moisture and sea ice thickness to greater depths, sensing of temperature deep within ice sheets, improved sensing of sea salinity in cold waters, and enhanced sensitivity to soil moisture under vegetation canopies. However, the absence of significant spectrum reserved for passive microwave measurements in the 500–1400 MHz band requires both an opportunistic sensing strategy and systems for reducing the impact of radio-frequency interference. Here, we summarize the potential advantages and applications of 500–1400 MHz microwave radiometry for Earth observation and review recent experiments and demonstrations of these concepts. We also describe the remaining questions and challenges to be addressed in advancing to future spaceborne operation of this technology along with recommendations for future research activities."

However, basal melt has not been included explicitly in assessments of ice-sheet mass loss so far. Here, we present the first estimate of the total and regional basal melt produced by the ice sheet and the recent change in basal melt through time. We find that the ice sheet’s present basal melt production is 21.4 +4.4/−4.0 Gt per year, and that melt generated by basal friction is responsible for about half of this volume. We estimate that basal melting has increased by 2.9 ± 5.2 Gt during the first decade of the 2000s. As the Arctic warms, we anticipate that basal melt will continue to increase due to faster ice flow and more surface melting thus compounding current mass loss trends, enhancing solid ice discharge, and modifying fjord circulation."

SO2 decreases began in the 1970s in the US and Europe and are expected to continue into the future, while recent emissions decreases in China are also projected to continue. In addition to the well-documented climate effects (warming) from reducing aerosols, tropospheric oxidation is impacted via aerosol modification of photolysis rates and radical sinks. Impacts on the hydroxyl radical and other trace constituents directly affect climate and air quality metrics such as surface ozone levels. We use the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model version 3 nudged towards National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis wind velocities to estimate the impact of SO2 emissions from the US, Europe, and China by differencing a control simulation with an otherwise identical simulation in which 2015 anthropogenic SO2 emissions are set to zero over one of the regions. Springtime sulfate aerosol changes occur both locally to the emission region and also throughout the Northern Hemispheric troposphere, including remote oceanic regions and the Arctic. Hydroperoxy (HO2) radicals are directly removed via heterogeneous chemistry on aerosol surfaces, including sulfate, in the model, and we find that sulfate aerosol produced by SO2 emissions from the three individual northern mid-latitude regions strongly reduces both HO2 and hydroxyl (OH) by up to 10 % year-round throughout most of the troposphere north of 30∘ N latitude. Regional SO2 emissions significantly increase nitrogen oxides (NOx) by about 5 %–8 % throughout most of the free troposphere in the Northern Hemisphere by increasing the NOx lifetime as the heterogeneous sink of HO2 on sulfate aerosol declines. Despite the NOx increases, tropospheric ozone decreases at northern mid-latitudes by 1 %–4 % zonally averaged and by up to 5 ppbv in summertime surface air over China, where the decreases in HO2 and OH suppress O3 production. Since 2015 anthropogenic SO2 emissions in China exceed those in the US or Europe, the oxidative response is greatest for the China perturbation simulation. Chemical effects of aerosols on oxidation (reactive uptake) dominate over radiative effects (photolysis rates), the latter of which are only statistically significant locally for the large perturbation over China. We find that the SO2 emissions decrease in China, which has yet to be fully realized, will have the largest impact on oxidants and related species in the Northern Hemisphere free troposphere compared to future decreases in Europe or the US. Our results bolster previous calls for a multipollutant strategy for air pollution mitigation to avoid the unintended consequence of aerosol removal leading to surface ozone increases that offset or mask surface ozone gains achieved by regulation of other pollutants, especially in countries where current usage of high-sulfur emitting fuels may be phased out in the future."

The number of days with
observed surface ozone levels exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with a maximum during summer, when models suggest a minimum influence of stratospheric intrusions and the largest impact from Los Angeles Basin pollution transport. Additionally, measured and modeled surface ozone and PM10 were analyzed as a function of season, time of the day, and wind direction. Measurements and models are in good qualitative agreement, with maximum surface ozone observed for southwest and west winds. For the prevailing summer wind direction, slightly south of the ozone maximum and corresponding to south-southwest winds, lower ozone levels were observed. Back trajectories suggest that this is associated with transport from the central Los Angeles Basin, where titration limits the amount of surface ozone. A quantitative comparison of the lidar profiles with WRF-Chem and WACCM models revealed good agreement near the surface, with models showing an increasing positive bias as function of altitude, reaching 75 % at 15 km above sea level. Finally, three selected case studies covering the different mechanisms affecting the near-surface ozone concentration over the San Gabriel Mountains, namely stratospheric intrusions and pollution transport, are analyzed based on surface and ozone lidar measurements, as well as co-located ceilometer measurements and models."

Here we report that accounting for precipitation in the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE3 radiation scheme, neglected in more than 60% of CMIP6 and 90% of CMIP5 models, systematically changes its apparent CPP and substantially increases its cloud feedback, consistent with results using CMIP models. Including precipitation in the comparison with Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) measurements and in model radiation schemes is essential to faithfully constrain cloud amount and phase partitioning, and simulate cloud feedbacks. Our findings suggest that making radiation schemes precipitation-aware (missing in most CMIP6 models) should strengthen their positive cloud feedback and further increase their already high mean climate sensitivity."

We study air traffic management (ATM) for vehicles in a UAM fleet, while guaranteeing system safety requirements such as traffic separation. Existing ATM methods for unmanned aerial systems, such as UAS traffic management, utilize alternative approaches which do not provide strict safety guarantees. No established infrastructure exists for providing ATM at scale for UAM. We provide a decentralized, hierarchical approach for UAM ATM that allows for scalability to high traffic densities as well as providing theoretical guarantees of correctness with respect to user-provided safety specifications. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a novel UAM ATM architecture that divides the control authority between vertihubs that are each in charge of all UAM vehicles in their local airspace. Each vertihub also contains a number of vertiports that are in charge of UAM vehicle takeoffs and landings. The resulting architecture is decentralized and hierarchical, which not only enables scalability, but also robustness in the event of any individual vertihub or vertiport no longer being operational. Second, we provide a contract-based correct-by-construction reactive synthesis approach that provably guarantees safety properties with respect to user-provided specifications in linear temporal logic. We demonstrate the approach on large-volume UAM air traffic data."

This provides a unique opportunity to study the formation and evolution of the accretion flow around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We present two years of multi-wavelength monitoring observations of the TDE AT2018fyk at X-ray, UV, optical and radio wavelengths. We identify three distinct accretion states and two state transitions between them. These appear remarkably similar to the behaviour of stellar-mass black holes in outburst. The X-ray spectral properties show a transition from a soft (thermal-dominated) to a hard (power-law dominated) spectral state around Lbol ~few x 10^(-2) LEdd, and the strengthening of the corona over time ~100-200 days after the UV/optical peak. Contemporaneously, the spectral energy distribution (in particular, the UV-to-X-ray spectral slope alphaox ) shows a pronounced softening as the outburst progresses. The X-ray timing properties also show a marked change, initially dominated by variability at long (>day) timescales while a high frequency (~10-3 Hz) component emerges after the transition into the hard state. At late times (~500 days after peak), a second accretion state transition occurs, from the hard into the quiescent state, as identified by the sudden collapse of the bolometric (X-ray+UV) emission to levels below 10-3.4 LEdd. Our findings illustrate that TDEs can be used to study the scale (in)variance of accretion processes in individual SMBHs. Consequently, they provide a new avenue to study accretion states over seven orders of magnitude in black hole mass, removing limitations inherent to commonly used ensemble studies."

Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) architecture and protocols provide a standard network layer among these varying scenarios and mitigate many challenges of the space environment, such as long delays, unplanned service interruptions, and asymmetric links. The Cognitive Space Gateway (CSG) is a routing method in a DTN architecture that uses spiking neural networks as the learning element to optimize routing decisions in a complex environment.

This work aims to further develop cognitive networking technologies in several critical areas, including DTN, the CSG algorithm, CubeSat swarm topologies, and cloud services. To test the algorithm in a realistic scenario, the emulated network topology is based on a CubeSat swarm. The swarm may function as a mesh of nodes or as a hub-and-spoke network.  An emulation environment will be built upon a commercial cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud. The cloud environment may enable a flexible, lower maintenance approach versus a multi-hop network based in a physical laboratory. The cloud platform will provide a secure environment allowing for collaboration among government and academic entities."

Higher CO2 increases leaf area (LAI), thereby increasing transpiration and water losses. Simultaneously, elevated CO2 reduces stomatal conductance and transpiration, thereby increasing rootzone soil moisture. Which mechanism dominates in the future is highly uncertain, partly because these two processes are difficult to explicitly separate within dynamic vegetation models. We address this challenge by using the GISS ModelE global climate model to conduct a novel set of idealized 2×CO2 sensitivity experiments to: evaluate the total vegetation biophysical contribution to regional climate change under high CO2; and quantify the separate contributions of enhanced LAI and reduced stomatal conductance to regional hydroclimate responses. We find that increased LAI exacerbates soil moisture deficits across the sub‐tropics and more water‐limited regions, but also attenuates warming by ∼0.5–1°C in the US Southwest, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and northern South America. Reduced stomatal conductance effects contribute ∼1°C of summertime warming. For some regions, enhanced LAI and reduced stomatal conductance produce nonlinear and either competing or mutually amplifying hydroclimate responses. In northeastern Australia, these effects combine to exacerbate radiation‐forced warming and contribute to year‐round water limitation. Conversely, at higher latitudes these combined effects result in less warming than would otherwise be predicted due to nonlinear responses. These results highlight substantial regional variation in CO2‐driven vegetation responses and the importance of improving model representations of these processes to better quantify regional hydroclimate impacts."

EBCs are susceptible to several failure modes including oxidation/delamination, recession, chemical attack and dissolution, thermomechanical degradation, erosion, and foreign object impact damage in a combustion environment.  Spallation of environmental barrier coating (EBC), induced by a thermally grown oxide (TGO) layer, is a key EBC failure mode.  The TGO layer, resulting from steam oxidation, grows either from a silicon bond coat layer (if present) or from a silicon carbide (SiC) based substrate itself.  The TGO layer evolves (i.e., thickness increases with time) as water vapor and oxygen gradually diffuse through the EBC, and the EBC spalls off once the TGO layer reaches some critical thickness.  The critical thickness of the TGO layer for failure is in the range of 20-30 microns, with the actual value depending upon exposure temperature, microstructure, etc. Current work at NASA Glenn Research Center, under the Transformative Tools and Technology (TTT) subproject is aimed at addressing associated failure modes in EBC systems and developing robust analysis tools to aid in the design/analysis of these systems.  The objective of the current work is to conduct a sensitivity study to examine the influence of uniformly and non-uniformly grown oxide layers on the associated driving forces leading to spallation of the EBC when subjected to isothermal loading.  The effect of damage in the TGO layer on the resulting stress states is also assessed both in uniform and non-uniform TGO layers."

Here, we combine remotely sensed data on fire, local climatic conditions, and vegetation with spatial data on violence, territorial control, and return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to explore the underlying causes of Syria's fires at the sub-district, or ADM-3, level. We find evidence for a nuanced story: precipitation and stabilization in Kurdish-controlled territory fueled a bountiful wheat-growing year in 2019. This agricultural resurgence coincided with high fire activity, possibly revealing that people were attempting to jump-start agricultural livelihoods that were lost during the civil war. Restoration of labor forces from IDP returns was not a significant factor in this agricultural recovery. Meanwhile, most sub-districts outside Kurdish-controlled territory were free of fires, which explains the absence of a relationship between vegetation and fire. Thus, Syrian fire patterns in 2019 may be a signal of uneven stabilization, rather than destabilization."

  * Use of AI to identify new, or previously unidentified, science topics for prioritization.

  * Using AI to better label and increase discoverability of scientific literature and proposals.

  * Use of AI to enhance current observation capabilities for scientific missions.

  * Using AI to mitigate biases in selection of proposal reviewers and membership   of advisory committees.

Large flood events are predicted to increase in frequency and severity, posing risks to communities in this region, particularly Tribal Nations. We used data from Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-SAR), imagery from the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and digital elevation models (DEMs) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) within Google Earth Engine to map historical floods in the region beginning in 2014 with particular attention to the Rosebud Sioux Reservation and the tribal lands of other Great Plains Tribal Water Alliance members. This historical mapping used C-SAR for a combined method approach with a Z-score algorithm in addition to an index for flooded short vegetation. We also developed a flood risk map by weighting different flood predictor variables according to flood risk literature. These variables included soil drainage from the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO); elevation, slope, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) derived from digital elevation models; precipitation from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS); land cover from the National Land Cover Database (NLDC); and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI).

The method uses zenith radiances at the water vapor band at 720 nm and adjacent non-absorbing band at 750 nm.Radiative transfer calculations show that the relative difference in zenith radiance between the two bands depends on PWV and the variations in cloud optical depth introduce a small change in the relative difference which is independent of PWV amount. This allows us to retrieve PWV variations in the cloud-clear transition zone for clouds over dark ocean surface. We applied this method to a Cu cloud case with zenith radiance observations by the Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Zenith (SASZe) during the Marine ARM GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) field campaign. We found that there is about 10% change in PWV amount from known-cloudy region to known-clear sky in cloud edges.

These   satellite sensors use different techniques to characterize particle size and   shape   properties;   and   we   have   developed   sensor-specific  methods  (broadly  categorized  into  size-based  and shape-based  method)  to  derive dust  optical  depth  (DOD). The  size-based  DOD  from  MODIS  and  IASI  generally agrees better with AERONET-derived DOD than the shape-based  DOD  from  CALIOP  and  MISR  does. Overall,  the shape-based  DOD  is  smaller  than  the  size-based  DOD  by about 25%,  which  is  consistent  with  distinctive  ways  of accounting  for  coarse-spherical  particles of dust-pollution internal  mixture.  While  such  dust-pollution  mixtures  are counted as dust in the size-based DOD, they are excluded in the  shape-based  DOD. DOD  is  not  a  good  proxy  for  dust deposition. Instead, the dust deposition depends strongly on the gradient of DOD on a monthly basis and can be derived by  calculating  the  meridional  and  zonal  dust  mass  flux based on the three-dimensional distributions of dust. Among the   remote   sensing   measurements,   difference   in   dust deposition  is  smaller  than  that  of  DOD,  suggesting  that different  satellites  characterize  the  DOD  gradient  more consistently than DOD itself. Satellite measurements of dust deposition  and  DOD  also provide  an  accurate  estimate  of the dust loss frequency (LF) that measures how efficient the dust  is  removed  from  the  atmosphere.  We  found  that  these remote  sensing  measurements  yield  similar  LF  values of 0.078 –0.102  d-1,  which  however  is  factors  of  2-5  smaller than  model  simulations. This  analysis provides  valuable insights  into  potential  deficiencies  in  models’  emission  and transport/removal  processes  and  hence helps guide model improvement."

One of the drawbacks of chip polymer tantalum capacitors (CPTCs) is a relatively poor long-term stability at high temperatures. In this work, variations of capacitance, dissipation factor, and ESR in different types of capacitors including automotive grade parts from three manufacturers have been monitored during storage at temperatures from 100 ºC to 175 ºC for up to 18,000 hours. Results show that ESR is the most and capacitance the least sensitive parameter to degradation. Times to parametric failures have been simulated using a Weibull-Arrhenius model that allowed for assessments of activation energies of the degradation and prediction of times to failure at the use temperature. Degradation of CPTCs was explained by thermo-oxidative processes in conductive polymers that result in exponential increase of the resistivity with time of aging. This process starts after a certain incubation period that depends on packaging materials and design and corresponds to the time that is necessary to form delamination between the encapsulating molding compound and lead frame. The effectiveness of the existing qualification procedures to assure stable operation of CPTCs is discussed."

Correlations among optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission in GRBs have been explored, to attempt to answer whether the earliest optical emission comes from internal and/or external shocks. We present optical photometric observations of GRB 180325A collected with the TAROT and RATIR ground-based telescopes. These observations show two strong optical flashes with separate peaks at ∼50 and ∼120 s, followed by a temporally extended optical emission. We also present X-rays and gamma-ray observations of GRB 180325A, detected by the Burst Alert Telescope and X-ray Telescope, on the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory, which both observed a narrow flash at ∼80 s. We show that the prompt gamma-ray and X-ray early emission shares similar temporal and spectral features consistent with internal dissipation within the relativistic outflow (e.g., by internal shocks or magnetic reconnection), while the early optical flashes are likely generated by the reverse shock that decelerates the ejecta as it sweeps up the external medium."

The CSH algorithm requires the use of a cloud-resolving model (CRM) to simulate LH profiles to build look-up tables (LUTs).  In this paper we describe the current V6 CSH and its differences/similarities versus the previous V5 CSH.  Long-term CRM simulations are conducted to identify the impact of CRM resolution and the convective-stratiform separation method on LH structure/profiles.  The TRMM and GPM Combined algorithm derived surface rainfall rates and their associated precipitation properties are the input to the CSH algorithm.

Since there is no direct measurement of LH structure, the performance of the CSH V6 algorithm is examined by comparing its vertically-integrated heating (or equivalent surface rainfall rate) against the surface rainfall rate derived from the TRMM/GPM Combined algorithm.  The results suggest the CSH three-month and zonal mean equivalent surface rain rates are in good agreement with the Combined rates over the ITCZ region; the agreement is best over ocean.  CSH three-month and zonal mean equivalent surface rain rates are larger than the Combined rates over land in both the tropics and sub-tropics.  CSH three-month mean equivalent surface rainfall rates also have local differences with the Combined rates that can be smoothed by area averaging to larger horizontal resolutions (from the CSH standard grid of 0.25o x 0.25o to 0.5o x 0.5o or 1.0o x 1.0o).  CSH equivalent surface rainfall rates have more light rain rates but less larger rain rates compared to the GPM Combined surface rain rates."

The health of this freshwater system is under pressure from accelerating dam construction, intensifying agriculture, deforestation, and changing climate patterns, forcing tradeoffs between immediate food security and the long-term vitality and productivity of the ecosystem. Efficient freshwater system monitoring is crucial to navigating these challenges. In collaboration with Conservation International, the Cambodian Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, and the Tonlé Sap Authority, we developed and tested remotely-sensed proxies for sub-indicators of the Freshwater Health Index (FHI), which is typically calculated using in situ datasets. We used landcover datasets derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), PROBA-V Vegetation sensor (VGT), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI), Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and Envisat Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) as inputs to calculate land cover naturalness and bank modification. Additionally, we created a lake-level time series using a collection of altimetry data sources to estimate deviation from natural flow. We observed a decrease in landcover naturalness and a breakdown in the volume and regularity of annual lake levels from 2000-2020, reflecting increased pressure on water supply and agricultural productivity. At least 8% of forested areas in the basin were lost and rice harvest intensity increased over the course of the study period. These results will help our partners make informed decisions regarding freshwater management. Furthermore, our remotely-sensed FHI analysis can be replicated in other regions, providing decision makers with a snapshot of freshwater health in data-scarce environments."

Here we use the Old World Drought Atlas (OWDA), a tree-ring based reconstruction of the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI), to examine this wetting trend and place it in a longer hydroclimatic context. We find that scPDSI variability in northwestern Europe is strongly correlated with the leading mode of the OWDA during the last millennium (1000–2012). This leading mode, here named the ‘English Channel’ (EC) mode, has pronounced variability on interannual to centennial timescales and has an expression in scPDSI similar to that of the East Atlantic teleconnection pattern. A shift in the EC mode from a prolonged negative phase to more neutral conditions during the 19th and 20th centuries is associated with the wetting trend over its area of influence in England, Wales, and much of northern continental Europe. The EC mode is the dominant scPDSI mode from approximately 1000–1850, after which its dominance waned in favor of the secondary ‘North–South’ (NS) mode, which has an expression in scPDSI similar to that of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). We examine the dynamical nature of both of these modes and how they vary on interannual to centennial timescales. Our results provide insight into the nature of hydroclimate variability in Europe before the widespread availability of instrumental observations."

The Study was organized into three primary areas of investigation: Defining the Market appetite for high speed air transport, Defining the business cases; and Assessing Barriers in the environment. The market demand was assessed across a range of Mach numbers from Mach 2 to Mach 6 and ticket price elasticity was determined by surveying potential customers, literature reviews and stakeholder and expert interviews for passenger aircraft, private aircraft and cargo markets. The business case analyses assessed potential business cases across a three-dimensional trade space: flight speed (Mach 2-6), passenger capacity (20-200 passengers) and design range (2500-7500 nmi.). By using the SpaceWorks Rosetta model, we were able to assess each combination in the trade space and to determine the steady state Internal Rate of Return (IRR or profit) was our primary figure of merit and allowed us to rank order the business cases to understand the trends and draw conclusions from the complex trade space. Lastly, we assessed other potential barriers to high speed flight. These were determined through literature review and stakeholder/expert interviews. Once these were compiled, we developed an objective scoring system to allow us to determine overall significance and challenge to aspiring market entrants.  The majority of the research was conducted between July and December of 2020 and the results compiled and communicated to NASA in the first quarter of calendar year 2021. This report, along with the companion briefing deck, document the summation of our research and serve as a data repository for use by future researchers in government and industry."

Eleven sublimated photoproducts were uniquely identified: carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (H2CO), ketene (C2H2O), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), ethylene oxide (CH2OCH2), vinyl alcohol (CH2CHOH), ethanol (CH3CH2OH), dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), methyl formate (HCOOCH3), glycolaldehyde (HOCH2CHO), and acetone ((CH3)2CO). Two additional products were detected in the photolyzed ice by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy: carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). The rotational temperatures and gas densities were calculated for the organics containing two or more C atoms via a rotation diagram analysis, and the gas-phase submillimeter/far-IR technique was used in tandem with mass spectrometry and FTIR spectroscopy of the ice during photolysis. The abundance ratios of the sublimated species (normalized to methanol) were compared to those observed in hot cores (Orion-KL, Sagittarius B2(N), and IRAS 16293-2422(B)) and in comets C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) and 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko."

This finding is based on analysis of near-continuous 41-year satellite microwave radiometer and scatterometer data, which are sensitive to meltwater on the ice shelf surface and in the near-surface snow. Using optical satellite imagery from Landsat 8 (2013 to 2020) and Sentinel-2 (2017 to 2020), record volumes of surface meltwater ponding were also observed on the northern GVIIS in 2019/2020, with 23 % of the surface area covered by 0.62 km3 of ponded meltwater on 19 January. These exceptional melt and surface ponding conditions in 2019/2020 were driven by sustained air temperatures ≥0 ∘C for anomalously long periods (55 to 90 h) from late November onwards, which limited meltwater refreezing. The sustained warm periods were likely driven by warm, low-speed (≤7.5 m s−1) northwesterly and northeasterly winds and not by foehn wind conditions, which were only present for 9 h total in the 2019/2020 melt season. Increased surface ponding on ice shelves may threaten their stability through increased potential for hydrofracture initiation; a risk that may increase due to firn air content depletion in response to near-surface melting."

The retrievals are illustrated on examples of the wildfire smoke events over North America, and dust storms over greater Sahara region in 2018. An initial evaluation of single scattering albedo (SSA) at 443 nm over these regions shows a good agreement with AERONET data, generally within the uncertainty of AERONET SSA of ± 0.03. A particularly good agreement is achieved for dust with R∼0.62, rmse∼0.02, negligible bias, and 85% points within the expected error. This new capability is part of version 2 MAIAC EPIC algorithm. The v2

How REM impacts cirrus clouds is investigated in this study, using bin microphysical model simulations and coincident data of the CloudSat and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellites. REM affects ice crystal spectrum with two types: radiative cooling and warming. Radiative cooling, as predicted by the bin-model simulations, favors the formation of horizontally oriented ice crystals (HOICs), but radiative warming does not. Hence, a test of REM can be transformed to a test of HOICs, because HOICs can be measured by the microwave polarization observations of the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) at 166 GHz. To analyze the GMI data for their HOIC distribution, clouds are sorted into four groups with different optical depth and altitude, based on the radiative cooling/warming ratio (or eta) computed with satellite-retrieved ice water content. Their HOIC distributions (e.g., the midlevel thick clouds have more HOICs than the high-level ones) agree well with those predicted by the bin-model simulations. The general agreement between the GMI observations and bin-model simulations suggests that REM is common in cirrus clouds and impacts cirrus clouds significantly."

With the goal of evaluating the available engineering models for predicting the effects of step excrescences on the transition characteristics, two separate methodologies are used to monitor the streamwise shift in the transition onset location as the step height and the flow speed are varied across the range of a previously reported experiment involving step-height-to-local-displacement-thickness ratios of 0 < <i>h/δ*</i> < 1.6. Unlike the variable <i>N</i>-factor method from the previous literature, both of these methods are general in scope and do not involve any empirical correlations that are specific to step excrescences. The first of these techniques involves an <i>N</i>-factor method that directly accounts for the change in boundary-layer instability characteristics due to the step. Stability computations using the harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE), which fully account for the nonparallel-mean-flow effects close to the BFS, indicate that the measured transition locations at nearly all test conditions (<i>h/δ*</i> < 1.3) correlate well with a computed <i>N</i>-factor of <i>N<sub>tr</sub></i> = 7.6, demonstrating a successful stability-based transition criterion related to step excrescences. Linear stability theory, which does not account for nonparallel effects, demonstrates reasonable agreement with the HLNSE results, yielding good predictions for the overall trends, but predicts a somewhat earlier onset of transition than HLNSE. The other methodology used in this work involves transport-equation-based transition models. We first show that the Langtry-Menter <i>y - Re<sub>θt</sub></i> transition model cannot accurately predict the location of transition onset for moderate BFS heights because it is unable to accurately account for the flow history effects. Along with the Langtry-Menter transition model, we also show the amplification factor transport model does not produce accurate transition locations for subsonic flow over steps even though it accounts for some flow history effects."

This assessment was conducted following the installation of the new DRWP systems at the Western and Eastern Ranges. DRWP profiles were compared to Automated Meteorological Profiling System balloons launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base. Balloon data was collected from both normal synoptic and launch operations as well as some releases at the DRWP site. These results will include errors due to the spatial separation of winds. Root Mean Square wind speed deltas between the balloons and DRWP system mainly ranged between 1.0 and 2.3 m/s. Mean wind direction deltas mainly ranged between 10 and 28 degrees for wind speeds greater than or equal to 4 m/s. Data availability at discrete altitudes ranged from 20% to 94% with the least amount of available profiles being in the lower altitude ranges between 100 m and 500 m. The effective vertical resolution was determined to be approximately 250 m. The results from this analysis were requested by the United States Space Force for use of the acceptance of the DRWP system and for internal EV44 reference.

In this review, we investigate how continuous, automated observations of the atmospheric boundary layer can enhance the scientific value of co-located eddy covariance measurements of land-atmosphere fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, as are being made at FLUXNET sites worldwide. We highlight four key opportunities to integrate tower-based flux measurements with continuous, long-term atmospheric boundary layer measurements: (1) to interpret surface flux and atmospheric boundary layer exchange dynamics and feedbacks at flux tower sites, (2) to support flux footprint modelling, the interpretation of surface fluxes in heterogeneous and mountainous terrain, and quality control of eddy covariance flux measurements, (3) to support regional-scale modeling and upscaling of surface fluxes to continental scales, and (4) to quantify land-atmosphere coupling and validate its representation in Earth system models. Adding a suite of atmospheric boundary layer measurements to eddy covariance flux tower sites, and supporting the sharing of these data to tower networks, would allow the Earth science community to address new emerging research questions, better interpret ongoing flux tower measurements, and would present novel opportunities for collaborations between FLUXNET scientists and atmospheric and remote sensing scientists."

Based on the work of Mauche et al., we conjectured that the strong UV field of ζ Puppis produces the observed ratio by depopulation of metastable 3s excited states, and that the ratio can potentially be used as an independent diagnostic of plasma formation radius. We used the Flexible Atomic Code collisional-radiative model to model the effect of UV photoexcitation from O stars on the Fe xvii lines. We compared our model calculations to archival spectra of coronal and hot stars from the Chandra HETGS and XMM-Newton RGS to benchmark our calculations for various electron densities and UV field intensities. Our calculations show that UV photoexcitation does not produce a sufficiently large dynamic range in the 3F / (3F + 3G + M2) fraction to explain the difference in the observed ratio between coronal stars and ζ Pup. Thus, this effect likely cannot explain the observed line ratio of ζ Pup, and its origin is still unexplained."

Water temperature is a necessary variable used to compute water emissions that is required to be subtracted from satellite observation to yield actual emissions from the land portion, which in turn generates accurate soil moisture retrievals. Therefore, overestimation of soil moisture can often be corrected using concurrent water temperature data in the overall mitigation procedure. In recent years, several data sets of lake water temperature have become available, but their specifications and accuracy have rarely been investigated in the context of passive soil moisture remote sensing on a global scale. For this reason, three lake temperature products were evaluated against in-situ measurements from 2007 to 2011. The data sets include the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) from Global Observatory of Lake Responses to Environmental Change (GloboLakes), the Copernicus Global Land Operations Cryosphere and Water (C-GLOPS), as well as the lake mix-layer temperature (LMLT) from the European Centers for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 Land Reanalysis. GloboLakes, C-GLOPS, and ERA5 Land have overall comparable performance with Pearson correlations (R) of 0.87, 0.92 and 0.88 in comparison with in-situ measurements. LSWT products exhibit negative median biases of −0.27 K (GloboLakes) and −0.31 K (C-GLOPS), whereas the median bias of LMLT is 1.56 K. When mapped from their respective native resolutions to a common 9 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) Grid 2.0 projection, similar relative performance was observed. LMLT and LSWT data are closer in performance over the 9 km grid cells that exhibit a small range of lake cover fractions (0.05–0.5). Despite comparable relative performance, ERA5 Land shows great advantages in spatial coverage and temporal resolution. In summary, an integrated evaluation on data accuracy, long-term availability, global coverage, temporal resolution, and regular forward processing with modest data latency led us to conclude that LMLT from the ERA5 Land Reanalysis product represents the most optimal path for use in the development of a long-term soil moisture product."

But since the sense of the rotation itself is irrelevant in most contexts, some uncertainty and inconsistencies have arisen in the literature about this detail. Here, we start from basic plasma theory to describe the propagation of polarized emission from a background radio source through a magnetized, ionized medium in order to rederive the correct sense of Faraday rotation. We present simple graphics to illustrate the decomposition of a linearly polarized wave into right and left circularly polarized modes, the temporal and spatial propagation of the phases of those modes, and the resulting physical rotation of the polarization orientation. We then re-examine the case of a medium that both Faraday-rotates and emits polarized radiation and show how a helical magnetic field can construct or destruct the Faraday rotation. This paper aims to resolve a source of confusion that has arisen between the plasma physics and radio astronomy communities and to help avoid common pitfalls when working with this unintuitive phenomenon."

A theoretical and numerical investigation is performed to characterize the effects of nose bluntness on disturbance amplification over the circular cone for several angles of attack, with the goal of understanding the potential physical mechanisms behind the experimental observations. The three-dimensional laminar basic states over a 1.5 m long, 7-degree half-angle cone with 9.525 mm nosetip radius are computed for selected angles of attack values and freestream conditions that are selected to match the Mach 10 experiments conducted within the Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel 9 at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC). The solutions at a freestream unit Reynolds number of 17.1 million per meter are used to perform detailed instability analyses for angles of attack equal to 0, 1, 3, and 5 degrees. Results indicate that the linear amplification of stationary crossflow waves along inflection lines may begin to influence transition along the acreage of the cone for angles of attack equal to or larger than 5 degrees. The measured trend in transition front with respect to increasing angle of attack is found to be consistent with the predicted increase in the amplification factors for Mack mode disturbances along the streamline trajectories. The increase in Mack mode amplification along the windward ray for higher angles of attack is shown to be the result of a progressively earlier entropy-layer swallowing. Computations also indicate that the transition amplification factor along the windward ray is not constant and increases with the angle of attack and that the transition #-factors along the leeward ray are rather small. The nonmodal analysis for zero degrees angle of attack shows that entropy-layer disturbances with appreciably strong energy growth can coexist with Mack mode instabilities at the measured transition location."

For the demonstration, NASA’s prototype Tailored Arrival Manager(TAM) was used to compute efficient trajectory-based solutions to traffic management problems representing those encountered during time-based metering operations today. TAM solutions involving route modifications were uplinked to a Boeing 787 airplane using Controller Pilot Data Link Communications and seamlessly loaded into the airplane’s Flight Management System (FMS). The paper describes the concept and technology behind TAM along with the data exchanges and procedures involved with the demonstration. All TAM solutions were delivered in a timely manner and successfully integrated with the airplane’s FMS, thereby demonstrating the basic feasibility of trajectory-based arrival management using currently available data communications and avionics equipage. Although TAM solutions were not executed during this initial demonstration, a limited study of trajectory prediction accuracy was possible given that the airplane flew uninterrupted, automated descents with known route and speed intent. Analysis revealed that TAM meter-fix arrival time predictions were accurate to within ± 30 seconds for time horizons of 30 minutes or less, which matched closely with FMS predictions acquired through real-time data exchange. Top-of-descent predictions over similar time horizons were found accurate to within ± 5 nautical miles."

L-band  radiometry  has  proved to  be  one  of  the  best  methods  in  soil  moisture  estimation using microwave  signals.  However,  they  provide measurements  that correspond  to  a  shallow  depth  of  5  cm and   are   also   affected by   the   presence of overlaying vegetation  and roughness.  In contrast,  P-band  radiometry  is expected  to  provide  moisture information  on  a  deeper  layer of  soil.  Moreover, these  lower frequency  measurements  are expected to be less affected by soil roughness and vegetation contributions.   Consequently, this   pilot   study   uses   the Polarimetric  P-band  Multi beam  Radiometer(PPMR)  at  740 MHz to evaluate the response of theP-band radiometer over a  realistic  range  of  surface  condition sat  the  field  scale.

This  paper  presents  the  model  for  the  bare  soil condition observed  during  June  2018  to  August  2018.

Highly magnetized neutron stars called magnetars also generate energetic, short-duration gamma-ray transients called magnetar giant flares (MGFs). Three have been observed from the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies, and they have long been suspected to constitute a third class of extragalactic GRBs. We report the unambiguous identification of a distinct population of four local (<5 Mpc) short GRBs, adding GRB 070222 to previously discussed events. While identified solely based on alignment with nearby star-forming galaxies, their rise time and isotropic energy release are independently inconsistent with the larger short GRB population at >99.9% confidence. These properties, the host galaxies, and non-detection in gravitational waves all point to an extragalactic MGF origin. Despite the small sample, the inferred volumetric rates for events above 4 × 10(exp 44) erg of R(sub MGF) =3.8(sup +4.0)(sub -3.1) ×10(exp 5) Gpc(exp -3) yr(exp -1) make MGFs the dominant gamma-ray transient detected from extragalactic sources. As previously suggested, these rates imply that some magnetars produce multiple MGFs, providing a source of repeating GRBs.

These satellites have different vantage points above the Earth and different spectral imaging bands resulting in inconsistent imagery from one to another. This presents challenges in building downstream applications. What if we could generate synthetic bands for existing satellites from the union of all domains? We tackle the problem of generating synthetic spectral imagery for multispectral sensors as an unsupervised image-to-image translation problem modeled with a variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. Our approach introduces a novel shared spectral reconstruction loss to constrain the high-dimensional feature space of multispectral images. Simulated experiments performed by dropping one or more spectral bands show that cross-domain reconstruction outperforms measurements obtained from a second vantage point. Our proposed approach enables the synchronization of multispectral data and provides a basis for more homogeneous remote sensing datasets."

Solar sails, which use reflected sunlight to derive thrust, can be used to create artificial equilibria and near-indefinite station-keeping at locations sunward of L1 along the Sun Earth Line (SEL), or at any desired offset from the SEL leading or trailing the Earth in its orbit. They can change the heliocentric inclination of a spacecraft from the ecliptic to as high as solar polar, stopping and remaining at any intermediate inclination orbit in between or can be used around a range of solar system bodies. 

The Solar Cruiser mission will fly a small spacecraft (~100 kg) with a large (>1600 square meter) solar sail containing embedded reflectivity control devices (RCDs) and photovoltaic cells, attaining a characteristic acceleration of >0.12 mm/s2. The mission concept includes successful deployment of the solar sail, validation of all sail subsystems, controlled station-keeping inside of the Sun-Earth L1 point, demonstration of pointing performance for science imaging, and finally an increase in heliocentric inclination (out of the ecliptic plane).

Solar Cruiser would serve as a pathfinder for missions that observe the solar environment from unique vantage points such as a high inclination solar mission, opening a fundamentally new range of observational capabilities for the Heliophysics Program and for space weather monitoring. Observations away from the Sun-Earth line (SEL) present unique opportunities for answering the outstanding science questions of Heliophysics, for improving space-weather monitoring and prediction, and for revealing new discoveries about our Sun and solar system. High solar inclinations are particularly compelling. Investment in, and demonstration of, the technology needed to enable polar missions is essential to making this unique vantage point a reality in the next decade."

Specific missions to be accomplished during EVA surface and space operations will include construction and assembly, surface and geologic exploration, and excavation for protective shelter from radiation and significant solar particle events. EVA crews have limited time, resources, mobility, visibility and dexterity, and activities take place in a perceptually impoverished environment. Limitations include a loss of spatial reference frame leading to spatial disorientation, a loss of information normally provided by the auditory and somato-sensory systems, and a restricted field of view. In addition, in non-surface operations crew must be able to navigate and operate in a fully six degree of freedom (DoF) environment. Fatigue resulting from suited EVA tasks will also critically affect performance and safety. In order to mitigate these factors, it is important that crews be well trained prior to executing actual missions. There is a critical need to design multimodal interfaces to optimize performance under these conditions for both training and actual operations. Because of the high level of complexity of the EVA environment on the one hand, and the “sensory restrictions” on the other, it makes sense to envisage enhancements to the astronauts’ visual environment. Such an enriched environment may include virtual auditory as well as tactile inputs."

In this work, BME feedthrough capacitors compliant with AEC-Q200 requirements have been evaluated, screened and qualified for a space project.  Evaluation included analysis of the effect of post-soldering thermal shocks, temperature dependencies of leakage currents, distribution of breakdown voltages, assessments of high-current capability, and thermal resistance of the parts.  The parts have been screened and qualified at conditions close to the military requirements for ceramic capacitors.  No failures were detected during screening including burning-in, but two samples failed during monitored 2000 hour life testing at 125C and two times rated voltage.  Failure analysis revealed manufacturing defects that required additional analysis of screening and qualification test conditions.  Highly accelerated life testing (HALT) has been carried out to assess reliability acceleration factors and the probability of failure at the use conditions.  An approach to selection of adequate burning-in and life test conditions is discussed."

In this research, we describe our efforts training machine learning (ML) models to predict both departure and arrival runway assignments using an entirely data-driven approach. This approach is compared to existing rule-based approaches developed in previous research using input from Subject Matter Experts. The models have features derived from various FAA data feeds, and leverage multiple machine learning algorithms. Results for models trained for nine major U.S. airports are described and compared to one another across various important dimensions. Particular attention was paid to developing a repeatable framework for training these models so the approach could be scaled to other airports, and to developing models that are useful in a real-time environment. In addition, the models were designed to be functional in a real-time environment to support NASA’s ATD-2 project, as part of an ML-powered shadow system to compare against the performance of the fielded system."

The first step predicts a landing time by using mediation rules to select from among physics-based predictions (relying on the expected flight trajectory) already available in real time in the Federal Aviation Administration System Wide Information Management system data feeds. The second step uses a machine learning model built upon the mediated predictions. The model is trained to predict the error in the mediated prediction, using features describing the current state of an airborne flight. These features are calculated in real time from a relatively small number of data elements that are readily available for airborne flights. Initial results based on five months of data at six large airports demonstrate that incorporating a machine learning model on top of the mediated physics-based prediction can lead to substantial additional improvements in prediction quality."

Kedro, an open-source pipeline framework, is used to develop the model definition and training. Models are stored in scikit-learn containers on a MLFlow server where they can be retrieved and served to make predictions in the live system. These open source frameworks provide common structures between ML services, allow for easier maintenance and updates, and overall deliver an easier CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) process. The current models were trained on data acquired at KCLT and KDFW from June 1st to December 31st, 2019 and compute taxi time in the ramp, airport movement area (AMA) and total (from gates to runways). The current versions of the models achieve relatively low uncertainties of about 10 to 15% for the total and AMA taxi times and about 20% for the ramp taxi time at both KCLT and KDFW. Initial tests on offline data from 2020 and 2021 show a small degradation (10 to 15%) in accuracy performance indicating the model’s resilience to operational changes over time."

The scheduling is carried out by computer systems owned by the private operators of the flights, which interface through a centralized independent server. The scheduling requires determining which of the group of flights at hand (whether owned by the same operator or different ones) are to have the advantage of being scheduled before the others. A chosen method of grouping and prioritizing flights must: have the ability to schedule a flight promptly, prevent scheduling conflicts between pairs of overlapping flight routes, and be computationally feasible. Scheduling flights one by one is the First Come First Served policy. Scheduling too many at a time is infeasible. The type of scheduling policy proposed herein, called bin-and-sort, is an attempt to reach a compromise between these two extremes. Bin-and-sort allows for each operator to choose its criteria for prioritizing its flights, and for the centralized component to use different arbitration criteria. A number of these criteria are used in the simulation presented herein. The results of each criterion choice are reported and analyzed."

Advancing towards autonomy in air traffic management may be necessary in order for new air vehicle types such as electric Vertical Take Off and Landing (eVTOL) to operate safely and efficiently in airspace shared with conventional traffic. To account for uncertain prediction, autonomous air traffic management was divided into two integrated and coordinated subsystems: strategic scheduling, performed at predeparture, and tactical conflict detection and resolution, performed throughout the flight. The conflict detection and resolution subsystem contained a second tactical scheduling function that applied to flights operating in the airspace near the destination airport. This paper compares and contrasts the two subsystems and uses fast-time simulation to demonstrate the comparisons. A scenario of 54 flights inbound to Newark Liberty International Airport was simulated multiple times with different parameters. The scenario was created using flight plans recorded from the National Airspace System on a low weather, average traffic day in April 2018. Whereas the routes were not changed, the departure times of the flights were modified to increase arrival rates at the Newark runway and arrival meter fixes. Results of the simulations showed that the autonomous air traffic management system was able to safely manage the traffic, even with prediction uncertainty. In addition, they showed the importance of including flight holding maneuvers, in addition to path stretching, in conflict detection and resolution and of coordinating strategic and tactical scheduling. Finally, a tradeoff between absorbing the delay calculated by strategic scheduling on the ground versus in the air showed that taking most of the delay on the ground is cost effective for a simple idealized cost function. However, taking a little of the delay in the air prevented throughput on the runway from dropping for short periods due to trajectory prediction uncertainty."

This paper focuses on mitigation of shot noise which is introduced into the image data set by the cameras. Shot noise impacts the quality of data collected, increasing the system error in its pressure value calculations. This paper characterises statistical methods to reduce shot noise within experimental data by taking an average or weighted average across an area of pixels of their respective counts. Each combined-pixel has a higher total effective intensity value and therefore exhibits reduced noise throughout its time history. This is demonstrated by calculating the standard deviations of the combined pixel values through time, which decrease as the combined pixel area increases. Finally, these methods are compared across experimental wind tunnel conditions to examine their effectiveness at different Mach numbers. Ultimately, the results are used to recommend a blur filter type and size which will be applied to the raw image data prior to processing, as well as a minimum camera resolution for future experiments. Downstream of the filter application, the software to convert the 2D image data sets into surface pressure readings on a 3D grid use a ratio of decimation that assigns multiple pixels to each 3D grid node. This decimation ratio will also be aligned with the size of the blur filter, resulting in a more manageable data set size and compromised spatial resolution. Combined with the effect of the blur filter, the resulting pixel intensity readings will exhibit significantly reduced shot noise, reducing the magnitude of uncertainty and error in the final calculated pressure. For future tests, the camera spatial resolution must be sufficient to capture small flow and model features even after the recommended blur filter is applied. The image data set is taken from a uPSP experiment of the Space Launch System Block 1 cargo vehicle model in September 2019."

Here, we examine the first two years (2018-2020) of Arctic Ocean sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) from the photon-counting laser altimeter onboard NASA’s ICE, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). ICESat-2 SSHA estimates are compared to estimates from ESA’s CryoSat-2 mission, including semi-synchronous along-track measurements from the recent CRYO2ICE orbit alignment campaign. There are documented residual centimeter-scale range biases between the ICESat-2 beams (in release-003 data) and we opted for a single-beam approach in our comparisons. We find good agreement in the along-track estimates (spatial correlation coefficient >0.8 and mean differences <0.03 m) as well as in the gridded monthly SSHA estimates (temporal correlation coefficient of 0.76 and a mean difference of 0.01 m) from the two altimeters, suggesting ICESat-2 adds to the CryoSat-2 SSHA estimates."

For this assessment, tantalum capacitors are typically subjected to reliability testing at temperatures and voltages exceeding their specified values, and the failure rate (FR) — or the probability of failure during use conditions — is calculated based on voltage and temperature acceleration factors. In this work, various types and lots of polymer tantalum capacitors have been tested at highly accelerated life test (HALT) conditions and the acceleration factors have been determined using different techniques. It has been shown that the behavior of capacitors under HALT conditions can be described based on the time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) model, which explains the presence of infant mortality (IM) and wear-out failures using the same failure mechanisms and allows for an assessment of the acceleration factors. The difference in acceleration factors obtained using exponential and power models is discussed. Analysis shows that with proper derating, screening, and qualification testing, the reliability of frameless Hi-Rel COTS polymer tantalum capacitors is adequate for space missions."

The difficulty of fitting such data is compounded when the LET of the ion responsible for an SEE is uncertain.  We modify a Generalized Linear Model SEE data fitting methodology to accommodate uncertain LET and apply the method to the problem of backside heavy-ion SEE testing to demonstrate the utility of the method, explore the dependence of systematic errors that arise from improper treatment of LET uncertainty and develop guidelines for minimizing such systematic errors when proper treatment is not possible.

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has an aggressive approach to RFI detection and filtering using dedicated spaceflight hardware and ground processing software. As more sensors push to observe at larger bandwidths in unprotected or shared spectrum, RFI detection continues to be essential. This article presents a deep learning approach to RFI detection using SMAP spectrogram data as input images. The study utilizes the benefits of transfer learning to evaluate the viability of this method for RFI detection in microwave radiometers.

The stagnation-point thermal response is further evaluated using a Monte Carlo global sensitivity analysis to determine the interactions between key parameters in the material surface energy balance, such as, convective blowing correction parameter and weave material properties including isotropic and orthotropic thermal conductivites. The time-accurate material response for the dual layer weave erosion and surface temperatures show excellent agreement with stagnation flat face arc-jet tests involving time-varying aeroheating-cooling cycles.  The high-fidelity Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis technique was used to address challenges in thermal protection sizing for the Adaptive Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT) system, a low ballistic coefficient hypersonic decelerator. The results represent new correlations for such weaves involving Carbon-air oxidation equilibrium chemistry. Through the multi-variate regression analyses and uncertainty rankings performed, only three properties were found to contribute to the transient thermal response of the gore, with emissivity contributing to nearly 95% of the total output uncertainty."

This galaxy, dubbed“Dichromatic Primeval Galaxy”atz∼7(DP7), shows two distinct components. While fairly unremarkable in terms of its ultraviolet(UV)luminosity(~L0.3UV*,whereLUV*is the characteristic luminosity), DP7 has one of the highest observed Lyαequivalent widths(EWs)amongLyαemitters atz>6(>200Åin the rest frame). The strong Lyαemission generally suggests a young metal-poor, low-dust galaxy; however, we find that the UV slopeβof the galaxy as a whole is redder than typical star-forming galaxies at these redshifts,−1.13±0.84, likely indicating, on average, a considerable amount of dust obscuration, or an older stellar population. When we measureβfor the two components separately, however, we find evidence of differing UVcolors, suggesting two separate stellar populations. Also, we find that Lyαis spatially extended and likely larger than the galaxy size, hinting to the possible existence of a Lyαhalo. Rejuvenation or merging events could explain these results.Either scenario requires an extreme stellar population, possibly including a component of Population III stars, or an obscured active galactic nucleus. DP7, with its low UV luminosity and high LyαEW, represents the typical galaxies that are thought to be the major contribution to the reionization of the universe, and for this reason DP7 is an excellent target for follow-up with the James Webb Space Telescope"

Temperature, light, atmospheric water demand, soil moisture and leaf water potential vary over the course of the day, leading to diurnal variations in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration. Earth observations from polar-orbiting satellites are incapable of studying these diurnal variations. Here, we review the emerging satellite observations that have the potential for studying how plant functioning and ecosystem processes vary over the course of the diurnal cycle. The recently launched ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) provide land surface temperature, evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary production (GPP) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data at different times of day. New generation operational geostationary satellites such as Himawari-8 and the GOES-R series can provide continuous, high-frequency data of land surface temperature, solar radiation, GPP and ET. Future satellite missions such as GeoCarb, TEMPO and Sentinel-4 are also planned to have diurnal sampling capability of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. We explore the unprecedented opportunities for characterizing and understanding how GPP, ET and water use efficiency vary over the course of the day in response to temperature and water stresses, and management practices. We also envision that these emerging observations will revolutionize studies of plant functioning and ecosystem processes in the context of climate change and that these observations and findings can inform agricultural and forest management and lead to improvements in Earth system models and climate projections."

The non-causal controller design is based on a loop shaping approach. Partial fraction decomposition is used, along with derivative approximations, to derive a proper transfer function design for a causal control structure. The premise for this non-causal control methodology is that the phase delay as a function of frequency  ideally remains  within  approximately  -90o, which  tends to make the system robustly stable to uncertainties in the plant dynamics. To have a predictable control system response in lieu of the tolerance of this methodology to relatively large uncertainty in the plant dynamics, the approach is augmented with model reference control. The addition of model reference control can potentially further enhance the robustness of the design. A control system design example is presented in this paper, along with simulation results, to demonstrate the high degree of robustness of this non-causal methodology and its augmentation."

The solution exploits the symmetry of volumetric sink conditions at opposing ends of such a `double-drained' interior corner flow with applications ranging from liquid recovery in microfluidic devices on earth to liquid fuels scavenging in large fuel tanks aboard spacecraft. At long times t, the liquid depth is h~t^n, the liquid volume is V~ t^(2n), and the maximum volumetric liquid removal rate is Q~t^(2n-1), where n =-1. Representative experiments are conducted at larger length scales aboard the International Space Station and at microfluidic length scales in a terrestrial laboratory. Both sets of experiments confirm the solutions. We show that the approach offers a method to predict maximum drain rates from related geometries where a single drain location provides the required symmetry. We also show that the `fixed length' solution is one of many practical similarity solutions to the governing nonlinear evolution equation for the transient liquid profile along the interior corner.
Exponential asymptotic Fourier series solutions are also found for partial corner fillling as well as draining."

Instability measurements were acquired under noisy-flow and quiet-flow conditions. Pitot-pressure and calibrated hot-wire measurements were obtained using a model-integrated traverse system to document the model flow field. In noisy-flow conditions, growth rates and mode shapes achieved good agreement between the measured results and
linear stability theory (LST). The corresponding N factor at transition from LST is N ≈ 3.9. Under quiet-flow conditions, the most unstable first-mode instabilities as predicted by LST were measured, but this mode was not the dominant instability measured in the boundary layer. Instead, the dominant instabilities were less-amplified, low-frequency disturbances predicted by LST, and grew according to linear theory. These low-frequency unstable disturbances were initiated by freestream acoustic disturbances through a receptivity process believed to occur near the branch I location of the cone. Under quiet-flow conditions, the boundary layer remained

SRB Release 4 Intergrated Product (Rel4-IP) integrates data products from the cloud, aerosol, atmosphere, ocean surface, and land surface projects within GDAP to produce a long-term time series of Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) and surface radiative estimates. This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the various inputs, algorithms and resulting top-of-atmosphere and surface flux products that span from July 1983 through June 2017.  Comparisons of the TOA flux products are made to overlapping CERES data products when possible.  The surface radiative flux products are assessed relative to the globally distribution Baseline Surface Radiation Network measurements sites.  Variability of the various products are compared to ERBE and CERES during overlapping time periods.  The variability of the product show excellent correspondent to CERES during overlap years and improved statistical agreement with surface measurements.  This document also discusses known issues with the data products to help the user understand the uncertainty and known issues."

Several of those ice-crusted bodies show evidence of tectonic activity indicating high levels of stress. This paper reports on laboratory experiments with pure H2O ice and H2O2–doped H2O ices with H2O2 concentration levels comparable to those in the ices of Europa. Elongated rectangular ice blocks at T = −81 °C [192 K] were stressed at one end to test whether electric currents are generated and capable of flowing down the stress gradient. Pure H2O ice was found to not produce currents above the 10−10 A background level except for occasional transients in the 10−9–10−8 A range during fracture or rapid plastic deformation due to electrons, e’. By contrast, stressing H2O2-doped H2O ices consistently produced electric currents in the 10−7–10−5 A range, due to holes, h•, propagating from the stressed end to the unstressed end. The h• charge carriers are generated by the break-up of peroxy bonds of H2O2 molecules, leading to O−, equivalent to defect electrons or holes h• in the O2− matrix."

We use the highly efficient MIDAS to perform electromagnetic scattering calculations to evaluate the gain in efficiency from these schemes. MIDAS is shown to be superior to DDSCAT, a popular discrete dipole approximation (DDA) method. This study is motivated by the fact that quality physical precipitation retrievals rely on using accurate orientation-averaged SSPs derived from realistic hydrometeors as input to radiative transfer Models (RTMs). The DDA has been a popular choice for single-scattering calculations, due to its versatility with respect to target geometry. However, being iterative-solver-based (ISB), the most used DDA codes, e.g. DDSCAT and ADDA, must solve the scattering problem for each orientation of the target separately. As the size parameter and geometric anisotropy of the hydrometeor increase, the number of orientations needed to obtain accurate orientation-averages can increase drastically and so does the computation cost incurred by the ISB-DDA methods. MIDAS is a Direct-Solver-Based (DSB) code, its decomposition of the original large matrix with a high rank into multiple more manageable smaller matrices of lower ranks makes it much more computationally efficient while maintaining excellent accuracy. In addition, direct solvers consider all requested orientations at once, giving MIDAS further advantage over popular ISB-DDA methods. MIDAS, when combined with high-order quadrature for orientation averaging, can be greater than three orders of magnitude more efficient in obtaining RTM-ready SSPs of complex-shaped hydrometeors than existing ISB-DDA methods, with the native quadrature schemes they offer."

Furthermore, in the pursuit of improved fuel burn, engine overall pressure ratio and bypass ratio will increase, further driving down engine core size (core size being defined as high-pressure compressor [HPC] exit-corrected flow). These drivers together mean that the core size for future single-aisle aircraft applications will shrink below 3.0 lb/s. Traditionally, this small core compressor size is in the domain of axi-centrifugal designs, machines that are typically less efficient and limited to pressure ratios of ~25 due to stress and thermomechanical fatigue in the centrifugal impeller. In this light, NASA and Pratt & Whtiney (P&W) embarked upon a program to develop technologies to enable an all-axial high-pressure compressor with a core size below 3.0 lb/s and an overall pressure ratio greater than 50. The challenge with an all-axial high-pressure compressor at this core size is the small span at the rear of the compressor. As core size is scaled down, the rotor tip clearances, stator hub seal clearances, fillet sizes and leading edge thicknesses do not scale, leading to significant efficiency penalties. The goal of this program is to recover this lapse and realize the cycle benefits of small core size and high overall pressure ratio. The small core challenges described are mitigated through design optimization and technology insertion, enabling an estimated 5 to 10% fuel burn reduction relative to 2020 best-in-class. Three test rigs run at NASA Glenn Research Center evolved the small core design: a low-speed rig to vet technology and validate tools, and two high speeds rigs, the first to demonstrate an optimized meanline design and the second to validate technology to manage large rotor tip gaps. The efficiency improvement validated with these rigs has unlocked the small core design space, demonstrating that small core compressors can maintain a similar efficiency to current best-in-class large core size compressors. In addition to advancing the state-of-the-art of technology, the program has also advanced the modeling standards for multistage compressors with large clearance-to-span ratios. A best practice modeling standard was developed over the course of the program, incorporating learning from all three rig programs."

Several mechanisms are believed to be responsible for Arctic amplification; however, a quantitative understanding of their relative importance is still missing. Here, using ensembles of model integrations, we quantify the contribution of ocean coupling, both its thermodynamic and dynamic components, to Arctic amplification over the 20th and 21st centuries. We show that ocean coupling accounts for ~80% of the amplification by 2100. In particular, we show that thermodynamic coupling is responsible for future amplification and sea-ice loss as it overcomes the effect of dynamic coupling which reduces the amplification and sea-ice loss by ~35%. Our results demonstrate the utility of targeted numerical experiments to quantify the role of specific mechanisms in Arctic amplification, for better constraining climate projections."

Since the mission is focused on generating accurate elevations and elevation change, the geolocation (or geodetic position) of the measurements are of upmost importance to each of the scientific disciplines supported by these observations. Geolocation validation is required to ensure that the mission is meeting its objectives with the appropriate level of geolocation accuracy. One validation technique uses small optical reflectors placed in a specific pattern along one or more satellite ground-tracks. The optics provide a unique signal back to the satellite that can be used to compare the geolocation of these returns in the data to the known position on the surface. Results of the position comparison indicate the measurement locations are accurate to within 3.5 m with a standard deviation of 1.6 m. They also provide a method for determining a representative footprint diameter using geometric analysis, which resulted in an average value of 10.9 m +- 2.1 m."

Using  the  Neutron  Star  Interior Composition Explorer, we started observing the source three hours after the burst was detected with MAXI/GSC, and monitored the source for the subsequent twelve days.  We observed the tail end of the X-ray burst cooling phase, and find that the X-ray flux is severely depressed relative to its historic value for a three day period directly following the burst.  We interpret this intensity dip as the inner accretion disk gradually restoring itself after being perturbed by the burst irradiation.  Superimposed on this trend we observed a 1.5 d interval during which the X-ray flux is sharply lower than the wider trend.  This drop in flux could be isolated to the non-thermal components in the energy spectrum, suggesting that it may be caused by an evolving corona.  Additionally, we detected a 3.4 keV absorption line at 6.3σsignificance in a single 472 s observation while the burst emission was still bright.  We tentatively identify the line as a gravitationally redshifted absorption line from burning ashes on the stellar surface, possibly associated with 40Ca or 44Ti."

Consistent broadband flux derivation depends on accurate radiative property measurements and cloud retrievals, which largely determine the radiance-to-flux conversion process. Therefore, it is important to ensure a high quality of cloud property input in order to maintain a reliable broadband flux record. In Edition 4 of the CERES SYN1deg product, a robust automated image anomaly detection algorithm based on inter-line and inter-pixel differences, spatial variance, and 2-D Fourier analysis has been successful in identifying imagery with linear artifacts, but the line-by-line inspection and cleaning process must still be performed by a human. Therefore, further automation of this quality assurance process is warranted, especially considering the excessive amount of additional cleaning necessitated by the GOES-17 Advance Baseline Imager (ABI) cooling system anomaly. As such, this article highlights advancement of the CERES GEO image artifact cleaning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification of bad scanlines. Once trained, the CNN approach is a computationally inexpensive means to ensure greater consistency in cloud retrievals, and therefore broadband flux derivation, based on GOES-17 measurements."

We compare the upper bounds for the gas production rate (~10^(24) molecules/s) measured by the New Horizons (NH) spacecraft flyby on 01 Jan 2019 to estimates for the outgassing flux rates from a suite of common cometary and KBO ices at the average ~ 40 K sunlit surface temperature of MU69, but do not find the upper limit very constraining except for the most volatile of species (e.g. CO, N2, CH4). More constraining is the stability versus sublimation into vacuum requirement over Myr to Gyr, and from this we find only 3 common ices that are truly refractory: HCN, CH3OH, and H2O (in order of increasing stability), while NH3 and H2CO ices are marginally stable and may be removed by any positive temperature excursions in the EKB, as produced every 10^(8)–10^(9) years by nearby supernovae and passing O/B stars. To date the NH team has reported the presence of abundant CH3OH and H2O on MU69's surface (Stern et al., 2019; Grundy et al., 2020). NH3 has been searched for, but not found. We predict that future absorption feature detections, if any are ever derived from higher signal-to-noise ratio spectra, will be due to an HCN or poly-H2CO based species. Consideration of the conditions present in the EKB region during the formation era of MU69 lead us to state that it is highly likely that it “formed in the dark”, in an optically thick mid-plane, unable to see the nascent, variable, highly luminous Young Stellar Object (YSO)/TTauri Sun, and that KBOs contain HCN and CH3OH ice phases in addition to the H2O ice phases found in their short period (SP) comet descendants. Finally, when we apply our ice thermal stability analysis to bodies/populations related to MU69, we find that methanol ice is likely ubiquitous in the outer solar system; that if Pluto isn't a fully differentiated body, then it must have gained its hypervolatile ices from proto-planetary disk (PPD) sources in the first few Myr of the solar system's existence; and that hypervolatile rich, highly primordial comet C/2016 R2 was placed onto an Oort Cloud orbit on a similar few Myr timescale."

To enable this requirement, novel aircraft functionalities and technologies as well as supporting airworthiness and operational regulations are required.  A structured method to derive a comprehensive list of aircraft level decision-making functions is defined and applied.  The resulting function set is programmed into an ontology, and enables autonomous decision-making through the application of a defined decision-making process.  Paths to implementing the functions are generated by applying a structured four step method.  By surveying current technologies, airspace, procedures and regulations, the paths generation method defines incremental paths to autonomy that the current regulatory environment can support.  Opportunities to implement novel technologies and functions are identified, and regulatory mechanisms supporting their implementation are underscored.  The analysis provides the tools to further define aircraft functions and paths to their implementation, while demonstrating that for particular use cases, aircraft autonomy is attainable in the medium-term."

Flaps are high-lift devices used by planes to allow for quicker takeoffs, and slower landings. A computer-based aircraft model of the flaps of an aircraft was developed using the Python based open-source framework OpenMDAO. OpenMDAO is used to develop multi-disciplinary aircraft models using gradient-based optimization; design optimization (MDO) is concerned with solving design problems involving numerical models of complex engineering systems. There were 4 components in the model; each has input values, output variables, and equations to calculate said outputs. The variables and equations are sourced from NASA Fortran code from the 1970s, in a project called the General Aviation Synthesis Program (GASP). These variables and equations which create the model are being converted to Python for ease of use. The flaps model developed will be integrated into a larger model of a conventional aircraft’s flight phases. All subsystems of the model will first be built using the parameters of a Boeing 737 MAX-8, to validate its functionality and accuracy. Then, the aircraft model will be used for hybrid-electric research; running optimizations to improve efficiency, minimize fuel burn, and advance hybrid-electric technology in the aerospace field."

Natural sources such as wetlands and inland aquatic systems (i.e., reservoirs, lakes, rivers) contribute substantially to global emissions but these natural systems comprise the most uncertain components of the CH4 budget. This study addresses multiple gaps and uncertainties associated with global CH4 emissions from reservoirs and undertakes a spatial and temporal assessment of global reservoir emissions. The results from this study suggest that reservoirs occupy a global area about 300,000 km2 (comparable to the size of the country of Italy) and emit 10.1 Tg CH4 yr-1. We identify data and methodological elements of previous estimates that indicate they may overestimate these emissions.

The rainfall that cyclones bring compounds these conditions and, in hilly or mountainous areas, can trigger landslides that cause even more widespread and devastating impacts. When extreme precipitation occurs over short time frames, hillslopes may become saturated and critically unstable. The most intense storms can trigger thousands of landslides in mountainous areas, as was dramatically illustrated in Puerto Rico in September 2017, when Hurricane Maria’s rains left the landscape scarred by roughly 40,000 landslides.

Before and during a major cyclone, disaster responders need information about where landslides are likely to occur. In the aftermath, locating landslides quickly helps authorities direct resources to where they are most needed to save people and critical infrastructure. However, this information is often unavailable during an event response or is presented only for small regions, constraining the effectiveness of response efforts."

Modern L-band instruments, such as the radiometers on SMOS and Aquarius, have demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring surface salinity from space, and they have also demonstrated the need for better accuracy, especially in cold water. Proposals to improve accuracy have largely involved adding measurement at more frequencies. For example, adding lower frequencies to improve the sensitivity to salinity in cold water and adding higher frequencies to enable simultaneous retrieval of sea surface temperature which is needed in the retrieval of salinity. These strategies involve trade-offs, some obvious such as the effects of interference from anthropogenic sources of radio frequency radiation (RFI) when operating outside the protected band and the loss of spatial resolution at lower frequencies. But, some are more subtle and arise because of the dependence of the retrieval of salinity on other parameters of the ocean surface, in particular, water temperature and roughness (wind speed). The effect of these interdependencies on the potential accuracy of salinity remote sensing in the frequency range 0.3 – 3.0 GHz is examined here to gain insight into the potential for future wide bandwidth instruments for remote sensing of salinity and the optimization of their design. There is benefit including the low frequencies, especially for cold water, but a danger of increased error including frequencies above 1.5 - 2.0 GHz depending on temperature."

Inaccurate cloud masking is a great source of uncertainty. One main region that is prone to error in cloud masking is the sunglint area over ocean surfaces. Cloud detection over these regions is challenging for the EPIC instrument because of its limited spectral channels. Clear sky ocean surface reflectance from visible channels over sunglint is much larger than that over the non-glint areas and can exceed reflectance from thin clouds. This paper presents an improved EPIC ocean cloud masking algorithm (Version 3). Over sunglint regions (glint angle ≤ 25°), the algorithm utilizes EPIC’s oxygen (O2) A-band ratio (764nm to 780 nm) in addition to the 780 nm reflectance observations in masking tests. Outside the sunglint regions, a dynamic reflectance threshold for the Rayleigh corrected 780 nm reflectance is applied. The thresholds are derived as a function of glint angle. When compared with co-located data from the geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and the low Earth orbit (LEO) observations, the consistency of the new ocean cloud mask algorithm has increased by 4~10% and 4~6% in the glint center and granule edges respectively. The false positive rate is reduced by 10~17%. Overall global ocean cloud detection consistency increases by 2%. This algorithm, along with other improvements to the EPIC cloud masks, has been implemented in the EPIC cloud products Version 3. This algorithm will improve the cloud daily variability analysis by removing the artificial peak at local noon time in the glint center latitudes and reducing biases in the early morning and late afternoon cloud fraction over ocean surfaces."

The new flows, Cases D and E, are similar to the earlier ones (Cases A–C) in that a transpiration profile above a flat plate creates a prolonged adverse pressure gradient (APG) that drives a canonical turbulent zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG), flat-plate boundary layer towards separation; they differ in that for the new cases (1) the APG is not followed by a favorable gradient (FPG), since only suction transpiration is employed, and (2) the mean shear stress does not cross zero, so that the width of the mean bubble, strictly defined, is essentially zero. However, the probability of reversed skin friction exceeds 49%. The motivation was to produce a flow that is more akin to technological flows, including shock-boundary-layer interaction, with a gradual turbulence-controlled recovery.

Rather than relying on radiative transfer model generated fluxes from observed cloud-type retrievals, the CERES FluxByCloudType (FBCT) product, relies on MODIS empirical narrowband to broadband relationships to convert the cloudy portions of the CERES footprints into fluxes. The overcast footprint and sub-footprint cloud layer fluxes are then stratified by 7 pressure layers and 6 optical depth bins and temporally averaged into daily and monthly regional cloud-type fluxes.
The CERES project analyzed a total of 19 MODIS channels for use in the next generation FBCT product narrowband to broadband conversion. This was accomplished by comparing the narrowband to broadband RMS errors from all possible 5-channel combinations. The SW and LW optimized channels were selected by also considering analogous geostationary, MODIS and VIIRS imager channels as well as channel combinations that provided the lowest RMS errors across all surface types. The optimized channel combinations will be tested in the FBCT algorithm to investigate any cloud fraction, effective pressure, optical depth, PW, solar and view angle, surface type and regional narrowband to broadband dependencies."

Research conducted by NASA’s predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), and early years of NASA focused on turbojet noise, where a common approach for reducing jet noise was to limit the jet exit velocity to speeds that provided acceptable noise levels. Suppressors tested during this time resulted in thrust losses that were too severe to be implemented. With the introduction of turbofan engines in the 1960s, NASA shifted research to programs for both subsonic and supersonic aircraft applications with specific noise reduction goals. Subsonic research focused on increasing the bypass ratio of the engine to reduce the jet exit velocity of the core exhaust and adding mixers to the dual exhaust streams. Advances in computational methods improved aerodynamic designs and jet noise prediction tools.  Supersonic applications proved to be more troublesome as programs aimed at large commercial transports required higher specific thrust engines. Changing the engine cycle to reduce jet noise was not compatible with mission range and speed requirements. Research for supersonic commercial aircraft remains an area of interest today at NASA."

The liquid water content measured by the total water content sensor of the probe agreed well with the tunnel calibration over a wide range of MVDs, not unexpectedly since the tunnel was calibrated with a similar Multiwire hot-wire probe. A scale factor difference of about 7% was attributed to the lack of an efficiency correction for the Ice Crystal Detector at smaller median volume diameters, and typical sample area uncertainties of liquid water content devices. In addition, the simultaneous equations that are used to retrieve liquid and ice water contents were tested under liquid and glaciated conditions. Using constant ice and water efficiencies for each wire, the equations were found to produce a large and false ice water content retrieval in large median volume diameter liquid cases. By applying a liquid efficiency to the liquid water content sensor that varied with median volume diameter, retrievals were improved such that false ice water content was less than ±10% of the total water content out to the 460 μm median volume diameter limit of the testing. The probe was also tested in glaciated conditions by freezing out a small median volume diameter spray. Using constant ice efficiencies for the two sensors provided from aircraft measurements, the retrieved ice water content was about 40% higher than expected for the case presented, likely due to the ice efficiencies that were used from aircraft measurements of natural clouds being too low for the tunnel’s glaciated sprays. Application of ice efficiencies that vary with particle size and potentially other parameters will be explored for future improvement of retrievals."

The NASA DEVELOP team partnered with the Ugyen Wangchuck Institute of Conservation and Environmental Research (UWICER), the Bhutan Foundation, and the Karuna Foundation to assess forest changes for the districts of Bumthang and Haa from 2000 to 2018. The project used preprocessed meteorological data from the Climate Hazards Center Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Famine Early Warning System Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), along with Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) to assess apparent forest disturbance occurrences and observed climate trends. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was used to resolve variations in elevation and slope for mountainous regions. Using the Google Earth Engine LandTrendr (LT) code algorithm, along with Landsat data, the team developed an app called Forest Disturbances Detection Toolbox (FDDT) to assess forest changes in Bhutan. The app includes climate variables for the focus districts, along with LT variables, which allows the end users to further examine the cause of disturbances. The team compared geocoordinates for known disturbances with LT disturbance detection products. Although additional work is needed in the future to validate the project end products from the FDDT, the tool will be provided to the project partners to aid forest management efforts in Bhutan."

The project raises concerns about potential impacts on the nearby Florida reef tract through increased turbidity and sediment from the dredging. To better understand these potential impacts, the NASA DEVELOP team created an interactive Google Earth Engine tool to help establish a historical baseline of water quality parameters and assist monitoring these parameters more frequently than traditional sampling. This Seaport & Harbor Area Resource Quality (SHARQ) tool incorporates remotely sensed data from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. It allows users to view true color images and calculate water quality parameters, like turbidity and chlorophyll-a, for any given study area and time period from 1984 onward. The SHARQ tool also generate time series charts, allowing users to interpret changes in water quality over a given time range. The accuracy of the remotely sensed water quality parameter algorithms was determined using in situ data to calculate percent difference and root mean square error values (RMSE), which ranged from 0.32 to 0.58 error between sites. Using the SHARQ tool’s time series analysis feature, a baseline average turbidity metric of ~6.8 FNUs provides a historical baseline average for turbidity between September 2000 and 2020 and can assist in future decision-making for determining thresholds for turbidity."

Crop diversification and cultivating small grains is economically and ecologically advantageous, but limited in practice due to a lack of data about small-grain crop performance as well as monoculture-favoring insurance coverage, economic incentives, and sociocultural traditions. Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI) strives to create more sustainable agriculture and supports Midwestern farmers in adding small grains into their crop rotations. The DEVELOP team partnered with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and the USA National Phenology Network to assist PFI in applying NASA Earth observation data to track small-grain crop performance. This project developed a Google Earth Engine user interface that enables PFI farmers to compare satellite-assessed vegetation production and climatic conditions of their farm with other PFI farmers. The team assessed the crop performance through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). Additionally, the team created a regression model to analyze the predictive properties of vegetation indices and crop yield, ultimately establishing a relationship with mean NDVI from the early growing season. PFI farmers can utilize these products to make informed decisions about their crop production as well as advocate for more expansive insurance policies to protect small-grain crops."

Forested inundation affects the ability of forested wetlands to provide ecosystem services, such as flood mitigation, water filtration, carbon storage, and erosion mitigation. While ground-based monitoring has traditionally been used to map inundation extent, those methods are costly and time-intensive. The NASA DEVELOP team focused on seasonal inundation throughout 2008 in the Maya Forest, when changes in inundation were drastic. To monitor seasonal inundation, our team used in situ field data and Earth observations from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) 1, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and products from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). The team applied a Random Forest algorithm to Landsat 7 imagery, generating an object-level land cover classification with an overall accuracy of 72.1% and forest class with 100% recall and 78% precision. The team applied L-band backscatter thresholds from existing literature to forest-masked ALOS imagery and refined the thresholds in an iterative process using field data and hydrology models to delineate seasonal inundation extent. These publicly available data products help end users from Belize’s Land Information Center (LIC) and Forest Department, Guatemala’s Center for Monitoring and Evaluation (CEMEC), and Mexico’s El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR) to inform land management and protect community infrastructure."

Many drought indices are implemented to monitor the current extent and status of drought so stakeholders such as farmers and local governments can appropriately respond. Methods toforecast drought conditions weeks to months in advance are less common but would provide a more effective early warning system to enhance drought response, mitigation, and adaptation planning. To resolve this issue, we introduce DroughtCast, a machine learning framework for forecasting the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). DroughtCast operates on the knowledge that recent anomalies in hydrology and meteorology drive future changes in drought conditions. We use simulated meteorology and satellite observed soil moisture as inputs into a recurrent neural network to accurately forecast the USDM between 1 and 12 weeks into the future. Our analysis shows that precipitation, soil moisture, and temperature are the most important input variables when forecasting future drought conditions. Additionally, a case study of the 2017 Northern Plains Flash Drought shows that DroughtCast was able to forecast a very extreme drought event up to 12 weeks before its onset. Given the favorable forecasting skill of the model, DroughtCast may provide a promising tool for land managers and local governments in preparing for and mitigating the effects of drought."

The workshops brought together participants from nine international space agencies or organizations, with stakeholders consisting of research managers, discipline experts, technology developers, flight physicians, flight operators, and astronauts.  Breakout meetings and brainstorming sessions were conducted focusing on the following topics:  Critical hazards and countermeasures for the transit to Mars; gravity transitions and early surface operations; environmental control and life support systems; food systems; human microbiome, microbial monitoring, and planetary protection; medical operations for Mars missions; isolation and confinement; autonomous systems and crew-centered autonomy; and communications delay effects on operations.
In many cases the scenarios and approaches identified were compelling but challenging to implement under the current utilization structure used to manage the ISS for experiments.  Following the series of workshops, a team of utilization leaders across the ISS partnership worked to compile the workshop recommendations and extract a set of use-cases with their prerequisites and constraints.  The work considered the following aspects:  what can be effectively done on ISS; which new technologies, approaches and scenarios are feasible; what alternatives could be considered; and what steps should be taken to enable integrated testing and future use of ISS as an analog for Mars missions.  The final report will be published so that the use cases can be considered in each agency’s strategic planning processes. 

This paper will cover the process of international assessment in detail and how this process has influenced and broadened the vision of ISS utilization beyond single experiments to integrated studies and testing for future Mars missions.  This approach to international collaboration informs both the next decade of international exploration research on the ISS and advancement of its utilization as an analog for deep space missions.  For many of the participating partners, it also helps to frame the strategy for human research in Artemis as we begin planning for human missions to the moon.  We conclude with a summary of the progress on the actions in the report and the additional implementation discussions that have occurred across the partnership."

We analyzed five Moroccan cities selected for their different local climate, size, and typology during summer at three different spatial scales. The results show multiple causes defining the different forms and amplitudes of the UHI, namely: the ambient climate, the proximity to the sea, the presence of landscaped areas, and the color of building roofs and walls. Contrary to what was expected, the vegetation was not systematically an island of coolness, either because of its typology or its irrigation status. In the coastal cities of Tangier and Casablanca, UHIs around 20°C are observed on the seaside, whereas a UHS of up to 11°C is observed between the city center and the southern periphery of Casablanca. A moderate amplitude UHI of 7°C is formed in the mountainous city of Ifrane. For cities built in desert-like environments, well-defined UHSs between 9°C and 12°C are observed in Smara and Marrakech, respectively. At a finer scale, towns recorded lower temperatures than their immediate surroundings, which are attributed to evaporation from irrigated plants."

In particular, individual radiation sensitivity is strictly related to the risk of space radiation carcinogenesis. Therefore, in view of future missions to the Moon and Mars, there is an urgent need to estimate as accurately as possible the individual risk from space exposure to improve the safety of space exploration. In this review, we survey the combined effects from the two main physical components of the space environment, ionizing radiation and microgravity, to alter the genetics and epigenetics of human cells, considering both real and simulated space conditions. Data collected from studies on human cells are discussed for their potential use to estimate individual radiation carcinogenesis risk from space exposure."

It is expected that deployment of welding and additive manufacturing technologies in the space environment has the potential to revolutionise how orbiting platforms are designed, manufactured, and assembled. However, the structure, composition and quality of a weld is extremely dependent on the environment and can be difficult to control in space. Shielding gases would also be tough to manage as gases behave differently in zero gravity and airless environments. Additional points of concern are related to the spatter and sparks dynamics in space. Therefore, there is a need for a more basic understanding of welding processes by computational modelling. To provide such an insight we developed state of art models of the ARC torch, droplet detachment and transfer, and the melt pool build up using magnetohydrodynamics approximation and level set method for two-phase liquid metal/-gas flow modelling. Two finite element models were built using 2D axisymmetric geometry in COMSOL Multiphysics®: (i) stationary model of the ARC torch and (ii) dynamical model of droplet detachment and transfer. Both models demonstrate reasonable agreement with earlier experimental observations and high sensitivity to the temperature dependence of the thermophysical parameters on the system materials. The models were used to provide physical insight into ARC welding in various environments and geometries. It was shown, in particular, that there is a significant probability of gas bubbles trapping in the meltpool and a possibility of unbounded wondering of sparks in the welding chamber in zero gravity. In addition, we estimated metal evaporation rate that may be hazardous in the confined environment of the ISS. These issues raise concern of quality of the weld and safety for ISS applications."

The goal of this study is to investigate the surface composition of Phobos and Deimos and search for any mineralogical absorption signatures that may be present on their surfaces, especially in the LXD spectral range. Prism spectra of Phobos showed significant slope variation at shorter wavelengths (λ <1.3 μm), which indicates surface heterogeneity possibly due to regolith’s composition and grain size, and/or space weathering. Deimos’ prism  spectra  were  found  to  be  consistent  with  the  more  red-sloped  prism  spectra  of  Phobos.  The measured LXD spectra of Deimos revealed evidence of hydration with 3-μm band depths at 2.90 μm of 4–5%. The 3-μm band in Deimos could be attributed to exogenic sources such as solar wind implantation or OH-bearingimpactors, or to an endogenic source and the presence of carbonaceous material on its surface. Phobos’ andDeimos’ prism and LXD spectra, however, show no indications for absorption signatures of mafic silicates (i.e.,pyroxene, olivine), organics nor carbonates."

AGN Luminosity Functions and Helium Reionization at z= 2–7,"Active galactic nuclei (AGN) forming in the early universe are thought to be the pri-mary source of hard ionizing photons contributing to the reionization of intergalactic helium.  However,  the  number  density  and  spectral  properties  of  high-redshift  AGN remain largely unconstrained. In this work, we make use of physically-informed mod-els  calibrated  with  a  wide  variety  of  available  observations  to  provide  estimates  for the role of AGN throughout the Epoch of Reionization. We present AGN luminosity functions in various bands between z= 2 to 7 predicted by the well-established Santa Cruz semi-analytic model, which includes modelling of black hole accretion and AGN feedback. We then combine the predicted AGN populations with a physical spectral model for self-consistent estimates of ionizing photon production rates, which depend on  the  mass  and  accretion  rate  of  the  accreting  supermassive  black  hole.  We  then couple the predicted comoving ionizing emissivity with an analytic model to compute the subsequent reionization history of intergalactic helium and hydrogen. This work demonstrates the potential of coupling physically motivated analytic or semi-analytic techniques to capture multi-scale physical processes across a vast range of scales (here, from AGN accretion disks to cosmological scales). Our physical model predicts an in-trinsic  ionizing  photon  budget  well  above  many  of  the  estimates  in  the  literature, meaning that helium reionization can comfortably be accomplished even with a rel-atively low escape fraction. We also make predictions for the AGN populations that are expected to be detected in future James Webb Space Telescope surveys"

The magnitude of forest damages and the rates and mechanisms of forest recovery following Maria provide important benchmarks for understanding the ecology of extreme events. We used airborne Lidar data acquired before (2017) and after Maria (2018, 2020) to quantify landscape-scale changes in forest structure along a 439-ha elevational gradient (100–800 m) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest. Damages from Maria were widespread, with 73% of the study area losing ≥ 1 m in canopy height (mean = −7.1 m). Taller forests at lower elevations suffered more damage than shorter forests above 600 m. Yet only 13.5% of the study area had canopy heights ≤ 2 m in 2018, a typical threshold for forest gaps, highlighting the importance of damaged trees and advanced regeneration on post-storm forest structure. Heterogeneous patterns of regrowth and recruitment yielded shorter and more open forests by 2020. Nearly 45% of forests experienced initial height loss > 1 m (2017–2018) followed by rapid height gain > 1 m (2018–2020), whereas 21.6% of forests with initial height losses showed little or no height gain, and 17.8% of forests exhibited no height changes larger than ± 1 m in either period. Canopy layers < 10 m tall accounted for most increases in canopy height and fractional cover between 2018 and 2020, with gains split evenly between height growth and lateral crown expansion by surviving individuals. These findings benchmark rates of gap formation, crown expansion, and canopy closure following hurricane damage and highlight the diversity of ecosystem impacts from heterogeneous spatial patterns and vertical stratification of forest regrowth following a major disturbance event."

However, recent space weathering and/or solar heating create ambiguities between the uppermost layer observable by remote-sensing and the pristine material from the parent body. Hayabusa2 remote-sensing observations find that on the asteroid (162173) Ryugu both north and south pole regions preserve the least space-weathered material, which is spectrally blue carbonaceous chondritic material with a 0 – 3% deep 0.7-μm band absorption, indicative of Fe-bearing phyllosilicates . We report that spectrally blue Ryugu’s parent body experienced intensive aqueous alteration and subsequent thermal metamorphism at 570 – 670 K (300 – 400 ˚C), suggesting that Ryugu’s parent body was heated by radioactive decay of short-lived radionuclides possibly because of its early formation 2-2.5 Ma. The samples being brought to Earth by Hayabusa2 will give us our first insights into this epoch in solar system history.

The method predicts the reattachment location using the surface static pressure distribution and requires only a single empirical parameter. The method is based on the well-known Stratford’s flow separation criterion, which results from an approximate solution to the equations of motion within the boundary layer. Because of the large pressure rise, the original Stratford separation criterion is not valid for reattaching flows. In order to apply the Stratford criterion for reattaching flows, the reference location was moved to the pressure drop conditions instead of pressure rise conditions. In addition, the pressure distribution was scaled using a technique that was originally introduced for supersonic base flows. A new empirical parameter was also obtained for the modified Stratford criterion. The method has been tested for 30 different separated flow configurations from the literature. The variety of test cases include subsonic flows, transonic flows, 2D flows, and axisymmetric flows, with experimental as well as high resolution numerical simulation results. The flow reattachment predictions with the new method agree very well with the reported data. The error is less than 5% and typically about 2%. The new method is an extremely simple and a quick way of finding the reattachment location. Given the complexities of the existing experimental techniques for finding the reattachment location, the method easily and quickly provides the flow reattachment location, which could be used to estimate the physical extent of separation bubbles, as a performance index for flow control methods, or to assess the predictive capability of turbulence models."

This means that SCWO can theoretically function as a single step water treatment system.  It performs the functions of both the primary treatment system and the secondary brine drying function to achieve near 100% water recovery.  It can also handle solids so no pretreatment of the feed is required.  A preliminary trade study indicates that SCWO could be competitive with the ISS state of the art if its power consumption could be reduced.  Thermal and mechanical energy recovery system exist that could reduce SCWO energy consumption to a level that is competitive with the state of the art.  In addition, increasing the feed wastewaters organic content by including other wastes, such as feces, could produce a reactor that is thermally self-sustaining.
	There are 5 different types of SCWO reactors.  They are; tubular, tank, impingement, transpiring wall reactors (TWR) and super critical water mixing (SCWM) reactors.  Of these the best suited for NASA missions are the impingement and SCWM reactors.  The impingement reactor is best suited for near term missions because it can treat the low organic content wastewaters such as are expected for initial Lunar and Mars missions and has the ability to remove precipitated inorganic solids.  The SCWM reactor is best suited for longer duration CELSS type missions where high organic content wastewater is available and will resolve solids fouling and corrosion issues.  In addition, these two reactors have a long NASA heritage and have been developed specifically for space flight application.  Tubular reactors suffer from plugging issues which is a safety concern.  Tank reactors will increase in size inversely with gravity, which will trade poorly in Lunar and Mars environments where gravity is reduced.  TWR reactors require high organic content wastewater feed and the SCWM reactor is an optimized version of the TWR for NASA applications.
	It is recommended that in FY 2022 NASA continue to fully evaluate the ability of SCWO to produce potable water and remove inorganics as a solid byproduct.  This should be done using the impingement reactor for near term missions and SCWM for longer duration missions.  NASA should also develop optimized recuperative heat exchangers and pressure recovery devices to reduce power consumption and investigate inclusion of feces and other organic wastes into the wastewater model to increase its organic content and further reduce thermal energy requirements."

In this paper we investigate particle acceleration during the impulsive phase of a coronal jet,  which involves bursty reconnection at a magnetic null point.  A test-particle approach is employed, using electromagnetic fields from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of such a jet.  Protons and electrons are found to be accelerated non-thermally both downwards toward the domain’s lower boundary and the solar photosphere, and outwards along the axis of the coronal jet and into the heliosphere.  A key finding is that a circular ribbon of particle deposition on the photosphere is predicted, with the protons and electrons concentrated in different parts of the ribbon.  Furthermore, the outgoing protons and electrons form two spatially separated beams parallel to the axis of the jet, signatures that may be observable inin-situobservations of the heliosphere."

Phase change processes need to be implemented in the design of various life support systems, sub-critical cryogenic and thermal control systems, taking advantage of the latent heat of phase change so as to significantly increase the heat transfer rate per unit fluid mass. Experimental data are critical to understanding gravitational effects on complex phase change processes using novel materials and working fluids. Experimental data can be acquired by either designing new testing platforms or performing experiments with simulant fluids on   existing   microgravity   platforms.   With   the   acquired   data,   theoretical   flow   physics   models   and numerical  simulations can then be validated for  use under  long-duration microgravity conditions.

The differential intensities of eastward- and westward-traveling protons detected in the South Atlantic Anomaly region were estimated as a function of equatorial pitch angle and drift shell, for six energy bins between80 MeV and 2 GeV. We found that, as a consequence of the strong atmospheric gradient coupled with the large gyro radius in this energy range, the intensities of eastward fluxes exceed those of westward fluxes by a factor of∼10–20. However, the reported directional asymmetry also depends on the sign of the local flux gradient, resulting in more intense westward fluxes beyond the radial distances where the inner belt peaks. PAMELA observations can be used to improve the description of the near-Earth radiation environment at lowest altitudes and highest trapping energies, where current theoretical and empirical models are affected by the largest uncertainties. Unified Astronomy Thesaurus concepts: Cosmic rays(329);Van Allen radiation belts(1758)1. Introduction Low-altitude inner-belt protons are strongly influenced by the density  distribution  of  Earth’s atmosphere,  mostly  through interactions with its neutral constituents, which induce significant flux anisotropies. In prim is, the atmospheric loss cone results in a steep pitch-angle distribution, which becomes narrower for lower drift shells. A further, azimuthal anisotropy originates from finite gyro radius effects at proton energies in excess of a few tens of MeV(Haerendel1962; Lenchek & Singer1962). In fact, for a given spacecraft position, protons with the same pitch angle but different gyro phase—the azimuth angle associated with the gyration motion—have their guiding centers on different drift shells. In particular, protons from the west and from the east gyrate around magnetic field lines located at higher and lower altitudes, respectively. The guiding-center separationΔhincreaseswith increasing energy, so that protons moving eastward will encounter  progressively  lower  drift-averaged  densities,  thus experiencing less atmospheric absorption; the opposite situation will occur for protons traveling westward, resulting in an east–west asymmetry of flux intensities whenΔhbecomes comparable to or larger than the flux scale height(Garmire1963; Heckman &Nakano1963).The trapped-flux anisotropy is a relevant aspect of the modeling of the low Earth orbit(LEO)radiation environment, given the significant engineering implications, especially for The Astrophysical Journal,919:114(6pp), 2021 October 1https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1677© 2021.

These measurements of HCN, CS, CH3OH, H2CO, and HNC (along with continuum emission from dust) probed the inner coma of C/2015 ER61, revealing asymmetric outgassing and discerning parent from daughter/distributed source species. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra, production rates, and parent scale lengths for each molecule and a stringent upper limit for CO. HCN is consistent with direct nucleus release in C/2015 ER61, whereas CS, H2CO, HNC, and potentially CH3OH are associated with distributed sources in the coma. Adopt- ing a Haser model, parent scale lengths determined for H2CO (Lp ∼ 2200 km) and HNC (Lp ∼ 3300 km) are consistent with previous work in comets, whereas significant extended source production (Lp ∼ 2000 km) is indicated for CS, suggesting production from an unknown parent in the coma. The con- tinuum  presents  a point-source  distribution with a flux  density  implying  an excessively large nucleus, inconsistent with other estimates of the nucleus size. It is best explained by the thermal emission of slowly moving outburst ejectas, with total mass 5–8 × 1010 kg. These results demonstrate the power of the ACA for revealing the abundances, spatial distributions, and locations of molecular production for volatiles in moderately bright comets such as C/2015 ER61."

Background: Future astronauts will be expected to self-schedule, yet will not be experts in creating timelines that meet complex constraints inherent to spaceflight operations.
Method: Conducted a within-subject experiment to measure scheduling efficiency, effectiveness, workload and situation awareness while varying scheduling task complexity factors, namely number of constraints and types of constraints.  
Results: Fifteen participants completed various scheduling problems. Performance differences were identified between the independent variables. There was a main effect due to the number of constraints and type of constraint for efficiency, effectiveness, and workload. Significant interactions were observed in situation awareness and workload for certain types of constraints. Results also suggest that a lower number of constraints may be manageable by novice schedulers when compared to scheduling activities without constraints.
Conclusion: Results suggest that novice schedulers performance decreases with high number of constraints and future scheduling aids may have to be targeted to type of constraint.
Application: Knowledge on the effect of scheduling task complexity will help design scheduling systems that will enable self-scheduling for future astronauts. It will also inform other domains that conduct complex scheduling, such as nursing and manufacturing."

Such systems will require replenishing cryogens on-orbit via a cryogenic tanker or propellant depot, and potentially on the lunar and Martian surfaces with the utilization of in-situ resources. Replenishing cryogens on-orbit requires a tank-to-tank transfer which presents challenges due to thermal environments and the absence of gravity. If the transfer process is initiated with the receiving tank empty and at atmospheric temperature, it then must be chilled to cryogenic temperature to enable filling. Likewise, the transfer lines and associated hardware must be prechilled to assure liquid is transferred. Since prechilling results in propellant loss, it is preferred to minimize this process in interest of saving propellant mass. To simplify the operations associated with propellant transfer and explore potential mass savings, NASA has been experimenting with a new methodology which uses a Vented Chill/No-Vent Fill (VC/NVF) approach, and enhances the process using a 3-D printed spray injector augmented with a Thermodynamic Vent System (TVS)."

Concurrent with this, demand for seasonal drought forecasting has risen.  While  there  is  obvious  synergy  between  these  fields,  S2S  meteorological  forecasting  has typically  focused  on  low  resolution  global  models,  while  the  development  of  drought  can  be sensitive  to  the  local  expression  of  weather  anomalies  and  their  interaction  with  local  surface properties  and  processes.  This  suggests  that  downscaling  might  play  an  important  role  in  the application of meteorological S2S forecasts to skillful forecasting of drought.  Here, we apply the Generalized  Analog  Regression  Downscaling  (GARD)  algorithm  to  downscale  meteorological hindcasts from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) global S2S forecast system. Downscaled meteorological fields are then applied to drive offline simulations with the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) to forecast United States Drought Monitor (USDM) style drought indicators derived from simulated surface hydrology variables. We compare the representation of drought  in  these  downscaled  hindcasts  to  hindcasts  that  are  not  downscaled,  using  the  North  American  Land  Data  Assimilation  System  Phase  2  (NLDAS-2)  dataset  as  an  observational  reference.  We  find  that  downscaling  using  GARD  improves  hindcasts  of  temperature  and  temperature  anomalies,  but  the  results  for  precipitation  are  mixed  and  generally  small.  Overall,  GARD downscaling led to improved hindcast skill for total drought across the Contiguous United States (CONUS), and improvements were greatest for extreme (D3) and exceptional (D4) drought categories."

We also find a BCG offset of∼950 km/s from the mean velocity of the cluster, anda discrepancy between the SZ mass, X-ray mass, and dynamical mass (MX,500andMSZ,500lies>3σaway fromMdyn,500), showing that J0019 is a merging cluster and probably in a post-merging phase."

For this assessment, tantalum capacitors are typically subjected to reliability testing at temperatures and voltages exceeding their specified values, and the failure rate (FR) — or the probability of failure during use conditions — is calculated based on voltage and temperature acceleration factors. In this work, various types and lots of polymer tantalum capacitors have been tested at highly accelerated life test (HALT) conditions and the acceleration factors have been determined using different techniques. It has been shown that the behavior of capacitors under HALT conditions can be described based on the time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) model, which explains the presence of infant mortality (IM) and wear-out failures using the same failure mechanisms and allows for an assessment of the acceleration factors. The difference in acceleration factors obtained using exponential and power models is discussed. Analysis shows that with proper derating, screening, and qualification testing, the reliability of frameless Hi-Rel COTS polymer tantalum capacitors is adequate for space missions."

In this work, BME feedthrough capacitors compliant with AEC-Q200 requirements have been evaluated, screened and qualified for a space project.  Evaluation included analysis of the effect of post-soldering thermal shocks, temperature dependencies of leakage currents, distribution of breakdown voltages, assessments of high-current capability, and thermal resistance of the parts.  The parts have been screened and qualified at conditions close to the military requirements for ceramic capacitors.  No failures were detected during screening including burning-in, but two samples failed during monitored 2000 hour life testing at 125C and two times rated voltage.  Failure analysis revealed manufacturing defects that required additional analysis of screening and qualification test conditions.  Highly accelerated life testing (HALT) has been carried out to assess reliability acceleration factors and the probability of failure at the use conditions.  An approach to selection of adequate burning-in and life test conditions is discussed."

CHF measurements were made in a rectangular channel having a 2.5 mm by 5 mm cross-section and a 114.6-mm long heated segment.  Both single-sided and double-sided heating were tested in vertical upflow in Earth gravity for a variety of inlet conditions.  The inlet subcooling was varied in the range of 0.4 – 32.0°C and encompassed both near-saturated and highly subcooled conditions.  Experimental trends and high-speed video records were investigated to better understand the mechanism of CHF.  Overall trends show CHF increases as flow rate and/or inlet subcooling are increased.  Flow features from the events around CHF justify the applicability of the Interfacial Lift-off Model and the determination of limiting criteria for its application.  The present experimental data are combined with prior databases for various flow orientations with respect to Earth gravity and microgravity data collected on parabolic flights.  Predictions are made using the Interfacial Lift-off Model for this consolidated subcooled-inlet FBCE-CHF database.  A heat utility ratio was included in the model to capture the effects of subcooling and corresponding thermodynamic non-equilibrium.  An overall mean absolute error of 19.04% indicates good predictive capability of the model for both heating configurations, different gravity environments, and a wide range of inlet subcooling."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship of crewmember heart rate (HR) and metabolic rate (MR) during EVA operations to develop a predictive linear model. HR and MR data was collected from 132 EVAs from Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) missions. MR was collected every 2-min from portable life support system delta oxygen decay, while HR was collected every 20-sec via electrocardiogram. HR was down sampled to every 2-min to match MR during EVA for evaluation. Further, a new metric was observed from direct relations between metabolic rate with HR over EVA time (MR/HR) measured as a BTU/beat. A range of BTU/beat was collected as a conversion scale between MR and HR at different EVA workloads categorized by increased MR. Both HR and MR values were observed to decrease through the duration of EVA. Similarly, HR and MR slopes decreased at start of EVA compared to end of EVA. MR/HR values were used to predict MR from HR over the entire duration of EVA with root mean square error less than 200 BTU/Hr. Additionally, MR was predicted based on HR values during EVA via a calculated simple linear regression. A regression equation was found for each EVA drawing relations between HR and MR (F (2923.84) and P<0.0001) with an R(sup 2) value of 0.402. Individual crew regressions improved prediction and R(sup 2) to greater than 0.82. Two models are presented to determine metabolic rate from heart rate during EVA. Results draw correlations for heart rate and metabolic rate fluctuations during EVA for individualized crew predictions during future operations. The linear models correlate to Apollo prediction data during historic EVAs."

Furthermore, these models often account for only a subset of the relevant transition mechanisms and/or cannot accurately predict the sensitivity of those mechanisms to the changes in significant flow parameters. A preceding investigation had targeted the assessment of the transport-equation-based transition models in NASA's OVERFLOW 2.3b solver, namely, the amplification factor transport (AFT-2017b) equation model coupled with the Spalart-Allmaras RANS model and the Langtry-Menter transition models (LM2009 without crossflow effects and LM2015 including the modeling of crossflow transition) implemented with Menter’s shear-stress transport equation (SST2003) RANS model. Comparisons with recent measurements at transonic freestream conditions on the Common Research Model with Natural Laminar Flow (CRM-NLF) reinforced our earlier finding that all three of the above models significantly underpredict the reported extent of the laminar flow region over the entire span of the wing, regardless of the dominant instability mechanism(s) underlying the onset of the transition process. The underprediction of the laminar flow extent was attributed to the failure of the above models in accounting for the stabilizing effect of compressibility on the amplification of Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities. Based on previous linear stability studies related to compressibility effects, the present work proposes modifications to the two classes of transition models that reduce to the original form of each model at low subsonic speeds and do not require any nonlocal flow information or additional transport equation(s). The modifications are shown to significantly improve the predicted laminar extent of the flow and compare well against the data from the CRM-NLF experiment. Additionally, a previous assessment of transition prediction based on the dual, nonparallel <i>N</i>-factor method in conjunction with linear parabolized stability equations (PSE) is extended to additional angles of attack to provide the first comprehensive assessment of transition models based on nonparallel disturbance amplification over the CRM-NLF. In general, the transition criterion based on the dual, nonparallel N-factor method with <i>N<sub>TS</sub> = N<sub>CF</sub></i> = 6 is reasonably successful at correlating with the measured transition fronts at R<i><sub>eMAC</i></sub> = 15 million for all angles of attack investigated herein and provides additional validation of the improved predictions from the compressibility-corrected transition models."

Hogue et al. (2012). Launch and landing pads are necessary to mitigate risks to lander/ascent vehicles, surface assets, and orbital assets from rocket plume ejected regolith. At this time, all launching and landing on the lunar surface will be on unprepared surface sites. Though this has been a successful approach for Apollo and other uncrewed missions, significant risks exist for the Artemis Program due to the increased thrust of the vehicles, presence of co-located assets, and potential surface level requirements for tall vehicles. This project developed a thermoset polymer–regolith composite material for use as a launch and landing pad. Test articles were prepared at 20% and 11% polymer mass percent (wt%) and tested under hot fire conditions that simulated large vehicle lunar launch/landing conditions. A minimum polymer wt% of 9% was achieved and both samples successfully mitigated regolith ejecta from plume effects. A concept for emplacing launch/landing pads was successfully tested in laboratory environments using a screw and barrel approach to mixing, conveying and depositing materials. It is recommended that materials and systems be developed to TRL 6 for a small-scale lunar demonstration of emplacement of a launch/landing pad via a Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) mission to support the Artemis Program."

The model geometry and conditions are selected to match experiments conducted in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Mach 6 Ludwieg Tube. Five nosetips of interest were selected for the computational studies herein: two sharp ogives, two blunt ogives, and one hemispherical nosetip. Computations are performed at a freestream Reynolds number of 7.01 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>. Each sharp and blunt tip ogives had a 14 and 28 degree version for the tip angles. A cylindrical section follows the nosetip, resulting in a meter long model such as in the experiments. The laminar flow solutions are analyzed. The boundary-layer-edge properties and the velocity and temperature profiles are compared across streamwise locations aft of the ogive-cylinder junction. The blunt nosetips induce an entropy layer that envelopes the boundary-layer profiles. Modal stability analysis identifies most amplified frequencies corresponding to Mack’s second modes that agree with experimental results for the sharp tips. Similar to the experimental measurements based on wall-mounted pressure sensors, no unstable modes are found for the blunt models. Nonmodal analysis revealed a broadband set of disturbances present for the blunter tips, in agreement with experimental observations. Flow perturbation contours of most amplified planar and oblique disturbances are shown to qualitatively match wind tunnel Schlieren images, with a switch from rope-like to elongated structures, i.e., from high frequency Mack’s second modes to low frequency Mack’s first modes, as the nosetip angle is increased for the sharp tip, and from boundary-layer to entropy-layer disturbances as the bluntness is increased."

We build the metric as an analytical superposition of two Kerr metrics in harmonic coordinates, where we transform each black hole term with time-dependent boosts describing an inspiral trajectory. The velocities and trajectories of the boost are obtained by solving the post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion at 3.5 PN order. We analyze the spacetime scalars of the new metric and we show that it is an accurate approximation of Einstein’s field equations in vacuum for a BBH system in the inspiral regime. Furthermore, to prove the effectiveness of our approach, we test the metric in the context of a 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulation of accreting minidisks around the black holes. We compare our results with a previous well-tested spacetime construction based on the asymptotic matching method. We conclude that our new spacetime is well-suited for long-term GRMHD simulations of spinning binary black holes on their way to the merger."

The last decade has seen significant progress in the development of DAA requirements, spearheaded by RTCA Special Committee 228 (SC228) and subsequently by other standards organizations such as EUROCAE and ASTM. SC-228’s development of DAA requirements assumes the UAS follows instrument flight rules (IFR) and has a remote pilot or operator in the loop. As of the publication of this document, the SC-228’s latest Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for DAA, versioned as DO-365B [1], DAA systems use onboard and/or ground surveillance systems to detect traffic. The surveillance systems must detect both cooperative and non-cooperative air traffic. Cooperative traffic are vehicles that have a broadcasting transponder, while non-cooperative traffic do not, and so must be detected via radar or other sensors. A DAA system’s alerting and guidance functions alert the pilot/operator in the loop of potential hazards, such as intruder aircraft, and provide maneuver solutions which help the pilot/operator avoid or mitigate observed hazards. A UAS pilot is expected to coordinate with air traffic control (ATC) before
executing a conflict avoidance maneuver if the type of alert is not urgent enough to require an immediate maneuver."

By further exploring the relationships of aerosol concentrations and their optical properties using ground observations, the accuracies of these products can be improved. Here, we analyzed collocated observations of surface mass concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC), as well as columnar aerosol optical properties from a sky radiometer and aerosol extinction profiles obtained by multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS), during the 2019–2020 period. We focused the analyses on a daily scale, emphasizing the role of the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region. Generally, the correlation between the AOD of the fine fraction (i.e., fAOD) and the PM2.5 surface concentration was moderately strong, regardless of considerations of boundary layer humidity and altitude. In contrast, the fAOD of the partial column below 1 km, which was obtained by combining sky radiometer and MAX-DOAS retrievals, better reproduced the variability of the PM2.5 and resulted in a linear relationship. In the same manner, we demonstrated that the absorption AOD of the fine fraction (fAAOD) of the partial column was related to the variability of the BC concentration. Analogous analyses based on aerosol products from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) confirmed these findings and highlighted the importance of the shape of the aerosol profile. Overall, our results indicated a remarkable consistency among the retrieved datasets, and between the datasets and MERRA-2 products. These results confirmed the well-known sensitivity to aerosol absorption in the UV spectral region; they also highlighted the efficacy of combined MAX-DOAS and sky radiometer observations."

The orbital dynamics were highly perturbed by various sources, most notably solar radiation pressure, which degraded accuracy of long term predictions of the spacecraft’s location in orbit. Generally, the Navigation team had to solve three separate issues: correcting a perturbed orbit, changing to a different orbit, or phasing the or bitto place the spacecraft at a specific location at a specific time. The team composed a common framework using up to two maneuvers that could solve all of these problems using an identical schedule that allowed for consistent planning long before the final trajectory could be designed. This orbit trim strategy was successfully used for the first time in the Orbital B phase of the mission to maximize the duration of usable observing geometry in  a  time-variable  orbit with  strict  operational  limits.  It  was  used  an  additional  3  times throughout the mission to adjust and/or change the orbit, most notably altering the orbit in the weeks prior to the successful Touch-And-Go (TAG)sample collection attempt. This same strategy was used to phase the orbit a total 10 times in preparation for each of the science sorties over potential sample sites, the TAG Rehearsals, and TAG. The trim strategy was demonstrated to be robust and performed exceptionally well in all aspects, which proved critical to a successful sample collection."

A substantial amount of mission resources across multiple subsystems and institutions is required to ensure that the OpNav data are successfully acquired. The KinetX OpNav team, part of the Flight Dynamics System (FDS), is responsible for performing required analysis to develop the OpNav operations plans; requesting, reviewing and verifying the plans; and ultimately using the image data for critical navigation operations. The FDS team, responsible for the mission navigation, is operated by KinetX Aerospace with management and operations support from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. The Science Processing and Operations Center (SPOC), located at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, is responsible for generating the planning products for all science and most OpNav data. These plans are integrated into the spacecraft sequences, tested, and commanded by the Mission Support Area (MSA) at Lockheed Martin Space. To ensure mission-critical navigation image data are successfully acquired, the plan is developed through a waterfall of planning cycles over the course of 3 months prior to onboard plan execution. During the initial strategic planning for a mission phase, detailed analysis is performed by the OpNav team to conceptualize the concept of operations (ConOps) for image data collection. This phase OpNav Narrative is included along with other strategic planning documents for the key ground segment stakeholders to review and provide feedback. The detailed OpNav plans get defined in the tactical planning cycle, which spans 8 to 3 weeks before the week-long integrated sequence is executed on-board the spacecraft. During the tactical cycle, the initial OpNav Request is submitted along with the science requests, kicking off development of the science and OpNav plans. Once the initial plan is drafted, interfaces are exercised so that the plan can be reviewed and iterated, if necessary. A rigorous schedule is followed by the planning teams during the implementation cycle, spanning the last 18 days before uplink, to ensure all the necessary integration, testing, and reviewing can occur on time. The development of the OpNav planning ConOps, including responsibilities, interfaces, timelines, and procedures, took extensive collaboration across mission elements and institutions. The process was robust throughout the 137 weeks of continuous Optical Navigation Operations at Bennu, which concluded on April 9th, 2021."

Similar to terminal area operations for traditional aviation, operations involving HDVs will need to be highly structured while also remaining resilient to the various contingencies that can happen in that environment. The role of the FM is consistent with an “m:N” architecture, where “m” number of operators cooperatively manage “N” number of vehicles (where “N” is always larger than “m”). In such a paradigm it is critical to provide the operator with the tools and information necessary to manage their fleet safely and navigate the known pitfalls with highly automated, complex systems (e.g., brittleness, insufficient situation awareness, skill degradation). As the field of m:N has expanded as an area of study, a set of higher-level automation concepts have emerged—namely “plays,” “working agreements,” and “human-autonomy teaming” (HAT)—that could support operators in this new role."

Vibrations caused by GWs are expected to be several orders of magnitude weaker than what the instrument was designed to observe.

At high levels, L. polyedra can cause marine life mortality, food-borne illness, and respiratory-related health risks in humans. In partnership with the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Southwest Fisheries Science Center, the California Department of Public Health, and the University of California San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, this project utilized satellite imagery to visualize and analyze spatiotemporal trends of historical red tide events associated with L. polyedra. Using the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership’s (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Aqua’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Global Change Observation Mission – Climate (GCOM-C) Second Generation Global Imager (SGLI), the team assessed the validity of using multiple sensors in detecting chlorophyll-a as a proxy for dinoflagellate dominated-algal blooms.

Three variogram models (exponential, Gaussian, and spherical) are compared in this study. According to the cross-validation results, the kriging-estimated freeboards show correlation coefficients of 0.56–0.57, root mean square error (RMSE) of ~0.12 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) of ~0.07 m with the actual ATL10 freeboard measurements. In addition, the estimated errors of the kriging interpolation are low in autumn and high in winter to spring, and low in southern regions and high in northern regions of the Ross Sea. The effective ranges of the variograms are 5–10 km and the results from the three variogram models do not show significant differences with each other. The southwest (SW) sector of the Ross Sea shows low and consistent freeboard over the entire year because of the frequent opening of wide polynya areas generating new ice in this sector. However, the southeast (SE) sector shows large variations in freeboard, which demonstrates the advection of thick multiyear ice from the Amundsen Sea into the Ross Sea. Thus, this kriging-based interpolation of ICESat-2 freeboard can be used in the future to estimate accurate sea ice production over the Ross Sea by incorporating other remote sensing data."

dramatic declines in abundance during the past few decades, particularly in the central and
western Aleutian Islands. Both stocks have continued to decline in recent years, thus are a high
priority for routine monitoring.

NOAA’s Marine Mammal laboratory (MML) has conducted aerial surveys of marine mammals throughout coastal Alaska to monitor trends in population abundance and distribution for more than 20 years. These surveys have typically been conducted from a twinengine aircraft, such as a DHC-6 Twin Otter, operated by NOAA pilots and crewmembers. Aerial surveys in the Aleutian Islands present significant challenges and higher risks due to their remoteness, rugged terrain, and extreme weather. To evaluate the feasibility of transitioning from manned to unmanned aerial surveys in this region, thereby reducing risks to NOAA personnel and high-value aircraft, we propose to conduct test survey flights in the Near Islands of Alaska using a medium-sized, fixed-wing UAV (NASA’s SIERRA-B aircraft) with a nadir-aimed imaging payload.

Survey flights are planned to be conducted during daylight hours on days with VFR
conditions and less than ~20 knot winds at altitudes of 800-1200 feet. Survey imagery, including
thermal video and high-resolution color photos, would be collected at known Steller sea lion
and harbor seal sites along the coastlines of Shemya, Nizki, Alaid, Agattu, and Attu Islands. The
planning team will request approval and support from the US Air Force to conduct this project
at Eareckson Air Station (Shemya Island, AK) during the month of September 2022 when
weather conditions in the western Aleutian Islands are expected to be optimal."

variability and has frequently been applied for the determination of global mass rates to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activity on global freshwater availability and land ice evolution. However, its relatively coarse spatial resolution of ∼300-500 km at monthly intervals precludes its direct use to measure mass changes in smaller drainage basins and individual glacier systems. We present a new global high resolution mascon product that improves spatial resolution and signal recovery by estimating trends directly from more than 16 years of Level 1B GRACE and GRACE-FO data. We compare this product to independent gravimetry spherical harmonic trend estimates and to ice sheet mass rates derived from ICESat and ICESat-2 laser altimetry. We demonstrate enhanced global signal recovery and improved agreement with ICESat/ ICESat-2 and discuss likely causes for the remaining discrepancies between the gravimetry and laser altimetry solutions."

We used multitemporal high-resolution remote sensing optical imagery to quantify the extent and intensity of forest degradation associated with charcoal production and its impact on forest carbon stocks for the main supplying area of an African capital. This analysis documents the advance of forest degradation and quantifies its aboveground biomass removals over a seven-year period, registering that, between 2013 and 2016, the average annual area under charcoal production was 103 sq.km and the annual aboveground biomass removals reached 1081 000 (SD = 2461) Mg. Kiln densities in the study area rose to 2 kilns-ha, with an average of 90.7 Mg ha^(−1) of extracted aboveground biomass. Charcoal production was responsible for the degradation of 55.5% of the mopane woodlands in the study area between 2013 and 2019. We estimated post-disturbance recovery times using an ecosystem model calibrated for the study area. The simulations showed that recovery times could require up to 150 years for current aboveground biomass extraction rates. The results of the remote sensing analysis and the simulations of the ecosystem model corroborate the unsustainability of the present patterns of charcoal production. The detailed characterization of the spatial and temporal patterns of charcoal production was combined with household survey information to quantify the impact of the urban energy demand of the Maputo urban area on forest carbon stocks. The analysis shows that Maputo charcoal demand was responsible for the annual degradation of up to 175.3 sq.km and that the contribution of the study area to this demand fluctuated between 75% and 33% over the study period. The extent, advance pace and distance from urban centers documented in this study support the idea that forest degradation from charcoal production cannot merely be considered a peri-urban process. The intensity of the aboveground biomass (AGB) removals and its contribution to forest carbon stocks changes is significant at the national and regional levels."

The material model was developed for execution in the commercially available nonlinear, explicit transient dynamic finite element code, LS-DYNA®.  This material model incorporates three sub-models: deformation, damage, and failure.  In addition, the model accounts for strain rate and temperature effects and relies heavily on the input of tabulated material response data.  The model is designated *MAT_COMPOSITE_TABULATED_PLASTICITY_DAMAGE, or *MAT_213.  Initially, *MAT_213 was developed for use with solid elements only; however, a thin shell element formulation for *MAT_213 has been adapted recently.  The objective of this project was to find a suitable modeling example to investigate the capabilities and performance of *MAT_213.  In 2012, two composite energy absorbers were designed and evaluated at NASA Langley Research Center through multi-level testing and simulation.  The first was a conical-shaped energy absorber, designated the conusoid, which consisted of four layers of hybrid carbon-Kevlar® plain-weave fabric oriented at [+45°/-45°/-45°/+45°] with respect to the vertical direction.  The second was a sinusoidal-shaped energy absorber, designated the sinusoid, which consisted of hybrid carbon-Kevlar® plain-weave fabric face sheets, two layers for each face sheet oriented at ±45° with respect to the vertical direction, and a closed-cell ELFOAM® P200 polyisocyanurate foam core.  Finite element models were developed of the energy absorbers and simulations were performed using LS-DYNA®.  In this paper, the development of a *MAT_213 model of a hybrid carbon-Kevlar® plain-weave fabric is presented.  Next, comparisons with material characterization tests are presented.  Then, test-analysis results are documented for each energy absorber as comparisons of time-history responses, as well as predicted and experimental structural deformations and progressive damage under impact loading using the *MAT_213 material model.  Since a prior *MAT_58, or *MAT_LAMINATED_COMPOSITE_FABRIC material model was used in previous simulations of the energy absorbers, comparisons are made between *MAT_58 and *MAT_213 model predictions with test data.  Finally, the paper includes a comprehensive list of “lessons learned,” in which a series of parametric studies are documented that were performed to investigate specific issues related to the material model.  These “lessons learned” are included in hopes that they may help future *MAT_213 users."

This is the first systematic investigation of alarge sample of type I X-ray bursts from Aql X-1 with improved sensitivity at low energies. We detect 22 X-ray bursts includingtwo short recurrence burst events in which the separation was only 451 s and 496 s. We perform time resolved spectroscopy of thebursts using the fixed and scaled background (fa method) approaches. We show that the use of a scaling factor to the pre-burstemission is the statistically preferred model in about 68% of all the spectra compared to the fixed background approach. Typically the fa values are clustered around 1–3, but can reach up to 11 in a burst where photospheric radius expansion is observed. Such fa values indicate a very significant increase in the pre-burst emission especially at around the peak flux moments of the bursts.We show that the use of the fa factor alters the best fit spectral parameters of the burst emission. Finally, we employed a reflectionmodel instead of scaling the pre-burst emission. We show that reflection models also do fit the spectra and improve the goodnessof the fits. In all cases we see that the disc is highly ionized by the burst emission and the fraction of the reprocessed emission tothe incident burst flux is typically clustered around 20%"

Both absorption and emission components showed strong variations. The variation of the absorption component as the O5 star was occulted by the wind-collision region (WCR) sets a tight constraint on its geometry. While the sightline to the O5 star traversed the WCR, the strength and breadth of the absorption component varied significantly on time-scales of days. An emission subpeak was observed on all our profiles. The variation of its radial velocity with orbital phase was shown to be consistent with formation in the WCR as it swung round the stars in their orbit. Modelling the profile gives a measure of the extent of the subpeak-forming region. In the phase range 0.93–0.99, the flux in the subpeak increased steadily, approximately inversely proportionally to the stellar separation, indicating that the shocked gas in the WCR where the line was formed was adiabatic. After periastron, the subpeak flux was anomalously strong and varied rapidly, suggesting formation in clumps downstream in the WCR. For most of the time, its flux exceeded the 2–10-keV X-ray emission, showing it to be a significant coolant of the shocked wind."

However, regulation is dependent on a sparse network of air quality monitoring stations and insufficient ground data. This study utilizes long-term observations of aerosols and trace gases to characterize and rank the air pollution scenarios and pollution characteristics of 80 selected cities in Pakistan. Datasets used include (1) the Aqua and Terra (AquaTerra) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Level 2 Collection 6.1 merged Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval products; (2) the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) reanalysis PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 data; (3) the  MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2)  reanalysis PM2.5 data, (4) the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) tropospheric vertical column  density (TVCD) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and VCD of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the Planetary  Boundary Layer (PBL), (5) the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Nighttime Lights data, (6) MODIS Collection 6 Version 2 global monthly fire location data (MCD14ML), (7) population density, (8) MODIS Level 3 Collection 6 land cover types, (9) AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) Version 3 Level 2.0 data, and (10) ground-based PM2.5 concentrations from air quality monitoring stations. Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analyses were performed by integrating with ground-based PM2.5 concentrations and the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) air parcel back trajectories to identify potential pollution source areas which are responsible for extreme air pollution in Pakistan. Results show that the ranking of the top polluted cities depends on the type of pollutant considered and the metric used. For example, Jhang, Multan, and Vehari were characterized as the top three polluted cities in Pakistan when considering AquaTerra DTB AOD products; for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 Lahore, Gujranwala, and Okara were the top three; for tropospheric NO2 VCD Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad and for PBL SO2 VCD Lahore, Mirpur, and Gujranwala. The results demonstrate that Pakistan’s entire population has been exposed to high PM2.5 concentrations for many years, with a mean annual value of 54.7 μg/cu. m, over all Pakistan from 2003 to 2020. This value exceeds Pakistan’s National Environmental Quality Standards (Pak-NEQS, i.e., <15 μg/cu. m annual mean) for ambient air defined by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) as well as the WHO Interim Target-1 (i.e., mean annual PM2.5 <35 μg/cu. m). The spatial analyses of the concentrations of aerosols and trace gases in terms of population density, nighttime lights, land cover types, and fire location data, and the PSCF analysis indicate that Pakistan’s air quality is strongly affected by anthropogenic sources inside of Pakistan, with contributions from surrounding countries. Statistically significant positive (increasing) trends in PM1, PM2.5, PM10, tropospheric NO2 VCD, and SO2 VCD were observed in ~89%, ~67%, ~48%, 91%, and ~88% of the Pakistani cities (80 cities), respectively. This comprehensive analysis of aerosol and trace gas levels, their characteristics in spatio-temporal domains, and their trends over Pakistan, is the first of its kind. Results will be helpful to the Ministry of Climate Change (Government of Pakistan), Pak-EPA, SUPARCO (Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission), policymakers, and the local research community to mitigate air pollution and its effects on human health."

Avoid Mistakes in Microbial Biomanufacturing in Support of Human Near-to-Deep-Space Exploration,"In this whitepaper, we call for the concept of biomanufacturing to be expanded and widely adopted as a support function of human Space-travel. To demonstrate the impact and value of this strategy, we identify the specific offworld scenarios where the concept is most applicable, as well as the vital inventories that can be made available thereby. This will serve to increase capabilities of human operations beyond Earth-orbit and allow for extended mission design through greater autonomy while minimizing risks through redundancy. To this end, we sketch the potential routes and systems to arrive at these goals, in the form of specialized microbial cell factories that can most meaningfully leverage the resources available along the journey. The strategic vision presented here relies heavily on Synthetic Biology as it integrates with major plans for In Situ Resource Utilization and highlights applications that engineered biology is uniquely suited to address. We finish by advocating for the research and development investments that need to be made in order to significantly increase readiness of these technologies over the coming decade. This dovetails with current efforts to return humans to the Moon with Mars on the horizon. Besides ensuring the feasibility and sustainability of crewed Space exploration and habitation, the advancement of these technologies may spawn a new scalable microgravity-based biotechnology industry that contributes to the creation of a circular economy on Earth."

Monitoring and measuring the magnitude of flood events in a timely manner and assessing the subsequent crop damages accurately are precursors in minimizing detrimental consequences that could potentially lead to a global food security crisis. Traditional gauge-based measurements with sophisticated hydrological models are capable of monitoring flood events precisely but limited within the smaller spatial extent, time-consuming, and costly. In recent decades, advancement in airborne- and satellite-based remote sensing technologies offering products at a daily global spatial extent with various spectral resolution helps address the shortcomings of the traditional in situ approaches in flood monitoring. Furthermore, the methods such as classification and band ratioing using remote sensing products are simple and effective in assessing flood-induced agricultural damages. The combination of remote sensing products and geographic information systems along with the current development in web mapping, users now can get near real-time flood monitoring and crop damage assessments, albeit dependent upon the quality of available data. A case study to quantify the impact of the 2011 Missouri Mississippi River flooding on the surrounding cornfield was performed through a regression model. The model was trained using historical daily NDVI and corn yield across Nebraska and Missouri, and the overall accuracy in estimating corn yield was about 90%. The method implemented in this localized case study could be extended at a larger geographical scale."

To fill in gaps, and to improve land to ocean AOD continuity, we developed a coastal water retrieval algorithm at a spatial resolution of 1 km (CW-1km). CW-1km relies on observed top-of-atmosphere reflectance at 2.1 μm (ρ2.1), both to derive AOD and to perform a spatial variation test that enhances the existing DT masks for clouds and land. We show that the CW-1km improves spatial continuity of AOD between land, coast, and open ocean, while also increasing AOD product availability by 47.0%. Comparing with 15 years of marine aerosol network measurements, CW-1km AODs are validated to have a normalized mean bias of 1.0%, which is much smaller than 17.6% for the original DT product."

However, the magnitude of this DRE remains highly uncertain because our understanding of the radiative properties, quantitatively represented by the optical depth of dust, especially information on the TIR, remains limited. This study presents a simple approach to retrieve the thermal infrared dust aerosol optical depth (DAODTIR) over oceans during nighttime using the observations from the Infrared Imaging Radiometer (IIR) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard CALIPSO. For each cloud-free dust-laden profile identified by the IIR-CALIOP observation, a Lookup-Table (LUT) of the 10.6 μm IIR band brightness temperatures difference (dBT) under different DAODTIR with respect to their dust-free BTs is constructed based on the CALIOP retrieved dust vertical profile and pre-assumed dust scattering properties using a fast radiative transfer model. Then the DAODTIR is retrieved by projecting the IIR-observed dBT on the LUT. Sensitivity studies show that the DAODTIR retrieval at 10.6 μm is more susceptible to the dust particle size distribution (PSD) assumption than dust refractive indices. To estimate the uncertainty caused by PSD assumption, two DAODTIR retrieval products, one based on the dust PSD from the AERONET at Cape Verde and the other on an in situ measured PSD from the recent Fennec campaign, are provided. The retrieval uncertainty is mainly contributed by the BT difference between the observation and simulation using auxiliary atmospheric data. The climatology of the retrieval from 2013 to 2019 shows confident spatiotemporal variations of DAODTIR with the global-averaged value of 0.006 and 0.008 based on different pre-assumed dust PSDs. Climatological results agree reasonably well with two independent DAODTIR retrieval products based on the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) over the active dust transport regions, such as North and Tropical Atlantic (r = 0.904 and 0.819) and Indian Ocean (r = 0.832). The seasonal and interannual variation is also well-compared (r = 0.758) with AERONET coarse-mode AOD at 97 selected sites. The synergic CALIOP observation allows the retrieved DAODTIR to directly compare with the extrapolated DAODTIR from DAOD in visible (i.e., 532 nm), which helps evaluate the observational constraints on DAODTIR. This study offers a unique prospect of collocating active lidar and passive IR observations for retrieving dust DAODTIR."

The five planets were identified from the full-frame images and were confirmed through a series of photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations by the TESS Follow-up Observing Program Working Group. The planets are all Jovian size (RP=1.01–1.77RJ) and have masses that range from 0.85 to 6.33MJ. The host stars of these systems have F and G spectral types (5595Teff 6460 K)and are all relatively bright (9.5<V<10.8, 8.2<K<9.3), making them well suited for future detailed characterization efforts. Three of the systems in our sample (TOI-640 b, TOI-1333 b, and TOI-1601 b) orbit subgiant host stars (logg<4.1). TOI-640 b is one of only three known hot Jupiters to have a highly inflated radius (RP>1.7RJ, possibly a result of its host star’s evolution) and resides on an orbit with a period longer than 5 days. TOI-628 b is the most massive, hot Jupiter discovered to date by TESS with a measured mass of-+6.310.300.28MJ and a statistically significant, nonzero orbital eccentricity of e=-+0.0740.0220.021. This planet would not have had enough time to circularize through tidal forces from our analysis, suggesting that it might be remnant eccentricity from its migration. The longest-period planet in this sample, TOI-1478 b (P=10.18 days), is a warm Jupiter in a circular orbit around a near-solar analog. NASA’s TESS mission is continuing to increase the sample of well-characterized hot and warm Jupiters, complementing its primary mission goals."

In the millimeter and FUV, this flare is the brightest ever detected, brightening by a factor of>1000 and>14,000 as seen by ALMA and HST, respectively. The millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other closely during the flare, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to constrain the high-energy radiation environment of exoplanets. Surprisingly, optical emission associated with the event peaks at a much lower level with a time delay. The initial burst has an extremely short duration, lasting for<10 s. Taken together with the growing sample of millimeter M dwarf flares, this event suggests that millimeter emission is actually common during stellar flares and often originates from short burst-like events."

TOI-2076  is a nearby (41.9 pc) multiplanetary system orbiting a young (204 ± 50 Myr), bright (K = 7.115 in TIC v8.1) start. TOI-1807 hosts a single transiting planet and is similarly nearby (42.58 pc), similarly young (180 ± 40 Myr ), and bright. Both targets exhibit significant, periodic variability due to starspots, characteristic of their young ages. Using photometric data collected by TESS  we identify three transiting planets around TOI-2076  with radii of Rb = 3.3 ± 0.04 R⊕, Rc = 4.4 ± 0.05 R⊕, and Rd = 4.1 ± 0.07 R⊕. Planet TOI-2076b  has a period of Pb = 10.356 days. For both TOI-2076c and d, TESS  observed only two transits, separated by a 2 yr interval in which no data were collected, preventing a unique period determination. A range of long periods (<17 days) are consistent with the data. We identify a short-period planet around TOI-1807 with a radius of Rb = 1.8 ± 0.04 R⊕ and a period of Pb = 0.549 days. Their close proximity, and bright, cool host stars, and young ages make these planets excellent candidates for follow up. TOI-1807b  is one of the best-known small (R < 2 ${R}_{\oplus }$) planets for characterization via eclipse spectroscopy and phase curves with JWST. TOI-1807b  is the youngest ultra-short-period planet discovered to date, providing valuable constraints on formation timescales of short-period planets. Given the rarity of young planets, particularly in multiple-planet systems, these planets present an unprecedented opportunity to study and compare exoplanet formation, and young planet atmospheres, at a crucial transition age for formation theory."

luminescence for organics and chemicals (SHERLOC) instrument onboard NASA’s Perseverance Rover. SHERLOC utilizes
deep ultraviolet Raman and fluorescence (DUV R/F) spectroscopy to enable analysis of samples from the Martian surface.
SHERLOC employs a 248.6 nm deep ultraviolet laser to generate Raman-scattered photons and native fluorescence
emission photons from near-surface material to detect and classify chemical and mineralogical compositions. The collected
photons are focused on a charge-coupled device and the data are returned to Earth for analysis. The compact DUV R/F
spectrometer has a spectral range from 249.9 nm to 353.6 nm (200 cm1 to 12, 000 cm1) (with a spectral resolution of
0.296 nm (40 cm1)). The compact spectrometer uses a custom design to project a high-resolution Raman spectrum and
a low-resolution fluorescence spectrum on a single charge-coupled device. The natural spectral separation enabled by
deep ultraviolet excitation enables wavelength separation of the Raman/fluorescence spectra. The SHERLOC spectrometer
was designed to optimize the resolution of the Raman spectral region and the wavelength range of the fluorescence
region. The resulting illumination on the charge-coupled device is curved, requiring a segmented, nonlinear wavelength
calibration in order to understand the mineralogy and chemistry of Martian materials."

The impact of landslides triggered by rainfall is likely to be modulated by the strength of El Nino, but the nature of this connection and the places where it is most relevant remains unconstrained. Here we combine new satellite rainfall data with a global landslide exposure model to show that El Nino has far-reaching effects on landslide impacts to people and infrastructure. We find that the impact of El Nino on landslide exposure can be greater in parts of Southeast Asia and Latin America than that due to seasonal rainfall variability. These findings improve our understanding of hazard variability around the world and can assist disaster mitigation efforts on seasonal timescales."

By comparing the spectra of the period with and without the type-B QPO, we found that the main difference appears at energy bands above∼2keV,suggesting that the QPO emission is dominated by the hard Comptonized component. During the transition, a change in the relative contribution of the disc and Comptonized emission was observed. The disc flux decreased while the Comptonized flux increased from non-QPO to type-B QPO. However, the total flux did not change too much in the NICER band. Our results reveal that the type-B QPO is associated with a redistribution of accretion power between the disc and Comptonized emission. When the type-B QPO appears, more accretion power is dissipated into the Comptonized region than in the disc. Our spectral fits give a hint that the increased Comptonized emission may come from an additional component that is related to the base of the jet."

However, one aspect that remains to be investigated is the intrinsic IR spectral intensities of solid HCN as opposed to relative band strengths, intrinsic intensities being needed to measure HCN abundances. Here we report measurements of IR absorption coefficients and band strengths, along with supporting refractive indices and densities, of both amorphous and crystalline HCN at two temperatures, one for interstellar work and one more relevant to the outer solar system. Spectra are presented at both temperatures, along with optical constants that can be used in numerical models. Despite widespread and longstanding interest in and investigations of solid HCN, this is the first time that the properties we are reporting have been measured in a single laboratory, avoiding the need for estimates or to combine results from various authors. We find that our measured band strength of ~1 × 1017 cm molecule1 for the CN vibration of HCN, in both amorphous HCN and in an H2O-rich ice, is substantially higher than an earlier estimate. Unless errors of 100% can be tolerated then our new value requires a rescaling of earlier work. Our results shed light on why HCN and other nitriles have been so difficult to identify in the solid state, in contrast to their many detections in the gas phase."

While they have not achieved the same photovoltaic (PV) efficiencies of top-performing perovskite thin films, they do reproducibly show high open circuit voltage (VOC) in comparison. Further understanding of the VOC attainable in PQDs as a function of surface passivation, contact layers, and PQD composition will further progress the field and may lend useful lessons for non-QD perovskite solar cells. Here, we use photoluminescence-based spectroscopic techniques to understand and identify the governing physics of the VOC in CsPbI3 PQDs. In particular, we probe the effect of the ligand exchange and contact interfaces on the VOC and free charge carrier concentration. The free charge carrier concentration is orders of magnitude higher than in typical perovskite thin films and could be tunable through ligand chemistry. Tuning the PQD A-site cation composition via replacement of Cs+ with FA+ maintains the background carrier concentration but reduces the trap density by up to a factor of 40, reducing the VOC deficit. These results dictate how to improve PQD optoelectronic properties and PV device performance and explain the reduced interfacial recombination observed by coupling PQDs with thin-film perovskites for a hybrid absorber layer."

Here, we present new discoveries and follow-up of three T-type subdwarf candidates, with an eye toward expanding the sample of such objects with very low metallicity and extraordinarily high kinematics, properties that suggest membership in the Galactic halo. Keck/NIRES near-infrared spectroscopy of WISEA J155349.96+693355.2, a fast-moving object discovered by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project, confirms that it is a mid-T subdwarf. With H(W2) = 22.3 mag, WISEA J155349.96+693355.2 has the largest W2 reduced proper motion among all spectroscopically confirmed L and T subdwarfs, suggesting that it may be kinematically extreme. Nevertheless, our modeling of the WISEA J155349.96+693355.2 near-infrared spectrum indicates that its metallicity is only mildly subsolar. In analyzing the J155349.96+693355.2 spectrum, we present a new grid of low-temperature, low-metallicity model atmosphere spectra. We also present the discoveries of two new esdT candidates, CWISE J073844.52−664334.6 and CWISE J221706.28−145437.6, based on their large motions and colors similar to those of the two known esdT objects.

We present a detailed analysis of the gaseous component of the N K-edge using high-resolution XMM–Newton spectra of 12 Galactic and 40 extragalactic sources. For each source, we have estimated column densities for N I, N II, N III, N V, N VI, and N VII ionic species, which trace the cold, warm, and hot phases of the local Galactic ISM. We have found that the cold-warm component column densities decrease with the Galactic latitude, while the hot component does not. Moreover, the cold column density distribution is in good agreement with UV measurements. This is the first detailed analysis of the nitrogen K-edge absorption due to ISM using high-resolution X-ray spectra."

Three notable objects in the magnetic field of the VLISM have been observed: two shocks and one pressure front. This paper reports the observation of a fourth object observed near 2020/DOY 147. There were no upstream electron plasma oscillations of the type often observed ahead of shocks, abrupt increases in energetic particles, or fluctuations in the 48 s increments of the magnetic field associated with this feature, suggesting that it was probably not a shock. This feature was associated with a relatively large increase in the magnetic field strength(B2/B1=1.35)and in the electron density determined by the Plasma Wave Science experiment (N2/N1=1.36) using a new method described in this paper. This feature appears to be a pressure front associated with a compressive wave in the VLISM. The two shocks and the two pressure fronts were associated with the four largest maxima observed in B (t) between 2012/DOY 238 and 2020/DOY 292. Each feature was associated with a jump–ramp structure. The jump–ramp structures were separated by long relatively undisturbed quiet intervals."

Lakes are also productive ecosystems that provide habitats and influence global cycles. Chlorophyll concentration provides a common metric of water quality, and is frequently used as a proxy for lake trophic state. Here, we document the generation and distribution of the complete MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS; Appendix A provides a complete list of abbreviations) radiometric time series for over 2300 satellite resolvable inland bodies of water across the contiguous United States (CONUS) and more than 5,000 in Alaska. This contribution greatly increases the ease of use of satellite remote sensing data for inland water quality monitoring, as well as highlights new horizons in inland water remote sensing algorithm development. We evaluate the performance of satellite remote sensing Cyanobacteria Index (CI)-based chlorophyll algorithms, the retrievals for which provide surrogate estimates of phytoplankton concentrations in cyanobacteria dominated lakes. Our analysis quantifies the algorithms' abilities to assess lake trophic state across the CONUS. As a case study, we apply a bootstrapping approach to derive a new CI-to-chlorophyll relationship, ChlBS, which performs relatively well with a multiplicative bias of 1.11 (11%) and mean absolute error of 1.60 (60%). While the primary contribution of this work is the distribution of the MERIS radiometric timeseries, we provide this case study as a roadmap for future stakeholders' algorithm development activities, as well as a tool to assess the strengths and weaknesses of applying a single algorithm across CONUS."
1899,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210026816,2023-08-03,Modelled land use and land cover change emissions – a spatio-temporal comparison of different approaches,"Quantifying the net carbon flux from land use and land cover changes (fLULCC) is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and, hence, to support climate change mitigation. However, large-scale fLULCC is not directly measurable and has to be inferred from models instead, such as semi-empirical bookkeeping models and process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). By definition, fLULCC estimates are not directly comparable between these two different model types. As an important example, DGVM-based fLULCC in the annual global carbon budgets is estimated under transient environmental forcing and includes the so-called loss of additional sink capacity (LASC). The LASC results from the impact of environmental changes on land carbon storage potential of managed land compared to potential vegetation and accumulates over time, which is not captured in bookkeeping models. The fLULCC from transient DGVM simulations, thus, strongly depends on the timing of land use and land cover changes mainly because LASC accumulation is cut off at the end of the simulated period. To estimate the LASC, the fLULCC from pre-industrial DGVM simulations, which is independent of changing environmental conditions, can be used. Additionally, DGVMs using constant present-day environmental forcing enable an approximation of bookkeeping estimates. Here, we analyse these three DGVM-derived fLULCC estimations (under transient, pre-industrial, and present-day forcing) for 12 models within 18 regions and quantify their differences as well as climate- and CO2-induced components and compare them to bookkeeping estimates. Averaged across the models, we find a global fLULCC (under transient conditions) of 2.0±0.6 PgC/yr for 2009–2018, of which ∼40 % are attributable to the LASC (0.8±0.3 PgC/yr). From 1850 onward, the fLULCC accumulated to 189±56 PgC with 40±15 PgC from the LASC. Around 1960, the accumulating nature of the LASC causes global transient fLULCC estimates to exceed estimates under present-day conditions, despite generally increased carbon stocks in the latter. Regional hotspots of high cumulative and annual LASC values are found in the USA, China, Brazil, equatorial Africa, and Southeast Asia, mainly due to deforestation for cropland. Distinct negative LASC estimates in Europe (early reforestation) and from 2000 onward in the Ukraine (recultivation of post-Soviet abandoned agricultural land), indicate that fLULCC estimates in these regions are lower in transient DGVM compared to bookkeeping approaches. Our study unravels the strong dependence of fLULCC estimates on the time a certain land use and land cover change event happened to occur and on the chosen time period for the forcing of environmental conditions in the underlying simulations. We argue for an approach that provides an accounting of the fLULCC that is more robust against these choices, for example by estimating a mean DGVM ensemble fLULCC and LASC for a defined reference period and homogeneous environmental changes (CO2 only)."

We address two critical questions for planetary science: 1) How, if at all, did Venus evolve through a habitable phase? 2) What circumstances affect how volatiles shape habitable worlds? More than any other group, volatile elements have a strong influence on the evolutionary paths of rocky bodies and are critical to understanding solar system evolution. It is clear that Venus experienced a different volatile element history from the Earth and provides the only accessible example of one end-state of habitable Earth-size planets. Venus will allow us to identify the mechanisms that operate together to produce and maintain habitable worlds like our own.The (VFM) concept architecture relies on five collaborative platforms: an Orbiter, Lander, variable-altitude Aerobot and two Small Satellites (SmallSats) delivered via a single launch on a Falcon 9 heavy expendable. The platforms would use multiple instruments to measure the exosphere, atmosphere and surface at multiple scales with high precision and over time. VFM would provide the first measurements of mineralogy and geochemistry of tessera terrain to examine rocks considered to be among the most likely to have formed in a habitable climate regime. Landed, descent, aerial and orbital platforms would work synergistically to measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere including the Aerobot operating for 60 days in the Venus clouds. Loss mechanisms would be constrained by the SmallSats in two key orbits. The baseline payload for VFM includes instruments to make the first measurements of seismicity and remanent magnetism, the first long-lived (60 day) surface platform and the first life detection instrument at Venus to interrogate what could be an inhabited world.The VFM concept directly addresses each of the three Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) goals as well as several of the strategic objectives of the 2020 NASA Science Plan, Planetary Science Division, Heliophysics and Astrophysics. The simultaneous, synergistic measurements of the solid body, surface, atmosphere and space environment provided by the VFM would allow us to target the most accessible Earth-size planet in our galaxy, and gain a profound new understanding of the evolution of our solar system and habitable worlds."

ASTERIA successfully completed its prime mission in early 2018, and continued to operate in low Earth orbit (LEO) for an additional twenty months. This paper describes demonstrations that were performed on the spacecraft and on the ground-based testbed during the extended mission. These demonstrations fall into three categories: Autonomy technology maturation, hardware characterization, and science discovery. Autonomy technology maturation supported three development efforts. The first shifted the spacecraft commanding paradigm from time-based sequences to Task Networks (tasknets), which allow simpler commanding and more robust onboard execution. The second demonstrated onboard orbit determination in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) without GPS. This activity used a fully-independent means of spacecraft orbit determination for Earth orbiters using only passive imaging. The third technology provided in situ hardware health state estimation using a model-based reasoning technique. These three technologies were demonstrated either in flight or on the testbed individually, and then were combined to demonstrate the capability to perform autonomous navigation on board without ground intervention, even in the presence of anomalies. Hardware characterization involved both onboard and ground-based activities. On board, nonstandard attitude control modes were commanded to characterize the spacecraft pointing jitter as a function of target brightness, reaction wheel speed, controller gain, and the number of guide stars. The results provide insights into the contribution of jitter to the ASTERIA photometry and inform the feasibility of future astrophysics small satellite missions for which jitter control is an enabling technology. On the ground, the ASTERIA Operations Team coordinated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to configure their new ground stations to communicate with ASTERIA to prove out their viability. ASTERIA used AWS ground stations for nominal operations for the last four months of the mission. Finally, ASTERIA continued to perform exoplanet science as the spacecraft was well-suited to execute long-term monitoring of stars such as alpha Centauri to search for small transiting planets. The science team also imaged a number of interesting objects including a comet, an asteroid, cities at night, and the moon, and coordinated with other projects on Targets of Opportunity for follow-up confirmations and co-observations. Throughout the prime and the extended missions, the ASTERIA spacecraft proved to be a mighty platform that “will go into history as an innovative milestone.”[1 - Zurbuchen]"

After successfully completing its 90-day primary mission that demonstrated arcsecond-level line-of-sight pointing and focal plane thermal stability for exoplanet detection, it entered an extended mission performing onboard software demonstrations to mature technology both in space and on the ground. One of the technologies was a completely cloud-based ground system leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) Ground Station service.Announced in December 2018 and launched in May 2019, AWS Ground Station is a fully managed ground station service that aims to reduce the overhead associated with developing and maintaining ground system infrastructure throughout the mission lifecycle. AWS Ground Station makes available the suite of features required for any ground system in support of low-Earth orbit (LEO) and medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite operations on-demand and without setting up or maintaining long-term contracts. Charges are incurred on a per-minute basis for antenna usage during scheduled tracks. Support is available for S-band uplink and downlink, along with X-band narrowband and wideband downlink. Missions that use the service may reserve tracks with any licensed AWS Ground Station antennas located across each service region and have direct access to any AWS services in support of mission operations.The cloud-based architecture built around the AWS Ground Station service greatly enhanced ASTERIA mission operations by enabling end-to-end pass automation, on-demand contact scheduling and contingency planning, along with more efficient data downlink through station availability and station-to-station handovers. It incorporated open-source software, particularly NASA's AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT) and Open Mission Control Technologies (OpenMCT), along with the AWS application programming interfaces (API) to the Ground Station, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage Service (S3) services. After showcasing operability in August 2019, the team continued using and improving this novel ground system architecture until the end of mission in December 2019. This paper describes the cloud-based ground system, how it was designed, tested, and evaluated with an in-orbit spacecraft, the operational capabilities that it enabled, along with lessons learned and recommendations for future missions."

However, the performance of traditional computer vision techniques developed for electro-optical imagery does not directly translate to the thermal domain due to two major reasons: these algorithms require photometric assumptions to hold, and methods for photometric calibration of RGB cameras cannot be applied to thermal-infrared cameras due to difference in data acquisition and sensor phenomenology. In this paper, we take a step in this direction, and introduce a novel algorithm for online photometric calibration of thermalinfrared cameras. Our proposed method does not require any specific driver/hardware support and hence can be applied to any commercial off-the-shelf thermal IR camera. We present this in the context of visual odometry and SLAM algorithms, and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system through extensive experiments for both standard benchmark datasets, and real-world field tests with a thermal-infrared camera in natural outdoor environments."

As plans for new, exciting exploration missions to the Moon, Mars and other planetary bodies are being developed, there is a need for a new generation of TDRs that are smaller, consume less power and are less expensive than previous sensors. The challenge of designing such a landing sensor is twofold: the first is to have well-vetted software tools that allow us to explore the design space for a particular mission scenario and analyze performance of relevant radar architectures. The second challenge is to reduce mass and power requirements of a landing radar without compromising reliability and performance. New design approaches that address these challenges need to be tested and demonstrated in realistic Entry-Descent-Landing (EDL)/Deorbit-Descent-Landing (DDL) scenarios. In this paper, we describe a TDR testbed developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The testbed is a closed-loop design, analysis and verification capability used to design and evaluate the next generation of landing radars for a variety of EDL/DDL scenarios."

The prime objective of the radio science investigation is to estimate the gravitational field of Jupiter from the Doppler shift on the radio link between the spacecraft and the Earth-based observing antennas of NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN). The instrument is composed of a ground component at the DSN’s DSS-25 antenna, equipped with simultaneous dual X- and Ka-band transmitters and receivers, and a spacecraft component, which includes X- and Ka-band transponders to relay the transmitted signal back to Earth. The frequencies of these signals are measured using sensitive open-loop and closed-loop receivers of the DSN. Using the unique geometry of Juno’s orbit around Jupiter and the exquisite precision of the radio science instrumentation (~5-10 microns/sec one-way), the gravity field of Jupiter has been probed to unprecedented precision, allowing for discoveries of Jupiter’s core size and depth of the zonal winds. This precision is thanks to a detailed data processing and calibration techniques. An Advanced Water Vapor Radiometer measures the tropospheric delay and a linear combination X- and Ka-band links calibrates for Earth ionosphere, solar plasma, and Jovian plasma. Recent measurements probed the electron content inside Jupiter’s Io Plasma Torus, a doughnut-shaped ring of charged particles caught in Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Results from these measurements not only contributes to the scientific literature but also informs the performance of the instrument itself and can be used in future planning."

In contrast to function-level autonomy, which focuses on capabilities required to achieve a specific function such as surface navigation or image recognition, system-level autonomy addresses the needs to coordinate and manage activities and resources, and estimate the state, across subsystems. This paper describes demonstrations that were conducted on a spacecraft workstation testbed.

These components are embedded in a system-level framework defining how goals are formed and executed, which elements exist, and how control authority is distributed among components. The planning and execution system at the heart of the framework has the capability to schedule, execute and monitor completion of tasks, as well as plan around unexpected events including new science opportunities and anomalies. The planning and scheduling system is the Multi-mission EXECutive (MEXEC), supported by the system-level health state estimator Model-Based Off-Nominal State Identification and Detection (MONSID), and Autonomous Navigation (AutoNav) algorithms, which determine the orbital system state based on optical observation of other targets. These components are applicable to many kinds of missions on different platforms. These demonstrations were elaborations of earlier experiments conducted on the ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research In Astrophysics) CubeSat, described in a companion submission [1]. The spacecraft’s extended mission served as an in-flight test platform, during which some individual autonomous capabilities were flown successfully. The autonomy experiments described here were performed on the ASTERIA workstation testbed."

To conduct its primary science mission, Lunar Flashlight must be placed in a stable lunar polar orbit which requires the utilization of an on-board propulsion system. However, to this date, most CubeSats have been propelled by cold-gas or electric propulsion systems that have proven to scale well but lack sufficient impulse to conduct large $\Delta V$ maneuvers such as orbit insertions. To this end, the Lunar Flashlight mission has chosen to utilize a custom-designed green monopropellant propulsion system developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology under the leadership of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and support from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The developed system is capable of providing more than the required propulsive capability for full mission success while fitting inside of a 2.5U volume and weighing less than six kilograms. The system utilizes the Advanced Space Craft Energetic Non Toxic (ASCENT) green monopropellant that provides higher specific impulse compared to traditional hydrazine while also being safer to handle. If successful, the presented propulsion system will enable Lunar Flashlight to be the first CubeSat to reach the Moon, the first to conduct an orbit insertion, and will be the first CubeSat demonstration of the ASCENT propellant."

We model with MYTORUS their broadband X-ray spectra from 20 individual observations with Suzaku, accounting self-consistently for Fe Kα line emission, as well as direct and scattered continuum from matter with finite column density and solar Fe abundance. Our model configuration allows us to measure the global, out of the line of sight, equivalent hydrogen column density separately from that in the line of sight. For 5 out of 20 observations (in 3 AGNs) we find that the global column density is in fact ≳1.5 × 1024 per sq.cm, consistent with the distant scattering matter being Compton-thick. For a fourth AGN, two out of five observations are also consistent with being Compton-thick, although with large errors. Some of these AGNs have been reported to host relativistically broadened Fe Kα emission. Based on our modeling, the Fe Kα emission line is not resolved in all but two Suzaku observations, and the data can be fitted well with models that only include a narrow Fe Kα emission line."

Even if significant efforts are spent on water development projects, ineffective project planning often means that they continue to occur or are only partly mitigated, for  example, in the Mun River Basin, Thailand, where 1000s of water projects  have been implemented. Despite this, the basin regularly experiences floods and droughts. In this study, an analysis of the adverse impacts of basin-scale floods and droughts on rice cultivation in the Mun River  Basin is conducted, and an estimation of the coping capacity of existing measures. The results demonstrate that while the total storage capacity of in-situ and ongoing projects would be sufficient to tackle both hazards, it can only be achieved if the projects are effectively utilised. Based on this, proposed solutions for the region include small farm ponds, a subsurface floodwater harvesting system, and oxbow lake  reconnections. The suggested measures are practicable, economical, environmentally low-impact, and their implementation (if executed with appropriate care) would reduce flood and drought problems in the basin. Notably, the measures and calculation methods proposed for this basin can also be applied to other crops and regions."

used as metrics of high latitude ecosystem change based on the assumption that NDVI change is associated with ecological change, generally as changes in green vegetation amount (green leaf area index [LAI] or plant cover). Further, no change in NDVI is often interpreted as no change in these variables. Three canopy reflectance models including linear mixture model, the SAIL (Scattering from Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) model, and the GeoSail model were used to simulate scenarios representing high latitude landscape NDVI responses to changes in LAI and plant cover. The simulations showed inconsistent NDVI responses. Clear increases in NDVI are generally associated with increases in LAI and plant cover. At higher values of LAI, the change in NDVI per unit change in LAI decreases, with very little change in spruce forest NDVI where crown cover is >50% and at the tundra–taiga ecotone with transitions from shrub tundra to spruce woodland. These lower responses may bias the interpretation of greening/browning trends in boreal forests. Variations in water or snow coverage were shown to produce outsized nonbiological NDVI responses. Inconsistencies in NDVI responses exemplify the need for care in the interpretation of NDVI change as a metric of high latitude ecosystem change, and that landscape characteristics in terms of the type of cover and its characteristics, such as the initial plant cover, must be taken into account in evaluating the significance of any observed NDVI trends."

In  response,  NASA commissioned a multi-center Surface Deformation and Change(SDC) team to perform a five year study of mission architectures that would support SDC observables and provide the most value to the  diverse  science  and  applications  communities  it  serves. The  study  is  being  conducted  in  phases,  in  which  the  science and  applications  capabilities  identified  in  the  Decadal  Survey are refined, candidate architectures and associated technologies to support these needs are identified, architectures are assessed against a science value framework specific to SDC, and recommendations to NASA are made.  Ultimately, NASA will decide which amongst these recommendations will proceed to mission formulation.  As synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was identified as  the  prime  sensor  technology  to  satisfy  SDC  observational needs, a key component of the SDC study is to assess the current state of the art in SAR sensor and supporting technology.  The number of SAR systems, both civil and commercial, is growing rapidly, requiring that mission architectures not only consider technology, but availability of data from other missions, possible partnerships  or  collaborations,  and  even  data  purchase.   The mechanism for assessment involves development of an end-to-end science performance evaluation tool for multi-satellite con-stellations, which feeds into a science value framework that con-siders science performance,  technological programmatic risks, and  cost.

We developed new metrics for quantifying internal vegetation structural complexity using terrestrial LiDAR scanning and applied them to 12 NEON forest plots across an elevational gradient in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. We asked (1) How do our newly developed structure metrics compare to traditional metrics? (2) How does forest structure vary with elevation in a high-biodiversity, high topographic complexity region? (3) How do forest structural metrics vary in the strength of their relationships with vascular plant biodiversity? Our new measures of canopy density (Depth) and structural complexity (σDepth), and their canopy height-normalized counterparts, were sensitive to structural variations and effectively summarized horizontal and vertical dimensions of structural complexity. Forest structure varied widely across plots spanning the elevational range of GRSM, with taller, more structurally complex forests at lower elevation. Vascular plant biodiversity was negatively correlated with elevation and more strongly positively correlated with vegetation structure variables. The strong correlations we observed between canopy structural complexity and biodiversity suggest that structural complexity metrics could be used to assay plant biodiversity over large areas in concert with airborne and spaceborne platforms."

In NASA’s current Collection 6 and 6.1 Level 1B products  (C6/C6.1  L1B),  the  RSB  calibration  algorithm  continues  to  rely  primarily  on  the  onboard  solar  diffuser  to calibrate  the  instrument  gain.  Lunar  observations  are  used  to  track  on-orbit  changes  in  the  response  versus  scan  angle (RVS), and data from pseudo-invariant desert sites are used to apply adjustments to the gain and RVS calibration for select bands.  The  resulting  reflectance  products  have  in  general  shown a very  stable  performance.  In  recent  years,  some performance degradation has been noted for a few bands and algorithm changes have been tested to further improve the calibration  accuracy  for  the  upcoming  Collection  7  (C7)  L1B  reprocess.  In  this  paper,  we  present  the  MODIS  RSB calibration improvements that will be included in C7. Major improvements include: applying polarization correction to the desert data before using it to generateRVS for Terra bands 8, 9, 3, and 10; using ocean scene data and an interband calibration approach to correct for long-term drift of Terra bands 11 and 12; applying an updated crosstalk correction to Terra SWIR bands over the entire mission; and using data from deep convective clouds in Terra SWIR band calibration, including the addition of time-dependent RVS for bands 5 and 26. All other minor calibration changes are also covered. Overall, the reflectance differences at nadir between C6.1 and C7 are within a few percent, though the differences increase in  some  cases  at  large  scan  angles.  The  Terra  visible  (3,  8-12)  and  SWIR  bands  (5-7,  26)  have  the  most  significant improvements. For all other Terra bands and all Aqua bands, the C7-C6.1 differences are mostly within 1%"

Ideally, DEMs record theinterface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere using a discrete two-dimensional grid, withcomplexities introduced by the intervening hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere.The treatment of DEM surfaces, affected by these intervening spheres, depends on their intendeduse, and the characteristics of the sensors that were used to create them.  DEM is a general term,and more specific terms such as digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM) recordthe treatment of the intermediate surfaces. Several global DEMs generated with optical (visible andnear-infrared) sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as single/multi-beam sonars andproducts of satellite altimetry, share the common characteristic of a georectified, gridded storagestructure. Nevertheless, not all DEMs share the same vertical datum, not all use the same conventionfor the area on the ground represented by each pixel in the DEM, and some of them have variable dataspacings depending on the latitude. This paper highlights the importance of knowing, understandingand reflecting on the sensor and DEM characteristics and consolidates terminology and definitions ofkey concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users,who do not necessarily share the same background"

However, spatially explicit inventories are necessary to facilitate management and protection of mangroves, as well as providing a foundation for payment for ecosystem service programs such as REDD+. We conducted an inventory of carbon stocks in mangroves within Pongara National Park (PNP), Gabon using a stratified random sampling design based on forest canopy height derived from TanDEM-X remote sensing data. Ecosystem carbon pools, including aboveground and belowground biomass and necromass, and soil carbon to a depth of 2 m were assessed using measurements and samples from plots distributed among three canopy height classes within the park. There were two mangrove species within the inventory area in PNP, Rhizophora racemosa and R. harrisonii. R. harrisonii was predominant in the sparse, low-stature stands that dominated the west side of the park. In the east side of the park, both species occurred in tall-stature stands, with tree height often exceeding 30 m. Canopy height was an effective means to stratify the inventory area, as biomass was significantly different among the height classes. Despite those differences in aboveground biomass, the soil carbon density was not significantly different among height classes. Soils were the main component of the ecosystem carbon stock, accounting for over 84% of the total. The ecosystem carbon density ranged from 644 to 943 Mg C ha−1 among the three height classes. The ecosystem carbon stock within PNP is estimated to be 40,588 Gg C. The combination of pre-inventory information about stand conditions and their spatial distribution within the assessment area obtained from remote sensing data and a spatial decision support system were fundamental to implementing this relatively large-scale field inventory. This work exemplifies how mangrove carbon stocks can be quantified to augment national C reporting statistics, provide a baseline for projects involving monitoring, reporting and verification (i.e., MRV), and provide data on the forest composition and structure for sustainable management and conservation practices."

These observations have substantially enhanced our understanding of the Earth's terrestrial dynamics, both as a major element of the Earth's physical system, the primary home of humans, and the major source of resources that support them. The history of Landsat is complex, reflective of the human systems that sustain it. Despite the conflicted perspectives surrounding the continuation of the program, Landsat has survived based on worldwide recognition of its critical contributions to understanding land dynamics, management of natural resources and Earth system science.

VIIRS has 22 spectral bands, among which 14 are reflective solar bands (RSBs) covering a spectral range from 0.41 to 2.25 μm. The SNPP VIIRS RSBs are primarily calibrated by the onboard solar diffuser (SD), with its on-orbit degradation tracked by an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM). The near-monthly scheduled lunar observations, together with the sensor responses over stable ground targets, have contributed to the sensor’s mission-long on-orbit calibration and characterization. Numerous improvements have been made in the RSB calibration methodology since SNPP VIIRS was launched, and the RSB calibration has reached a mature stage after almost ten years of on-orbit operation. SNPP is a joint NASA/NOAA mission and there are two teams, the NASA VIIRS Calibration Support Team (VCST) and the NOAA VIIRS Sensor Data Record Team, which are dedicated to SNPP VIIRS on-orbit calibration. In this paper, we focus on the calibration performed by the NASA VCST. The SNPP VIIRS RSB calibration methodologies used to produce the calibration coefficient look up tables for the latest NASA Level 1B Collection 2 products are reviewed and the calibration improvements incorporated in this collection are described. Recent calibration changes include the removal of image striping caused by non-uniform degradation of the SD, improvements to the method for combining lunar and SD data, mitigation of the effects due a recent anomaly in the SD measurements, estimation of the SD degradation beyond 935 nm, and fitting strategy improvements for look-up table delivery. Overall, the SNPP VIIRS RSBs have performed well since its launch and continue to meet design specifications."

We examined the bioavailability and photoreactivity of CDOM exported from four Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes across three seasons and along an estuarine salinity gradient using three incubation treatments: 14-day microbial (MD), 7-day combined photochemical/microbial (PB+MD), and 7-day microbial incubation after photobleaching (MD after PB). CDOM absorption at 300 nm (aCDOM300) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations showed strong seasonality, with minima in winter, but CDOM quality (absorption spectral slopes, fluorescence component ratios) was less variable seasonally. PB+MD over 7 days decreased aCDOM300 (–56.0%), humic-like fluorescence (–67.6%), and DOC (–17.8%), but increased the spectral slope ratio SR (=S275-295/S300-350) (+94.8%), suggesting a decrease in CDOM molecular weight. Photochemistry dominated the PB+MD treatment. Photoreactivity was greater during the winter and in marsh/watershed versus down-estuary sites, likely due to less previous light exposure. Prior photobleaching increased the bioavailability of marsh-exported CDOM, resulting in a greater loss of aCDOM300 and DOC, and a greater increase in humic-like fluorescence (–6.0%, –5.9%, and +18.4% change, respectively, over 7-day MD after PB incubations, versus –2.8%, –5.5%, and +2.6% change, respectively, over 14-day MD incubations). CDOM exported from a marsh downstream of a major wastewater treatment plant showed the greatest photoreactivity and bioavailability. This highlights the significance of human activity on estuarine CDOM quality and biogeochemical cycles."

This study proposed a human-centric framework to examine human personal heat exposure based on anonymous GPS trajectories data mining and urban microclimate modeling. The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) that represents the human body’s energy balance was used to indicate human heat exposure. The meteorological data and high-resolution 3D urban model generated from multispectral remotely sensed images and LiDAR data were used as inputs in urban microclimate modeling to map the spatio-temporal distribution of the Tmrt in the Boston metropolitan area. The anonymous human GPS trajectory data collected from fitness Apps was used to map the spatiotemporal distribution of human outdoor activities. By overlaying the anonymous GPS trajectories on the generated spatio-temporal maps of Tmrt, this study further examined the heat exposure of runners in different age-gender groups in the Boston area. Results show that there is no significant difference in terms of heat exposure for female and male runners. The female runners in the age of 45-54 are exposed to more heat than female runners of 18-24 and 25-34, while there is no significant difference among male runners. This study proposed a novel method to estimate human heat exposure, which would shed new light on mitigating the negative impacts of heat on human health."

Forest type is an important metric measured in the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, the national forest inventory of the USA. Forest type information can be used to quantify carbon and other forest resources within specific domains to support ecological analysis and forest management decisions, such as managing for disease and pests. In this study, we developed a methodology that uses a combination of airborne hyperspectral and lidar data to map FIA-defined forest type between sparsely sampled FIA plot data collected in interior Alaska. To determine the best classification algorithm and remote sensing data for this task, five classification algorithms were tested with six different combinations of raw hyperspectral data, hyperspectral vegetation indices, and lidar-derived canopy and topography metrics. Models were trained using forest type information from 632 FIA subplots collected in interior Alaska. Of the thirty model and input combinations tested, the random forest classification algorithm with hyperspectral vegetation indices and lidar-derived topography and canopy height metrics had the highest accuracy (78% overall accuracy). This study supports random forest as a powerful classifier for natural resource data. It also demonstrates the benefits from combining both structural (lidar) and spectral (imagery) data for forest type classification."

The ground-based light curve indicates a low planet–host star mass ratio ofq=(6.9±0.2)×10−5, which is near the peak of the wide-orbit exoplanet mass-ratio distribution. We estimate the host star and planet masses with a Bayesian analysis using the measured angular Einstein radius under the assumption that stars of all masses have an equal probability of hosting the planet. The flux variation observed by Spitzer is marginal, but still places a constraint on the microlens parallax. Imposing a conservative constraint that  this flux  variation  should  beΔfSpz<4  instrumental flux units yields a host mass of=-+MM0.37 host 0.210.35 and a planet mass of =-+ÅmM8.4p4.77.9. A Bayesian analysis including the full parallax constraint from Spitzer suggests smaller host star and planet masses of =-+MM0.091 host 0.0180.064 and =-+ÅmM2.1p0.41.5, respectively. Future high-resolution imaging observations with the Hubble Space Telescope or Extremely Large Telescope could distinguish between these two scenarios and help reveal the planetary system properties in more detail."

It is found that the overall features of the light curve are approximately described by a binary-lens (2L1S) model, but the model leaves substantial residuals. We test various interpretations with the aim of explaining the residuals. Methods. We find that the residuals can be explained either by considering a  nonrectilinear lens-source motion caused by the microlens-parallax and lens-orbital effects or by adding a low-mass companion to the binary lens (3L1S model). The degeneracy between the higher-order 2L1S model and the 3L1S model is very severe, making it difficult to single out a correct solution based on the photometric data. This degeneracy was known before for two previous events (MACHO-97-BLG-41 and OGLE-2013-BLG-0723),which led to the false detections of planets in binary systems, and thus the identification of the degeneracy for KMT-2021-BLG-0322illustrates that the degeneracy can be not only common but also very severe, emphasizing the need to check both interpretations of deviations from 2L1S models. 
Results. From the Bayesian analysis conducted with the measured lensing observables of the event timescale, angular Einstein radius, and microlens parallax, it was estimated that the binary lens components have masses(M1,M2)=(0.62+0.25−0.26M,0.07+0.03−0.03M), for both2L1S and 3L1S solutions, and the mass of the tertiary lens component according to the 3L1S solution isM3=6.40+2.64−2.78MJ."

To investigate the role of mergers in the observed AGN and star formation enhancement, we apply both quantitative (Sérsic-fit and Gini–M20)and visual morphological classifications to F160W images of protocluster Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) in the fields of the X-ray AGN and z∼3field LBGs in SSA22 and GOODS-N. We find no statistically significant differences between the morphologies and merger fractions of protocluster and field LBGs, though we are limited by small number statistics in the protocluster. We also fit the UV-to-near-IR spectral energy distributions of F160W-detected protocluster and field LBGs to characterize their stellar masses and star formation histories. We find that the mean protocluster LBG is a factor of∼2 times more massive and more attenuated than the mean z∼3field LBG. We take our results to suggest that ongoing mergers are not more common among protocluster LBGs than field LBGs, though protocluster LBGs appear to be more massive. We speculate that the larger mass of the protocluster LBGs contributes to the enhancement of SMBH mass and accretion rate in the protocluster, which in turn drives the observed protocluster AGN enhancement"

During Sector 21, the planet TIC 172900988b transited the primary star and then five days later it transited the secondary star. The binary is itself eclipsing, with a period P ≈ 19.7 days and an eccentricity e ≈ 0.45. Archival data from ASAS-SN, Evryscope, KELT, and SuperWASP reveal a prominent apsidal motion of the binary orbit, caused by the dynamical interactions between the binary and the planet. A comprehensive photodynamical analysis of the TESS, archival and follow-up data yields stellar masses and radii of M(1) = 1.2384 ± 0.0007 Mꙩ and R(1) = 1.3827 ± 0.0016 Rꙩ for the primary and M(2) = 1.2019 ± 0.0007 Mꙩ and R(2) = 1.3124 ± 0.0012 Rꙩ for the secondary. The radius of the planet is R(3) = 11.25 ± 0.44 Rꚛ (1.004 ± 0.039R(Jup)). The planet’s mass and orbital properties are not uniquely determined—there are six solutions with nearly equal likelihood. Specifically, we find that the planet’s mass is in the range of 824 ≲ M3 ≲ 981 Mꚛ (2.65 ≲ M3 ≲ 3.09M(Jup)), its orbital period could be 188.8, 190.4, 194.0, 199.0, 200.4, or 204.1 days, and the eccentricity is between 0.02 and 0.09.

Transient emission lines disappearing shortly after the supernova explosion suggest that the material spatial extent is compact and implies an increased mass loss shortly prior to explosion. Here, we present a systematic survey for such transient emission lines (Flash Spectroscopy) among Type II supernovae detected in the first year of the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. We find that at least six out of ten events for which a spectrum was obtained within two days of the estimated explosion time show evidence for such transient flash lines. Our measured flash event fraction (>30% at 95% confidence level) indicates that elevated mass loss is a common process occurring in massive stars that are about to explode as supernovae."

The burst was not detected by Fermi-LAT, but was detected by Fermi-GBM without triggering, possibly due to the gradual nature of the rising light curve. Using ground-based photometry, we estimate a photometric redshift of z(sub phot) = 3.29 ± 0.40. Combined with the high-energy emission and optical peak time derived from TESS, estimates of the bulk Lorentz factor Γ(sub BL) range from 90 to 133. The burst is relatively bright, with a peak optical magnitude in ground-based follow-up of R = 15.1 mag. Using published distributions of GRB afterglows and considering the TESS sensitivity and sampling, we estimate that TESS is likely to detect ∼1 GRB afterglow per year above its magnitude limit."

The host star is bright (K = 7.1) and nearby (10.6 pc), making the system a prime target for follow-up characterization with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Herein, we use simulated transmission spectroscopy to evaluate the detectability of spectral features with HST and JWST assuming diverse atmospheric scenarios (e.g., atmospheres dominated by H2, H2O, CO2, or O2). We find that H2O and CH4 present in a low mean molecular weight atmosphere could be detected with HST in one transit for the two outermost planets, while H2O in a clear steam atmosphere could be detected in six transits or fewer with HST for all three planets. We predict that observations using JWST/NIRISS would be capable of detecting a clear steam atmosphere in one transit for each planet and H2O absorption in a hazy steam atmosphere in two transits or less. In a clear, desiccated atmosphere, O2 absorption may be detectable for all three planets with NIRISS. If the L 98-59 planets possess a clear, Venus-like atmosphere, NIRSpec could detect CO2 within 26 transits for each planet, but the presence of H2SO4 clouds would significantly suppress CO2 absorption. The L 98-59 system is an excellent laboratory for comparative planetary studies of transiting multiplanet systems, and observations of the system via HST and JWST would present a unique opportunity to test the accuracy of the models presented in this study."

Currently, as a tandem, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and −8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) provide an acquisition opportunity on an 8-day revisit interval. Sentinel-2A and -2B MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), with a wider swath, have a 5-day revisit interval at the equator. Due to robust pre- and post-launch cross-calibration, it has been possible for NASA to produce the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data product from Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI: L30 and S30, respectively. Knowledge of the agreement of HLS outputs (especially S30) with historic Landsat surface reflectance products will inform the ability to integrate historic time-series information with new and more frequent measures as delivered by HLS. In this research, we control for acquisition date and data source to cross-compare the HLS data (L30, S30) with established Landsat-8 OLI surface-reflectance measures as delivered by the USGS (hereafter BAP, Best Available Pixel). S30 and L30 were found to have high agreement (R = 0.87–0.96) for spectral channels and an r = 0.99 for Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) with low relative root-mean-square difference values (1.7%–3.3%). Agreement between L30 and BAP was lower, with R values ranging from 0.85 to 0.92 for spectral channels and R = 0.94 for NBR. S30 and BAP had the lowest agreement, with R values ranging from 0.71 to 0.85 for spectral channels and r = 0.90 for NBR. Comparisons indicated a stronger agreement at latitudes above 55° N. Some dependency between spectral agreement and land cover was found, with stronger correspondence for non-vegetated cover types. The level of agreement between S30 and BAP reported herein would enable integration of HLS outputs with historic Landsat data. The resulting increased temporal frequency of data allows for improvements to current cloud screening practices and increases data density and the likelihood of temporal proximity to target date for pixel compositing approaches. Furthermore, additional within-year observations will enable change products with a higher temporal fidelity and allow for the incorporation of phenological trends into land cover classification algorithms."

Results could also apply to detection of NPV in pasture, grazing lands, and non-agricultural settings. Currently, there are no satellite data sources that provide narrowband or hyperspectral SWIR imagery at sufficient volume to map NPV at a regional scale. The Landsat Next mission, currently under design and expected to launch in the late 2020’s, provides the opportunity for achieving increased SWIR sampling and spectral resolution with the adoption of new sensor technology. This study employed hyperspectral data collected from 916 agricultural field locations with varying fractional NPV, fractional green vegetation, and surface moisture contents. These spectra were processed to generate narrow bands with centers at 2040, 2100, 2210, 2260, and 2230 nm, at various bandwidths, that were subsequently used to derive 13 NPV spectral indices from each spectrum. For crop residues with minimal green vegetation cover, two-band indices derived from 2210 and 2260 nm bands were top performers for measuring NPV (R^(2) = 0.81, RMSE = 0.13) using bandwidths of 30 to 50 nm, and the addition of a third band at 2100 nm increased resistance to atmospheric correction residuals and improved mission continuity with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager Band 7. For prediction of NPV over a full range of green vegetation cover, the Cellulose Absorption Index, derived from 2040, 2100, and 2210 nm bands, was top performer (R^(2) = 0.77, RMSE = 0.17), but required a narrow (≤20 nm) bandwidth at 2040 nm to avoid interference from atmospheric carbon dioxide absorption. In comparison, broadband NPV indices utilizing Landsat 8 bands centered at 1610 and 2200 nm performed poorly in measuring fractional NPV (R^(2) = 0.44), with significantly increased interference from green vegetation"

Globally, regionally, or locally, elevation datasetshave many grid points. Many software packages calculate gradi-ents over every grid cell or point, but in the mountains, shadingby nearby terrain must also be assessed. Terrain may obscure aslope that would otherwise face the Sun. Four decadesago, a fastmethod to calculate topographic horizons at every point in anelevation grid required computations related only linearly to thesize of the grid, but grids now have so many points that parallelcomputing still provides an advantage. Exploiting parallelismover terrain grids can use alternative strategies: among columnsof a rotated grid, or simultaneously at multiple rotation angles,or on different tiles of a grid.

Use of the fractional snow cover maps fromLandsat 8 OLI shows a negative bias of−0.5% for MODSCAG and−1.3% for VIIRSCAG,whereas previous MODSCAG evaluations found a bias of−7.6% in the Himalaya. Wefindsimilar root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.133 and 0.125 for MODIS and VIIRS,respectively. The Recall statistic (probability of detection) for cells with more than 15%snow cover in this challenging steep topography was found to be 0.90 for both MODSCAGand VIIRSCAG, significantly higher than previous evaluations based on Landsat 5Thematic Mapper (TM) and 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). In addition,daily retrievals from MODIS and VIIRS are consistent across gradients of elevation, slope,and aspect. Different native resolutions of the gridded products at 1 km and 500 m forVIIRS and MODIS, respectively, result in snow cover maps showing a slightly differentdistribution of values with VIIRS having more mixed pixels and MODIS having 7% morepure snow pixels. Despite the resolution differences, the snow maps from both sensorsproduce similar total snow-covered areas and snow-line elevations in this region, withR2values of 0.98 and 0.88, respectively. Wefind that the SCAG algorithm performsconsistently across various spatial resolutions and that fractional snow cover mapsfrom the VIIRS instruments aboard Suomi NPP, JPPS–1, and JPPS–2 can be asuitable replacement as MODIS sensors reach their ends of life."

The objective of this study is to identify homogenous zones over Paraíba State in relation to the state, duration and severity of droughts that have occurred over the last 20 years (1998–2017) using hierarchical cluster analysis based on both gauge-measured and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) estimated rainfall data (TMPA 3B42). The drought series were calculated using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based on eight time scales and were grouped according to drought state, duration and severity time series. The integrated results of state, duration and severity of droughts indicate that there is a basis for dividing Paraíba State into two major regions (a) Zone I, formed by Mata Paraibana and Agreste Paraibano, and (b) Zone II, composed by Borborema and Sertão Paraibano. This division is evident when assessing short-term droughts, but in the case of long-term droughts, Paraíba State has a high similarity in terms of drought state, duration, and severity. Factors such as proximity to the ocean, active climatic systems, and the local relief configuration were identified as influencing the drought regime. Finally, it is concluded that TMPA rainfall estimates represent a valuable source of data to regionalize and identify drought patterns over this part of Brazil and that other studies of this type should be carried out to monitor these phenomena based on other satellite-based rainfall data, including the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM)."

Perennial cropping systems and microbial biofertilizer supplements are two emerging strategies to increase agricultural sustainability that are studied in tandem for the first time in this study. During the establishment phase of a perennial switchgrass stand in SW Montana, USA, we supplemented synthetic fertilization with a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial biofertilizer (CBF) and were able to maintain aboveground crop productivity in comparison to a synthetic only (urea) fertilizer treatment. Soil chemical analysis conducted at the end of the growing season revealed that late-season nitrogen availability in CBF-supplemented field plots increased relative to urea-only plots. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities suggested fine-scale responses of the microbial community and sensitivity to fertilization among arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Given their critical role in plant productivity and soil nutrient cycling, soil microbiome monitoring is vital to understand the impacts of implementation of alternative agricultural practices on soil health."

This algorithm is useful in proximity links where no Doppler pre-compensation is available at the transmitter, and allows the receiver to acquire the incoming carrier even if the experienced Doppler shift is several orders of magnitude larger than the PLL bandwidth. Other applications for this algorithm include Multiple Uplink per Antenna at the Deep Space Network, and generation of observables (Doppler shift, Doppler rate, range rate) for in-situ navigation purposes. This paper enhances a previously presented adaptive-sweep algorithm and its performance analysis in two fronts. First, the algorithm now uses the direction function to automatically estimate the required frequency jump to achieve PLL lock. This enables a fully adaptive-sweep scheme in which system implementer does not need to manually select thresholds. On the other hand, we study the system performance in the presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise and derive necessary conditions for the system to operate at low signal-to-noise conditions. This allows us to create design rules that specify all parameters of the algorithm given a set of system-level requirements. To test the performance of the proposed algorithm, we implement it in GNU Radio, an open-source Software-Defined Radio that interfaces with several commercial radio peripherals. We use this implementation to demonstrate carrier lock and quantify system performance under different noise conditions. We also test the algorithm using open-loop recordings of two downlinks between the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Deep Space Network. We show that even after large frequency jumps (tens of kHz), the proposed system is able to rapidly reacquire the carrier and continue operation."

Our effort integrated the Model-based Off-Nominal State Identification and Detection (MONSID) model-based reasoning system, developed by Okean Solutions, into ASTERIA flight software using the F Prime software framework. The MONSID engine was supplied with a model of the Blue Canyon Technologies XACT attitude control system (ACS) and tested against flight data and seeded fault tests. While we were unable to conduct an on-board experiment due to the premature loss of ASTERIA, our effort proved the feasibility of on-board model-based fault management, demonstrating reliable and accurate diagnosis using captured data, and further supporting a closed-loop spacecraft autonomy demonstration including autonomous navigation in off-nominal conditions."

MSR would, for the first time ever, present a need to communicate with multiple surface assets that are co-located on Mars in a coordinated effort to accomplish the unified objective of fetching, transporting, and returning samples from Mars. Currently, Mars surface assets relay data to and from Earth using a number of orbiters in what’s known as the Mars Relay Network (MRN). This network is characterized by a small number of surface assets distributed across the Martian globe and a larger number of orbiters to provide relay services. As of June 2020, there are two surface assets for which five orbiters are providing relay. During the MSR Campaign, there would be two rovers and a lander that all would require relay communication from a small number of Mars orbiters to meet the aggressive MSR timeline. The inversion of the current MRN paradigm, a system of many surface assets requiring relay and few orbiters to provide relay, necessitates the unique challenge of optimally allocating relay passes to maximize the operational capability of all assets. The allocation must consider a large number of trade variables including Mars asset operational requirements and Earth ground system constraints, including staffing schedules, operations planning across time zones, and more. To address these telecommunication challenges, the Mars Asset Relay Mission Link Allocation Design Environment (MARMLADE) tool was developed. It is a MATLAB-based tool to assign orbiter passes or Direct-From-Earth (DFE) links to each of the three surface assets and quantify the operational efficiency of each surface asset.MARMLADE uses a data set of simulated Mars relay orbiter geometry and telecommunication capabilities provided by JPL’s Telecom Orbit Analysis and Simulation Tool (TOAST) software to compute which asset should get each pass based on a series of heuristics and predictions of all assets’ states. Within MARMLADE, the user can provide inputs including the option for time-based pass splitting, fixed FWD data rate capabilities, DFE communication capabilities, and link parameters allowing for the assessment of complex operations and hardware trades using surface mission operational efficiency as a primary figure of merit. As the MSR mission concepts continue to mature, MARMLADE is being used to assess ability of all MSR elements to meet the surface mission timeline requirements and to provide relay link allocations to each of the MSR surface assets.This paper will describe the motivation and design of the MARMLADE tool and how it is being used to perform campaign and mission level trades, generate requirements, and support development of the MSR surface mission scenarios."

To support these capabilities, increasingly autonomous flight systems are required that can perform dedicated mission functions, e.g. payload targeting and communications, and system-level functions, e.g. planning and goal monitoring. Architecting an autonomous system requires a well-reasoned, self-consistent framework to avoid \textit{ad hoc} design choices that will introduce complexity and risk. The Framework for Robust Execution and Scheduling of Commands On-Board, FRESCO, is the result of lessons learned in developing a software architecture to enable autonomous solar system exploration. FRESCO generalizes this work to offer a modular, software-agnostic approach to developing verifiable architecture for autonomous space systems. FRESCO specifies guiding principles, functions, interfaces, and interactions from which mission-specific autonomous control architectures can be derived. FRESCO is a principled framework relying on explicit, state-based goal definitions, centralized management of state knowledge, clearly separated control boundaries, and hierarchical reasoning. Using components from FRESCO reference architecture, an autonomous decision-making architecture can be designed for spacecraft which can then be mapped to flight software architecture. FRESCO is flexibly defined to enable autonomous control of flight systems built using extensive software and hardware heritage. Finally, FRESCO-derived architectures support a spectrum of operator/spacecraft interactions, ranging from traditional commanding to goal-driven commanding with the ability to change mission goals autonomously. FRESCO has been used in defining the autonomy architectures for the ASTERIA mission and have been demonstrated in laboratory and software simulation for small body rendezvous and in-space servicing missions."

A rapidly rising number of spacecraft and increasingly complex scientific instruments with higher bandwidth requirements have resulted in demand that exceeds the network’s capacity across its 12 antennae. The existing DSN scheduling process operates on a rolling weekly basis and is time-consuming; for a given week, generation of the final baseline schedule of spacecraft tracking passes takes roughly 5 months from the initial requirements submission deadline, with several weeks of peer-to-peer negotiations in between. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to generate candidate DSN schedules from mission requests and spacecraft ephemeris data with demonstrated capability to address real-world operational constraints. A deep RL agent is developed that takes mission requests for a given week as input, and interacts with a DSN scheduling environment to allocate tracks such that its reward signal is maximized. A comparison is made between an agent trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and its random, untrained counterpart. The results represent a proof-of-concept that, given a well-shaped reward signal, a deep RL agent can learn the complex heuristics used by experts to schedule the DSN. A trained agent can potentially be used to generate candidate schedules to bootstrap the scheduling process and thus reduce the turnaround cycle for DSN scheduling."

As plans for new, exciting exploration missions to the Moon, Mars and other planetary bodies are being developed, there is a need for a new generation of TDRs that are smaller, consume less power and are less expensive than previous sensors. The challenge of designing such a landing sensor is twofold: the first is to have well-vetted software tools that allow us to explore the design space for a particular mission scenario and analyze performance of relevant radar architectures. The second challenge is to reduce mass and power requirements of a landing radar without compromising reliability and performance. New design approaches that address these challenges need to be tested and demonstrated in realistic Entry-Descent-Landing (EDL)/Deorbit-Descent-Landing (DDL) scenarios. In this paper, we describe a TDR testbed developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The testbed is a closed-loop design, analysis and verification capability used to design and evaluate the next generation of landing radars for a variety of EDL/DDL scenarios."

These events last,  on average, about 30 minutes and range in size from meters to hundreds of  meters in diameter. Designing low-cost missions that will improve our  knowledge of dust devil formation and evolution, and their connection to  atmospheric dynamics and the dust cycle, is fundamental to informing future  crewed Mars lander missions about surface conditions. In this paper we  present a mission for a constellation of low orbiting Mars cubesats, each carrying imagers with agile pointing capabilities. The goal is  to maximize the number of dust devil follow-up observations through  real-time, on-board scheduling. We study scenarios where cubesats are  equipped with a 2.5 degree boresight angle camera that accommodates five slew  positions (including nadir). We assume a concept of operations where the  cubesats autonomously survey the surface of Mars and can autonomously detect  dust devils from their surface imagery. When a dust devil is detected, the  constellation is autonomously re-tasked through an on-board distributed  scheduler to capture as many follow-on images of the event as possible, so as  to study its evolution. The cubesat orbits are propagated assuming two-body  dynamics and the ground tracks and camera field of view are computed assuming  a spherical Mars. Realistic inter-agent communication link opportunities are  computed and included in our optimization, which allow for real-time event  detection information to be shared within the constellation.  We compare against a powerful ``omniscient'' mission which has a priori  knowledge of all dust devil activity to show the gap between predicted  performance and the best possible outcome. In particular, we show that the  communications are especially important for acquiring follow-up observations,  and that a realistic distributed scheduling mechanism is sufficient to  capture nearly all dust devil observations that are possible for a given  orbit configuration."

Volatiles include elements that do not interact strongly with the surface, such as neon (detected on the Moon) and helium (detected both on the Moon and at Mercury), but also argon, a noble gas (detected on the Moon) that surprisingly adsorbs at the cold lunar nighttime surface. Refractories include species such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and aluminum, all of which have very strong bonds with the lunar surface and thus need energetic processes to be ejected into the exosphere. Here we focus on the properties of species that have been detected in the exospheres of inner Solar System bodies, specifically the Moon and Mercury, and how they provide important information to understand source and loss processes of these exospheres, as well as their dependence on variations in external drivers."

Previous studies using data from (a) a tropical coastal location, (b) a mid-latitude continental location with semi-arid climate, and (c) a sub-tropical continental location, found that the two rain types could be separated in the NW–Dm space, where Dm is the mass-weighted mean diameter and NW is the normalized intercept parameter. In this paper, we investigate the same separation technique using data and observations from a mid-latitude coastal region. Three-minute DSDs from disdrometer measurements are used for the NW- versus Dm-based classification and are compared with simultaneous observations from an S-band polarimetric radar 38 km away from the disdrometer site. Specifically, RHI (range-height indicator) scans over the disdrometer were used for confirmation. Results show that there was no need to modify the separation criteria from previous studies. Three-minute DSDs from the same location were used as input to scattering calculations to derive retrieval equations for NW and Dm for the S-band radar using an improved technique and applied to the RHI scans to identify convective and stratiform rain regions. Two events are shown as illustrative examples."
1977,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220004054,2023-08-03,On the effects of the ocean on atmospheric CFC-11 lifetimes and emissions,"The ocean is a reservoir for CFC-11, a major ozone-depleting chemical. Anthropogenic production of CFC-11 dramatically decreased in the 1990s under the Montreal Protocol, which stipulated a global phase out of production by 2010. However, studies raise questions about current overall emission levels and indicate unexpected increases of CFC-11 emissions of about 10 Gg/yr after 2013 (based upon measured atmospheric concentrations and an assumed atmospheric lifetime). These findings heighten the need to understand processes that could affect the CFC-11 lifetime, including ocean fluxes. We evaluate how ocean uptake and release through 2300 affects CFC-11 lifetimes, emission estimates, and the long-term return of CFC-11 from the ocean reservoir. We show that ocean uptake yields a shorter total lifetime and larger inferred emission of atmospheric CFC-11 from 1930 to 2075 compared to estimates using only atmospheric processes. Ocean flux changes over time result in small but not completely negligible effects on the calculated unexpected emissions change (decreasing it by 0.4 ± 0.3 Gg/yr). Moreover, it is expected that the ocean will eventually become a source of CFC-11, increasing its total lifetime thereafter. Ocean outgassing should produce detectable increases in global atmospheric CFC-11 abundances by the mid-2100s, with emission of around 0.5 Gg/yr; this should not be confused with illicit production at that time. An illustrative model projection suggests that climate change is expected to make the ocean a weaker reservoir for CFC-11, advancing the detectable change in the global atmospheric mixing ratio by about 5 yr."

There is also an environmental impact from this: CO2 emissions from commercial passenger and freight operations totaled 918 Mt in 2018 (ICCT, 2019), or around 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Passenger transport accounted for 81% of the total. Emissions from aviation have grown 32% over the past five years. Coupled with this aspect, there is a continuous and growing need to satisfy ever-growing electrical power needs on commercial and military aircraft. All the armed services (Army, Navy, and Air Force) are continuously trying to enhance UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) endurance and range across a broad fleet of different aircraft. The commercial Boeing 787 requires about 1.2MWe and that is expected to grow. Current technologies used to supply increased on-board electrical power are generally: 1) “burn more fuel and convert through on-board generators” and 2) use additional heavy (i.e., weight-inefficient) and sometimes unsafe battery systems on-board the aircraft. The aircraft industry is seeking new, innovative ways to satisfy this increasing power demand. One as-yet-untapped power source is the enormous amount of “waste” thermal energy flowing out the jet engine exhaust; some estimates in smaller “by-pass” flow jet engines is several hundreds of kilowatts (e.g., Pratt & Whitney Canada PW545B turbofan). This quantity is much higher in large jet engines associated with commercial aircraft. This large waste thermal energy manifests itself in large temperature differences within the by-pass-flow engine exhaust system relative to outside ambient conditions, because of the actual by-pass engine design configuration. There is strong need to develop thermal technologies and systems that could harness and convert at least a portion of this thermal energy into useful electrical energy to satisfy growing on-board electrical needs. In addition, there is a strong desire within the aircraft and engine manufacturing community to reduce the “carbon footprint” of the industry though reduced fuel usage worldwide. NASA has a robust aircraft electrification program to meet these desires and support industry in its aircraft electrification objectives. This program is integrating thermoacoustic systems, advanced lightweight heat exchanger technology, and advanced heat pipe technology to capture and transport large amounts of engine waste thermal energy for on-board power conversion, advanced heat-pump cooling, and exergy enhancement (i.e., temperature lift). Advanced lightweight heat exchangers are envisioned to capture engine exhaust thermal energy at approximately 673 K and deliver it to efficient thermoacoustic power conversion systems operating at temperature ratios (Thot/Tcold) > 1.6. Advanced heat pipe systems are envisioned to transport thermal energy from low temperature sources, through thermoacoustic heat pumps, to high temperature needs such as wing anti-icing, fuel pre-heating, and combustion air pre-heating. The paper will discuss the current state-of-the-art, objectives, system design architecture, and remaining technical challenges in system formulation within the NASA aircraft electrification program."

The presented radar system uses an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) to directly produce the frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) chirp waveform. To address the key challenges of Tx-to-Rx leakage and surface reflections, the system uses a second AWG channel coupled directly to the receiver that provides a cancellation waveform to mitigate the unwanted signals. The system also uses a genetic algorithm AI engine which assesses the radar IF and iteratively improves the parameters of the cancellation waveform injected at the receiver."

The thruster was operated for a total of 3,287 h, of which 97.9% was spent at 300 V – 1000 W, and generated 790 kN-s of total impulse. Thrust, telemetry, and temperature measurements periodically recorded at four operating conditions spanning 200 – 500 V and 200 – 1000 W revealed constant performance across the full test duration. High-fidelity plasma simulations of the erosion of the thruster’s downstream faces suggest a theoretical lifetime capability of >30 kh, corresponding to propellant throughput of >450 kg Xe and a total impulse of >7 MNs, at the 300 V – 1000 W operating condition. The test was voluntarily paused after 50 kg Xe throughput to take these erosion measurements before the test was resumed at a different operating condition."

Furthermore, geographic distri- butions of expected clinical severity of COVID-19 may be closely linked to prior history of respiratory diseases and changes in humidity, tem- perature, and air quality. In this context, we postulate that by tracking topological features of atmospheric conditions over time, we can provide a quanti?able structural distribution of atmospheric changes that are likely to be related to COVID-19 dynamics. As such, we apply the machinery of persistence homology on time series of graphs to extract topological signatures and to follow geographical changes in relative humidity and temperature. We develop an integrative machine learning framework named Topological Lifespan LSTM (TLife-LSTM) and test its predictive capabilities on forecasting the dynamics of SARS-CoV2 cases. We validate our framework using the number of con?rmed cases and hospitalization rates recorded in the states of Washington and California in the USA. Our results demonstrate the predictive potential of TLife-LSTM in forecasting the dynamics of COVID-19 and modeling its complex spatio-temporal spread dynamics."

Key to the success of the ECOSTRESS mission has been the use of automated scheduling in mission analysis pre-launch, and in successful operations where automated scheduling was deployed to address several operational challenges. ECOSTRESS uses an adaptation of the Compressed Large-scale Activity Scheduling and Planning (CLASP) system to automatically select science observations respecting area and point target priorities as well as visibility, illumination, onboard storage, and radiation constraints to satisfy high-level prioritized science campaigns. The ECOSTRESS scheduler was used pre-launch to predict the effectiveness of alternative formulations of science campaign definitions accounting for the impact of data volume, keepout, and orbit/illumination/visibility constraints to derive the initial operational science campaign definitions and priorities. The scheduler was then used after instrument checkout for operations. ECOSTRESS has faced multiple operational challenges relating to instrument firmware and hardware, and the scheduler has been updated several times to address these challenges. The instrument Mass Storage Units (MSUs) had operational issues, requiring the scheduler to plan for and schedule commands to handle intricacies of data management. After many months of operations, both MSUs on the instrument became non-functioning and the firmware of the instrument was updated to bypass the MSUs.  A further update to the ECOSTRESS scheduler enabled the scheduler to operate in this new operations mode. The ECOSTRESS scheduler has also been updated to improve handling of along-track uncertainty inherent in International Space Station operations. The flexibility and ease of updating of the automated scheduler has been a significant contributor to successful operations of the ECOSTRESS mission."

The Planetary Radar and Radio Science group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has been involved in many planetary bistatic radar experiments since the 1970’s using orbiters and Deep Space Network (DSN) antennas. The recent advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technologies are making the UAVs more popular in scientific surveying applications. One such application is the use of UAVs in bistatic radar measurements to explore surfaces on Earth. Our analyses show that UAV-based bistatic radar measurements will improve our understanding of the finer-scale characteristic variations of the surface by acquiring the higher resolution data for a specific region of interest compared to data obtained from a spacecraft. The Mars helicopter, a technology demonstration to test the first powered flight on Mars, will be the beginning of a new era of exploration with UAVs on Mars. This leap in planetary UAV technology has renewed the importance of developing a miniaturized bistatic radar instrument (under 1 kg) compatible with a UAV platform able to meet the science requirements for studying surfaces on Earth, Mars, and other planetary bodies. As part of a task at JPL, we have been working on a technology demonstration using a compact bistatic radar instrument designed to be the payload of a UAV employing signals of opportunity from Earth’s orbiters, i.e. Global Positioning System (GPS). In this paper, we present our design and development of the instrument, our evaluation of different L-band antennas, the performance of compact open-loop receivers in support of Earth and planetary bistatic radar observations, and the instrument fit test on an UAV platform. As part of this publication, we also highlight the results of a field experiment dedicated to test the sensitivity of the miniaturized bistatic radar instrument to different electrical properties of the surface."

After the SMAP L1B_TB data product version 4 was released in 2018, the radiometer has undergone further calibration and validation. The goal is to reduce the difference between antenna temperature of ascending and descending orbits during the eclipse, and to reduce the dips in the calibration drift over the cold sky (CS) during the eclipse seasons in 2017 and 2018. The postlaunch calibration algorithm has been revisited by retrieving all of the calibration parameters simultaneously with two different options for the hot calibration source (the global ocean, or the radiometer internal reference load). The performance of the two options are compared here. The option with the radiometer internal reference load has been chosen by the SMAP science team for data release version 5. In addition, a correction offset is applied to the input signal to account for offsets during the early-mission stages with the SMAP synthetic aperture radar transmitter operating alongside the radiometer."
1996,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220007501,2023-08-03,Improving Cross-track Scanning Radiometers’ Precipitation Retrieval over Ocean by Morphing,"Previous studies showed that conical scanning radiometers greatly outperform cross-track scanning radiometers for precipitation retrieval over ocean. This study demonstrates a novel approach to improve precipitation rates at the cross-track scanning radiometers’ observation time by propagating the conical scanning radiometers’ retrievals to the cross-track scanning radiometers’ observation time. The improved precipitation rate is a weighted average of original cross-track radiometers’ retrievals and retrievals propagated from a conical scanning radiometer. The cross-track scanning radiometers include the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) on board the SNPP satellite and four Microwave Humidity Sounders (MHSs). The conical scanning radiometers include the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and three Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounders (SSMISs), while the precipitation retrievals from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) are taken as the reference. Results show that the morphed precipitation rates agree much better with the reference. The degree of improvement depends on several factors, including the propagated precipitation source, the time interval between the cross-track scanning radiometer and the conical scanning radiometer, the precipitation type (convective versus stratiform), the precipitation events’ size, and the geolocation. The study has potential to greatly improve high-impact weather systems monitoring (e.g., hurricanes) and multisatellite precipitation products. It may also enhance the usefulness of future satellite missions with cross-track scanning radiometers on board."
1997,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220008848,2023-08-03,A Critical Look at Coulomb Counting Approach for State of Charge Estimation in Batteries,"In this paper, we consider the problem of state-of-charge estimation for rechargeable batteries. Coulomb counting is a well-known method for estimating the state of charge, and it is regarded as accurate as long as the battery capacity and the beginning state of charge are known. The Coulomb counting approach, on the other hand, is prone to inaccuracies from a variety of sources, and the magnitude of these errors has not been explored in the literature. We formally construct and quantify the state-of-charge estimate error during Coulomb counting due to four types of error sources: (1) current measurement error; (2) current integration approximation error; (3) battery capacity uncertainty; and (4) timing oscillator error/drift. It is demonstrated that the state-of-charge error produced can be either time-cumulative or state-of-charge-proportional. Time-cumulative errors accumulate over time and have the potential to render the state-of-charge estimation utterly invalid in the long term. The proportional errors of the state of charge rise with the accumulated state of charge and reach their worst value within one charge/discharge cycle. The study presents methods for reducing time-cumulative and state-of-charge-proportional mistakes through simulation analysis."

The  methodology  is based on a one-dimensional (1D) Newmark-type  sliding block model to assess instability  and a spatial  projection  in  3D  topography  to  derive  landslide  geometry.  The  strength  parameters  for modeled landslides that best match the landslide location, area, and volume were derived through an  iterative  scheme  that  optimizes  the  match  using  predefined  matching  criteria.  The  range  of different-sized landslides produced shear strength estimates from ~10 to 300 kPa and led to the derivation of a regionally averaged strength envelope characterized by a cohesion of 6 kPa and a friction  angle  of  53°for  the  highly  fractured  limestones  that  are  encountered  in  this  area. Compared  to  previous  full 3Dslope  stability  analyses  in  this  area,  the  friction  angle  using this methodology  was  found  to  be  generally  consistent,  but  the  cohesion  was  lower.  The  presented methodology  can  provide  a  computationally  efficient  method  to  estimate  the  average  shear strength of a geologic unit over large areas, especially where extensive field and laboratory tests on the materials are unavailable or difficult to conduct."

2031,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220010707,2023-08-03,A Geodetic and Positioning Thematic Layer - Identifying tools to connect the GGRF and IGIF,"Effective and sustainable modernization of a nation’s geodetic framework relies on the ability of the relevant organizations and other stakeholders to communicate, integrate, and align both their strategic objectives and operational planning with the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN GGIM) Sub-Committee on Geodesy’s (SCoG) roadmap for a Global Geodetic Reference Frame (GGRF) for Sustainable Development. In addition, to implement geodetic modernization initiatives through multiple government agencies, a holistic country action plan (CAP) for geospatial information management must incorporate pertinent geodetic outcomes and outputs. Presently, the CAP framework and principles used by nations is the UN GGIM Integrated Geospatial Information Framework (IGIF).  From engagement with geospatial and survey communities across emerging nations in the Asia Pacific region, it is evident more assistance and coordination is necessary to articulate, integrate and connect geodetic organizational strategies with the requirements of the GGRF roadmap; the strategic pathways of the IGIF; and resourcing for a meaningful and relevant multi-faceted CAP. One of the supporting mechanisms for such planning or preparation, which representatives of the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG) Asia Pacific Capacity Development Network (AP CDN) and the UN SCoG Education, Training and Capacity Building (ETCB) working group are considering, is a policy framework and guide for a “Geodetic and Positioning Thematic Layer” (GPTL). Essentially, this “thematic layer”, in terms of the GGRF and IGIF, aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of, and a toolbox for, the “why, what, how, and who” of geodesy and positioning. This discussion paper will provide background and insights for a GPTL dedicated to recognizing, and aligning the geodetic capacity development needs with broader geospatial information management issues and applications. The paper will also outline a rigorous, participatory, and inclusive consultation process for the design and development of a thematic layer. Furthermore, as the intention of the authors is to prepare a forthcoming “white paper” that will concisely describe the issues of a GPTL and initiatives for an appropriate guide and/or policy framework, this paper will seek feedback on: the potential scientific, social, environmental and political benefits of modernizing geodetic infrastructure and systems; the challenges associated with the GGRF roadmap; leveraging the geodesy-relevant elements of each IGIF strategic pathway; the importance of collaborative efforts; and the capacity development needs and resources in relation to governance, technology and people."
2032,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220014574,2023-08-03,Deriving Mercury Geodetic Parameters with Altimetric Crossovers from the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA),"Based on the previous applications of laser altimetry to planetary geodesy at GSFC, we use the recently developed PyXover software package to analyze altimetric crossovers from the Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA). Using PyXover, we place new constraints on Mercury's geodetic parameters via least squares minimization of crossover discrepancies. We simultaneously solve for orbital corrections for each MLA ground track, for the geodetic parameters of the International Astronomical Union-recommended orientation model for Mercury (pole right-ascension and declination coordinates, prime meridian rotation rate, and librations), and for the Mercury's Love number h2. We calibrate the formal errors of our solution based on closed-loop simulations and on the level of robustness against a priori values, data selection, and parametrization. Our solution of the Mercury's rotational parameters is consistent with published values. In particular, our new estimate for the orientation of the pole places Mercury in a Cassini state, with an obliquity ϵ = 2.031 ± 0.03 arcmin compatible with previous “surface” related measurements. Moreover, we provide a first data-based estimate of the Love number h_(2) = 1.55 ± 0.65. The latter is consistent with expectations from models of Mercury's interior, although its precision does not enable their refinement."
2033,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220015646,2023-08-03,Trend Detection of Atmospheric Time Series: Incorporating Appropriate Uncertainty Estimates and Handling Extreme Events,"This paper is aimed at atmospheric scientists without formal training in statistical theory. Its goal is to, 1) provide a critical review of the rationale for trend analysis of the time series typically encountered in the field of atmospheric chemistry; 2) describe a range of trend-detection methods; and 3) demonstrate effective means of conveying the results to a general audience. Trend detections in atmospheric chemical composition data are often challenged by a variety of sources of uncertainty, which often behave differently to other environmental phenomena such as temperature, precipitation rate, or stream flow, and may require specific methods depending on the science questions to be addressed. Some sources of uncertainty can be explicitly included in the model specification, such as autocorrelation and seasonality, but some inherent uncertainties are difficult to quantify, such as data heterogeneity and measurement uncertainty due to the combined effect of short- and long-term natural variability, instrumental stability, and aggregation of data from sparse sampling frequency. Failure to account for these uncertainties might result in an inappropriate inference of the trends and their estimation errors. On the other hand, the variation in extreme events might be interesting for different scientific questions, for example, the frequency of extremely high surface ozone events and their relevance to human health. In this study we aim to, 1) review trend detection methods for addressing different levels of data complexity in different chemical species; 2) demonstrate that the incorporation of scientifically interpretable covariates can outperform pure numerical curve fitting techniques in terms of uncertainty reduction and improved predictability; 3) illustrate the study of trends based on extreme quantiles that can provide insight beyond standard mean or median based trend estimates; and 4) present an advanced method of quantifying regional trends based on the inter-site correlations of multi-site data. All demonstrations are based on time series of observed trace gases relevant to atmospheric chemistry, but the methods can be applied to other environmental data sets."

Researchers with NASA’s Cold Atom Lab (CAL) have now simultaneously produced gases of two atomic species (rubidium and potassium) in a uniquely quantum (wave-like) phase of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for the first time in space. CAL scientists are using the unique micro gravity environment onboard the International Space Station to study interactions, molecule formation, and the emergence of structure and complexity in these coexisting dual-species gases at unprecedented low temperatures, for long times in free fall, and specifically in the absence of the perturbing force of gravity."

Here, we use a range of CMIP6 greenhouse warming experiments to assess the recent and future evolution of the equatorial Pacific east-west temperature gradient and corresponding Walker circulation. In abrupt CO2-increase scenarios many models generate an initial strengthening of this gradient resembling an ocean thermostat (OT), followed by a small weakening; other models generate an immediate weakening that becomes progressively stronger establishing a pronounced eastern equatorial Pacific (EP) warming pattern. The initial response in these experiments is a strong predictor for the future EP pattern simulated in both abrupt and realistic warming scenarios, but not in historical simulations showing no multi-model trend. The likely explanation is that the recent CO2-driven changes in the tropical Pacific are masked by aerosol effects and a potential OT-related delay, while the EP warming pattern will emerge as greenhouse gases overcome aerosol forcing."
2036,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230000910,2023-08-03,Resilient Space Habitat Design Using Safety Controls,"Space habitats will involve a complex and tightly coupled combination of hardware, software, and humans, while operating in challenging environments that pose many risks, both known and unknown. It will not be possible to design habitats that are immune to failure, nor will it be possible to foresee all possible failures. Rather than aiming for designs where ―failure is not an option,‖ habitats must be resilient to disruptions. We propose an approach to resilient design for space habitats based on the concept of safety controls from system safety engineering. We model disruptions using a state-and-trigger approach, where the space habitat is in one of three distinct states at each time instance: nominal, hazardous, or accident. We use safety controls as ways of preventing a system from entering or remaining in a hazardous or accident state. We develop a safety control option space for the habitat, from which designers can select the set of safety controls that best meet resilience, performance, and other system goals. The safety control option space is likely to be large, accordingly, we design a database that links safety controls to the applicable states and triggers. We demonstrate our approach on the early design stage of a Martian space habitat."
2037,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230000911,2023-08-03,Role of Cyber-Physical Testing in Developing Resilient Extraterrestrial Habitats,"Extraterrestrial long-term habitat systems (henceforth referred to as habitat systems) require groundbreaking technological advances to overcome the extreme demands introduced by isolation and challenging environments. A habitat system must operate as intended under continuous disruptive conditions. Designing for the demands that challenging environments will place on habitat systems (e.g., wild temperature fluctuations, galactic cosmic rays, destructive dust, meteoroid impacts, vibrations, and solar particle events) represents one of the greatest challenges in this endeavor. This engineering problem necessitates that we design and manage habitat systems to be resilient. System resilience requires a comprehensive approach that accounts for disruptions through the design process and adapts to them in operation. As the habitat system evolves—growing in physical size, complexity, population, and connectivity—and diversifies in operations, it must continue to be safe and resilient. In this endeavor, we should take advantage of lessons learned in developing civil infrastructure responsive to catastrophic natural hazards, autonomous robotics platforms, smart buildings, cyber-physical testing, complex systems, and diagnostics and prognostics for intelligent health management. This study highlights the importance of system resilience and cyber-physical testing to address the grand challenge of developing habitat systems."

The measurements reveal significant daily variations over dayside low latitudes, yielding about 10-20% standard deviation in equinoxes, 20-30% in solstices, reaching 40-50% in winter. The nighttime deviations could be 30-60%, being largest in solstices. Day-to-day variations are also observed in the longitudinal wave-4 structures. The period mostly remained geomagnetically quiet except for some moderate disturbances on a few days. Tidal decomposition of the GIS electron density shows that in-situ forced migrating diurnal (DW1) terdiurnal (TW3) oscillations and the background zonal mean yield only ~25% of the daily variations despite accounting for almost 75-90% of the observed electron density. Thus, forcing from lower atmosphere dominates the contribution (~75%) to the observed daily variations. Only about one third of this lower atmospheric forcing comes from the migrating semidiurnal SW2 and the usually investigated non-migrating diurnal eastward DE2, DE3, stationary planetary wave SPW3, SPW4, and semidiurnal eastward SE1, and SE2 components. The residual tides other than those mentioned above, including secondary waves through non-linear interactions and other planetary waves, thus significantly influence the day-to-day variations in electron density and modify the longitudinal wave structures."
2039,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230002477,2023-08-03,Geological Factors Impacted Cadmium Availability and use as an Alternative Cofactor for Zinc in the Carbon Fixation Pathways of Marine Diatoms,"Transition metal cofactors are crucial for many biological processes. Despite being primarily considered to be toxic, the transition metal cadmium (Cd) was discovered to be a substitute cofactor for zinc (Zn) in photosynthetic carbon fixation pathways of marine diatoms. However, it is not known how conditions in the geosphere impacted Cd availability and its incorporation as an alternative metal cofactor for phytoplankton. We employed mineral chemistry network analysis to investigate which geochemical factors may have influenced the availability of Cd and Zn during the putative time period that the alternative Cd-based pathway evolved. Our results show that Zn minerals are more chemically diverse than are Cd minerals, but Zn- and Cd-containing minerals have similar network centrality values when specifically considering sulfur (S)-containing species. Cadmium and Zn sulfides are the most common Cd- and Zn-containing mineral species over the past 500 million years. In particular, the Cd and Zn sulfides, respectively greenockite and sphalerite, were highly abundant during this time period. Furthermore, S-containing Cd and Zn minerals are commonly co-located in geologic time, allowing them to be weathered and transported to the ocean in tandem, rather than from separate sources. We suggest that the simultaneous weathering of Cd and Zn sulfides allowed for Cd to be a bioavailable direct substitute for Zn in protein complexes during periods of Zn depletion. The biogeochemical cycles of Zn and Cd exemplify the importance of the coevolution of the geosphere and biosphere in shaping primary production in the modern ocean."

However, sSNVs can have significant biological impact and may lead to disease. Existing computational methods for evaluating the effect of sSNVs suffer from the lack of gold-standard training/evaluation data and exhibit over-reliance on sequence conservation signals. We developed synVep (synonymous Variant effect predictor), a machine learning-based method that overcomes both of these limitations. Our training data was a combination of variants reported by gnomAD (observed) and those unreported, but possible in the human genome (generated). We used positive-unlabeled learning to purify the generated variant set of any likely unobservable variants. We then trained two sequential extreme gradient boosting models to identify subsets of the remaining variants putatively enriched and depleted in effect. Our method attained 90% precision/recall on a previously unseen set of variants. Furthermore, although synVep does not explicitly use conservation, its scores correlated with evolutionary distances between orthologs in cross-species variation analysis. synVep was also able to differentiate pathogenic vs. benign variants, as well as splice-site disrupting variants (SDV) vs. non-SDVs. Thus, synVep provides an important improvement in annotation of sSNVs, allowing users to focus on variants that most likely harbor effects."

Together with archival observations, including HST/NICMOS using the F160W filter and Very Large Telescope/SPHERE at the H-band in polarized light, we investigate the system in scattered light. By studying this nearly face-on system using geometric disk models and Henyey–Greenstein phase functions, we report a new discovery of a tertiary ring and a clump. We identify a layered architecture: three rings, a spiral, and an ≈150 au<sup>2</sup> elliptical clump. The most extended ring peaks at 28 au, and the other components are on its outskirts. Our point-source detection-limit calculations demonstrate the necessity of disk modeling in imaging fainter planets. Morphologically, we witness a clockwise spiral motion, and the motion pattern is consistent with both solid body motion and local Keplerian motion; we also observe underdensity regions for the secondary ring that might result from mean-motion resonance or moving shadows: both call for re-observations to determine their nature. Comparing multi-instrument observations, we obtain blue STIS-NICMOS color, a STIS-SPHERE radial distribution peak difference for the tertiary ring, and a high SPHERE-NICMOS polarization fraction; these aspects indicate that TWA 7 could retain small dust particles. By viewing the debris disk around M star TWA 7 at a nearly face-on vantage point, our study allows for the understanding of such disks in scattered light in both system architecture and dust property."

A report on the science and feasibility of such a mission was recently submitted to NASA as a probe study concept. The driving objective of the concept is to determine whether Earth-like exoplanets exist in the HZs of the nearest sunlike stars and have biosignature gases in their atmospheres. With the sensitivity provided by this telescope, it is possible to measure the brightness of zodiacal dust disks around the nearest sunlike stars and establish how their population compares with our own. In addition, known gas-giant exoplanets can be targeted to measure their atmospheric metallicity and thereby determine if the correlation with planet mass follows the trend observed in the Solar System and hinted at by exoplanet transit spectroscopy data. We provide the details of the calculations used to estimate the sensitivity of Roman with a starshade and describe the publicly available Python-based source code used to make these calculations. Given the fixed capability of Roman and the constrained observing windows inherent for the starshade, we calculate the sensitivity of the combined observatory to detect these three types of targets, and we present an overall observing strategy that enables us to achieve these objectives."

The redundant Rover Compute Element (RCE-A, B) has experienced an inability to mount the flash memory several times. The leading cause of these anomalies is likely the loss of electrical connectivity, which is theorized to be due to cracks on the memory component solder joints by thermal cycle fatigue. To investigate this theory, the number of thermal cycles accumulated in flight was compared to PQV accelerated thermal cycle life test data. The goal of this study was to inform mission operations of the risk associated with thermal cycling damage on the RCE. However, since the RCE-B does not have continuous temperature data from the Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PRT) closest to the flash memory, a model was made to correlate continuous data from two other nearby sensors on the RCE-B to the noncontiguous sensor. Using the Rainflow Counting Algorithm, the reconstituted data was converted into the number of equivalent thermal cycles. The Coffin-Manson Equation was used to compare flight thermal cycles to the PQV test. The accelerated life test showed cracking on the memory component solder joints after 500 cycles of 80°C temperature excursions. This study found that the RCE-A and RCE-B have undergone an equivalent of 144 and 430 cycles of 80°C temperature excursions during flight, respectively."

The techniques include Ridge Regression, Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM), Classification Neural Network (CNN), Autoencoder Classification Neural Network (ACNN), and LSTM Autoencoder Classification Neural Network (LACNN). These techniques were tested with the rate of total electron content (TEC) index (ROTI) data collected during 2008 and 2009 from a geodetic station in Fairbanks, Alaska (64.98°N, 147.50°W), which is in the auroral zone. Using ROTI data with the ML techniques, experiments were conducted to reach two goals: (1) examine what space weather measurements present good correlation with ROTI so that they may be helpful in ML-based prediction of ionospheric irregularities in the polar region; (2) predict ROTI hours and days ahead by training the neural network models with historical ROTI data alone. The Ridge Regression experiments indicate that a combination of measurements of local geomagnetic horizontal components, geomagnetic SYM-H index, 3-hour Kp and ap indices, and F10.7 solar flux index appears to be more correlated to the single-site ROTI measurements than other parameters. The neural network (NN) experiments show that although the LACNN model allows for predictions of non-irregularity and irregularity conditions defined by ROTI levels up to 3 hours in advance, with an overall accuracy ≥ 92%, a number of irregularity events can still be missed. Hence, further development is needed to reduce the number of missed events. In this paper, the models, data processing, model performance, prediction results, and potential applications are presented."

Traditionally, power-hungry and bulky motors are used to mechanically scan the antenna beam. At lower-frequencies, phased array antennas are most commonly used where low-loss phase shifters are used with the array elements to accomplish beam steering. However, development of similar phased array antennas at submillimeter-waves has been challenging. Recently, we have developed a low-loss microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based phased shifter in the 500-750 GHz band. In this work, we present a submillimeter-wave phased array antenna system with a cavity-backed double slot antenna architecture using the MEMS-based phase shifters. To demonstrate the concept, we developed two arrays: first one is a 8×1 linear antenna array with a fixed waveguide feeding network that achieved ±20◦ beam scanning, 18 dB directivity, and less than 1 dB scan loss over the design frequency of 500–570 GHz. The second one is a 4 × 1 linear antenna array with integrated MEMS-based phase shifters on each array element, achieving 15 dB directivity and capable of dynamic beam scanning over a range of ±9 ◦ . All the plots presented are simulated results since the parts are currently being fabricated. We hope to have access to our assembly and measurement facilities over the next few months and present measured performances at the conference."

Currently, those binary stars are not included in the Roman Space Telescope Coronagraph Instrument target list, but they could be observed if high-contrast imaging around binary star systems using Roman was possible. The Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC) algorithm can be used to suppress companion star leakage. If the targets have angular separations larger than the Nyquist controllable region of the Deformable Mirror, MSWC must operate in its Super-Nyquist (SN) mode. This mode requires a target star replica within the SN region in order to provide the ability to null speckles at SN angular separations. For the case of Roman, more than half of the targets that can be observed using MSWC, including Alpha Centauri, have angular separations larger than the Nyquist controllable region of the 48x48 actuator Deformable Mirror (DM) to be used. In this paper, we describe how super-Nyquist MSWC can be implemented in Roman CGI adding a mild grating on a replica of the Wide-field Shaped Pupil mask, which would use a spare space in the Shaped Pupil Active Mechanism. We present the feasibility analysis, simulation results, and discuss the latest results on MSWC experiment from three different laboratories at NASA Ames, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Subaru telescope."

The Roman Coronagraph will be capable of detecting and characterizing exoplanets and circumstellar disks in visible light at an unprecedented contrast level of ~10-8 or lower. Such a contrast level, which is several magnitudes better than state-of-the-art visible or near-infrared coronagraphs, raises entirely new challenges that will be overcome using a combination of hardware, calibration and data processing. In particular, the Roman Coronagraph will be the first space-based coronagraphic instrument with real-time active wavefront control through the use of large format deformable mirrors, and its EMCCD detector will enable faint signal detection in photon-counting mode. The Roman Coronagraph passed its critical design review successfully in April 2021, and is now well on its path to demonstrate many core technologies at the levels required for future exo-Earth direct imaging missions."

All primary propulsion will be done with the flight-proven SPT-140 electric propulsion subsystem. The Psyche mission will feature the first use of Hall thrusters for a NASA mission, and the first use of Hall thrusters beyond cis-lunar space, which has presented some unique challenges. In this paper we describe the Psyche propellant feed system architecture, expected propellant usage for the mission, propellant gauging requirements, and challenges associated with propellant gauging. Data from two recent Maxar electric orbit-raising missions with SPT-140 thrusters are reviewed and used to assess in-flight performance. We develop a pressure-volume-temperature gauging method that incorporates the propellant temperature distributions observed in the flight data, and use this method to provide an improved quantitative understanding of in-flight propellant consumption rates and their uncertainties. The results are in excellent agreement with the results of standard Maxar gauging methods and we determine a propellant usage uncertainty of ± 7.1% 3σ based on flight telemetry. Additionally, we demonstrate that the bookkeeping method of propellant gauging accurately predicts the tank pressure flight data. This work has led to design changes in the Psyche spacecraft avionics that will further improve propellant gauging uncertainties, which is particularly important for later phases of the mission. Finally, we statistically combine the predicted propellant mass uncertainties from the two gauging methods and demonstrate that the system will meet the mission requirements for propellant uncertainty. Together, all of this work provides confidence that the Psyche mission can be successfully completed within the existing propellant budget and propellant tank capacity."
2184,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230006995,2023-08-03,Assessing Ceres’ Past and Current Habitability,"Dwarf planet Ceres is a compelling target as an evolved ocean world with, at least, regional brine reservoirs and potentially ongoing geological activity. Situated in the Main Belt of asteroids, Ceres is the most water-rich body in the inner solar system (in relative abundance) and is accessible enough for a sample return with the resources of a typical medium-class (New Frontiers) NASA mission. NASA’s Dawn mission at Ceres revealed the presence of liquid, brine-driven activity, organic matter, and a rich salt chemistry. With this evidence, the overarching goals of the mission concept presented herein are to quantify Ceres’ current habitability potential and origin. A sample return from young evaporite deposits in Occator crater offers greater science return than an in situ exploration mission by enabling high-resolution analysis of (1) organic matter expected from terrestrial and chondritic analogs that are trapped in salt minerals and (2) isotopes of refractory elements for a similar cost and less science risk. The sample return concept would be executed with a single flight system due to Ceres’ relative proximity to Earth and low gravity. Solar electric propulsion was identified as the most cost-effective approach for getting to Ceres and back. De-orbiting, landing, and takeoff are performed with a throttleable monopropellant hydrazine system. The solar arrays are stowed prior to landing and takeoff. Sample acquisition builds on the pneumatic system designed by Honeybee Robotics. The sample return mission concept relies on the availability of key technologies: an enhanced landing vision system leveraging investments from Mars 2020; retractable/redeployable solar arrays, which have been demonstrated on the International Space Station but not at Ceres’ gravity; and an emerging design from upcoming missions for sample transfer from the pneumatic sampling system to the sample return capsule. Return of a sample of mass ~100 g from Ceres, maintained at ≤ -20°C, is without precedent for any currently advocated Ocean World mission, enabling a vast range of experimental techniques back on Earth with sensitivities and accuracies far beyond those feasible with in situ instruments. A sample of this size also enables analyses to benefit from techniques that will become available in the future."

Spirit and Opportunity were built and operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which is managed by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) for NASA. Spirit landed at Gusev Crater, 14.8 degrees south of the equator, and operated continuously on the surface of Mars from January 4, 2004 until last contact from Spirit on March 22, 2010. Opportunity landed at Meridiani Planum, a location 2.5 degrees south of the Martian equator. Opportunity operated continuously on the Martian surface from January 25, 2004 until the last received transmission from Opportunity on June 10, 2018. The goal of the MER project was to determine if Mars ever had a habitable environment, in particular, if it ever had water. During their missions, both Spirit and Opportunity found evidence that liquid water once flowed on the surface of Mars. Both Spirit and Opportunity used a 1.33 m2 triple-junction solar array as their power sources. Based on observations of the original Mars rover, the Sojourner rover of the Mars Pathfinder mission that landed on Mars on July 4, 1997, the expectation was that the Martian dust would rapidly accumulate on the solar arrays of Spirit and Opportunity, and that the rovers would not have enough energy to continue operations after 90 Martian days (sols). Instead, due in part to lower dust accumulation rates than expected and numerous dust cleaning events, the Spirit and Opportunity rovers continued to operate on the Martian surface for over 2000 sols (MER-A) and 5000 sols (MER-B), respectively. During this time, the rovers experienced multiple Martian winters and several dust storms. Because the sources of solar array energy loss were known, the solar array energy output offered a method to scientifically estimate the loading and aeolian removal of dust from the solar arrays each sol. The MER Power operations team called this value that they calculated the solar array Dust Factor (DF). Dust Factor was defined as the fraction of sunlight that penetrates the accumulated dust on the surface of the solar array. A Dust Factor of 1.0 would indicate that the solar array was perfectly clean. A Dust Factor of 0.6 would indicate that only 60% of the available sunlight was able to penetrate the accumulated dust on the solar arrays. The MER Power subsystem operations team used the Multi-Mission Power Analysis Tool (MMPAT) to perform these Dust Factor calculations. The MMPAT software tool modeled the behavior of the solar arrays and the batteries as they interacted with the spacecraft power loads over the mission timeline. MMPAT also had knowledge (through telemetry and user inputs) of telemetered Power subsystem voltages and currents, atmospheric opacity (Tau), rover surface location, rover attitude, the planetary tilt and distance of Mars from the sun based on day of year, the instantaneous elevation of the sun based on time of day, temperatures (internal and external), terrain masking, and shadowing (due to the camera mast and antennas). Once all of the known sources of array energy loss are accounted, the remaining difference between the expected array energy and the actual array energy determines the solar array Dust Factor. The assumptions made while determining the Dust Factor are 1) that the single measured atmospheric opacity value (Tau) is constant over the course of the entire sol, 2) there is no measurable solar cell degradation, 3) there are no shorted strings and therefore, 4) all unexpected solar array energy losses are due to accumulated dust on the solar array. Although it cannot provide an absolute measure of dust loading, the determination of solar array Dust Factor provides a useful way of tracking dust accumulation and aeolian dust removal trends on Martian spacecraft. Any spacecraft on the Martian surface is vulnerable to dust, especially solar-powered spacecraft. The Spirit and Opportunity rovers were operational on the Martian surface for much longer than expected due in part to aeolian removal of dust from their solar arrays. The first few dust removal events were a pleasant surprise to the MER operations teams; however, over time a pattern began to arise. In over three Mars Years on the surface, the Power operations team tracked the solar array Dust Factor at Gusev Crater (location of MER-A) and observed that there were several significant dust removal and deposition events in Mars Year (MY) 27, even in the absence of a large dust storm. In MY 28 at Gusev Crater, the large atmospheric opacity (Tau) increase lagged significant dust removal events. Overall at Gusev Crater, there was a pattern of steady dust accumulation on the solar arrays, with a small number of significant dust cleaning events. At Meridiani Planum, where Opportunity rover operated for over seven Mars Years (late MY 26 to mid MY 34), a clear and consistent pattern of dust movement emerged. Meridiani Planum had a predictable, seasonally dependent pattern of gradual and continuous dust accumulation and removal. In summary, this paper explains the reasons for the development of the solar array Dust Factor and how it was used in mission operations. In particular, this paper describes the MMPAT software package, how it models array energy, including the important assumptions, model inputs and sources of error. And finally, this paper will show how the calculated solar array Dust Factor was used at Gusev Crater and Meridiani Planum to predict dust accumulation rates and weather patterns, and the importance of this generated data set for current and future solar- powered missions to Mars, such as the InSight lander and the planned Mars Sample Return rover."

They can access a diversity of oxidation states and can mediate electron transfer over an extended range of reduction potentials spanning more than 1 V. Depending on the protein micro-environment and geometry of ligand, co-ordination the iron-sulfur clusters can occur in different forms [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], HiPIP [4Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S]. There are several spectroscopic methods available to characterize the composition and electronic configuration of the iron-sulfur clusters, such as optical methods and electron paramagnetic resonance. This paper presents the protocols used to characterize the metal center of Coiled-Coil Iron-Sulfur (CCIS), an artificial metalloprotein containing one [4Fe-4S] cluster. It is expected that these protocols will be of general utility for other iron-sulfur proteins."

This requirement is verified either by test or analysis with engineers using different approaches to meet this requirement. A commonly used approach is to consider the rms acceleration Center of Gravity (CG) responses of test articles undergoing random vibration tests. The differences between structural engineers and/or test conductors within the space industry exist on how the data obtained from flight hardware random vibration tests are used to estimate QSLs. In this paper, a method to accurately estimate the CG grms from the acceleration power spectral densities with an appropriate sigma value to estimate peak CG accelerations is discussed. Recommendations are made to ensure that the community follows consistent QSL estimation from random vibration test data. The method of estimating the CG acceleration responses may also be used to response limit if the flight hardware responses exceed flight limit loads with margins."

2204,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230005716,2023-08-03,Design of Solar Sailing Trajectories Resilient to Safe Mode Events,"Solar sails are an enabling technology for stand-alone small-satellite deep-space exploration. However, their always-on nature, combined with the time of flight required for deep-space missions, makes them particularly susceptible to safe mode events. Unlike missions using electric propulsion, exclusively solar sail- ing missions cannot carry extra propellant to make up for a safe mode event, and more powerful methods like expected availability cannot be directly applied. This work extends the expected availability and duty cycle approaches to solar sailing. Through an application to NASA’s Solar Cruiser mission, a 46 % increase in tra- jectory resilience is obtained at negligible change in the mission’s time of flight. Additionally, it is shown that when a safe mode event stops the spacecraft from reaching its target orbit, the developed methods reduce the expected final error by approximately an order of magnitude."

Such microconical arrays were fabricated in photoresist by using a nanoscribe tool directly on top of the front-illuminated Ni/Si Schottky-barrier, and three-fold enhancement in the photocurrent response was observed.

As part of an investigation into improved efficiency and responsiveness, we have been exploring and prototyping the infusion of a ”demand access” model into the DSN scheduling process. Today, DSN is fully pre-scheduled in advance, and many users rely on a stable schedule to plan their own spacecraft activities, weeks in advance of execution. However, a new class of missions is emerging that may not be scheduled as far in advance, and may be event-driven in coming across science targets at unpredictable times. These users could take advantage of an on-demand mechanism to download data. Simulations have shown that such a mechanism could improve latency (time from data collection to download) by 2x, as well as more efficiently utilize the available DSN antennas. In this paper, we describe a prototype of a demand access process and how it addresses the challenges of co-existing with a staticallyscheduled body of missions, while providing the benefits of lower latency science data return."

This paper presents new algorithms for global shape reconstructions from sparse tracked surface points. These methods leverage estimates from earlier phases, such as rotation pole, as well as a priori knowledge, such as a genus-0 body (i.e. without boundaries or topological holes). A mapping algorithm is proposed, which performs faithful reconstructions while enforcing genus-0 output through spherical parameterization. To estimate the shape of permanently shadowed regions of the body, a symmetry reconstruction method is added to the reconstruction algorithms. This method is shown to substantially increase the reconstruction accuracy but is subject to the symmetry of the body perpendicular to the rotation pole. The proposed mapping algorithm is compared to stateof- the-practice surface reconstruction algorithms, assessing their accuracy and ability to correctly generate genus-0 shape models for 2400 datasets and three small bodies. The proposed spherical parameterization algorithm performed consistently with the state-of-the-practice while being the only algorithm to always produce genus-0 shape models."

Coronagraph compatibility with segmented apertures is essential for the success of habitable planet characterization with future large aperture space telescopes, such as the Large UV/Optical/Infrared (LUVOIR) and HabEx telescope mission concepts. The PIAACMC is compatible with such segmented telescope apertures with little loss of performance. We report the contrast and other performance results of a PIAACMC coronagraph with a LUVOIR-like pupil mask assembled and tested in a vacuum chamber at the JPL high contrast imaging testbed (HCIT). The goals of the demonstration were to achieve 1e-9 mean contrast over a semi-annular field of view from 2 λ/D to 8 λ/D, first with monochromatic light at 650nm, and then over a 10% spectral bandwidth. In addition, the measurement of jitter and its effect on PIAACMC performance will be discussed. As the success of electric field conjugation (EFC) to achieve best contrast on the testbed is dependent upon a diffraction model of the coronagraph, we will also discuss variations of the testbed and its diffraction model with the PIAACMC design, including suspected sources of knowledge error in the EFC diffraction model."

Five different operating conditions of the H9 magnetically shielded Hall thruster are simulated with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Hall2De. In order to capture the inherent uncertainty associated with the closure model, O(100) simulations are run for each condition, each of using a coefficient set sampled randomly from a probability distribution. The results of these simulations provide probabilistic predictions of thruster performance quantities including thrust, and discharge current, as well as several component efficiencies and centerline plasma properties. The model is found to yield converged solutions at all conditions, with large 10 kHzrange oscillations and performance trends with voltage and flow rate similar to experiment. The model under-predicts the thrust by 15-25% and over-predicts the discharge current by 20% on average compared to experiments at the same discharge voltage and mass flow rate. This performance discrepancy is due to lower beam utilization, mass utilization, and divergence efficiency than experiment, resulting from high Hall parameters in the acceleration region, which lead to a protracted ion acceleration region. The physical processes underlying this result are discussed in the context of future data-driven modeling efforts."
2212,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220004109,2023-08-03,Improved Constraints for the XUV Luminosity Evolution of Trappist-1,"We re-examine the XUV luminosity evolution of TRAPPIST-1 utilizing new observational constraints of the current stellar parameters (XUV and bolometric luminosity) from multi-epoch X-ray/UV photometry.   Following  the  formalism  presented  on  Fleming  et  al.  (2020),  we  infer  that  TRAPPIST-1maintained a saturated XUV luminosity,  relative to the bolometric luminosity,  of log10(LXUV/Lbol)=−3.03+0.25−0.23at early times for a period of tsat= 3.14+2.22−1.46Gyr.  After the saturation phase, we find LXUV decayed over time by an exponential rate ofβXUV=−1.17+0.27−0.28.  Compared to our inferred age of the system, age = 7.96+1.78−1.87Gyr, our result for tsat suggests that there is only a∼4% chance thatTRAPPIST-1 still remains in the saturated phase today, which is significantly lower than the previous estimate of 40%.  Despite this reduction in tsat, our results remain consistent in the conclusion that the TRAPPIST-1 planets likely received an extreme amount XUV energy—an estimated integrated XUV energy of∼1030−1032erg over the star’s lifetime—that is∼15% lower than the original result."

This screening study identifies VOCs emitted  from  two  types  of  air  fresheners.  Plug-in  air  fresheners  are  household  products  that  release  scents  from  a  heated liquid. Little Tree air fresheners are commonly used solid devices designed to hang in from the rear view mirror in cars. VOCs that were released from heated samples of air fresheners were identified by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (GCMS). Amongst VOCs commonly known to have scent properties, this screening also revealed the presence of compounds that are not associated with fragrances and that may have adverse health effects. In a pilot study to characterize how air fresheners affect air quality in real settings, air samples were collected on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) field samplers in a home setting and inside a vehicle, before and during air-freshener use. This pilot demonstrated some limited potential for SPME field samplers to track changes in VOC levels in real-life settings."

2221,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220004503,2023-08-03,Monitoring Eco-Hydrological Spring Onset Over Alaska and Northern Canada With Complementary Satellite Remote Sensing Data,"More than half of the global land area undergoes seasonal freeze/thaw (FT) transitions in spring. Spatial patterns and timing of spring thawing influence eco-hydrological processes and landscape moisture availability over arctic and boreal ecosystems. The seasonal progression of spring thawing coincides with warmer temperatures, snowmelt, and a rapid increase in soil moisture, which initiates the growing season for ecosystem productivity. In this study, we utilize complementary satellite observations to determine the pattern and order of occurrence in landscape thawing, soil moisture increase, and ecosystem productivity that collectively define the eco-hydrological spring onset across Alaska and Northern Canada. Satellite data utilized include landscape FT status from SMAP and AMSR-2, OCO-2 derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (GOSIF), and gross primary production (GPP) and soil moisture from SMAP.  The resulting spring onset maps showed spring thawing as the precursor to growing season onset, indicated by a rapid rise in available soil moisture and GPP. Our results indicated an average spring transition period of 3±2 (SD) weeks between initial landscape thawing and growing season onset. A rapid increase in soil moisture generally followed landscape thawing but occurred before the subsequent seasonal rise in GPP. Spring onset generally occurred earlier in boreal forest (DOY 102±14) than arctic tundra (DOY 124±22)."
2222,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220004511,2023-08-03,"Designing a Decontamination Solution for the Low-Earth-Orbit, Cryogenic SPHEREx Mission","To address the scientific goals of NASA’s astrophysics division, the JPL and Caltech’s SPHEREx mission conducts the first near-infrared all-sky spectral survey in low-earth-orbit using a passively-cooled, cryogenic telescope. Several unique water contamination issues arise due to the combination of cryogenic operation temperatures and the limited temperature control authority of passive cooling. Because water molecules have adsorption bands within the wavelengths of interest for SPHEREx’s survey, it is imperative that water contamination be controlled and minimized. In this work, a model is developed for the SPHEREx mission to predict the transport and accumulation of outgassed water onto sensitive payload components. The model utilizes the time dependent thermal profiles of the individual payload components, initial water content, and spacecraft geometry to calculate the time dependent water diffusion, transport, and adsorption. This model is subsequently used to predict water contamination risks and design decontamination solutions for each risk. Two major water contamination risks were predicted, water accumulation during cooldown and on cryogenic surfaces during the mission. The first risk occurs during the cooldown of the payload to cryogenic temperatures, predicting water accumulation on optical surfaces in excess of the allowable levels. To mitigate this accumulation, the temperature of the optical surfaces is controlled during cooldown through a combination of heaters and spacecraft pointing. The second risk is that over the course of the mission, is unavoidable water accumulation onto the payload thermal system’s cryogenic surfaces, possibly jeopardizing thermal performance and temperature stability, both of which are required for science success. To decontaminate any water that had collected onto cryogenic thermal system surfaces, a decontamination maneuver was designed. In this decontamination maneuver, cryogenic surfaces of the thermal system are warmed to a temperature where water will desorb by spacecraft pointing while still meeting all avoidance constraints, and thereby avoiding undue risk to the observatory hardware. Through application of the developed analytical model and inclusion of the decontamination maneuver in the mission design, SPHEREx can confidently demonstrate that it is able to decontaminate, at the start of and during the mission as needed to meet its end of life science performance requirements."

While much of the historical emphasis has been on maximizing the output power and/or spectral purity, a recent new focus has been on engineering these lasers to operate as optical frequency combs (OFCs) for broadband real-time spectroscopy. In particular, the combination of low-drive-power and broad gain bandwidth has made interband cascade laser (ICL) OFCs an attractive complement to quantum cascade laser OFCs operating at longer wavelengths. Moreover, ICL combs can potentially be incorporated into fully-integrated dual-comb spectrometers that employ fast, room-temperature IC photodetectors processed on the same chip.However, the high refractive index of the ICL’s GaSb substrate poses some challenges to the optical waveguiding. Because the modal index is considerably lower than that of the substrate, the optical field can penetrate the bottom cladding layer and leak into the GaSb, inducing wavelength-dependent interference that modifies the gain and group velocity dispersion (GVD) profiles. Even when the effect on lasing threshold is small, the comb properties can be adversely affected. Using the sub-threshold Fourier transform technique, we studied ICL combs with various ridge widths, substrate thicknesses, and center wavelengths. This allowed us to evaluate the effects of modal leakage on the GVD. We find that the resonant nature of the substrate modes induces oscillations, which affect both the spectral bandwidth and the phase-locking properties above threshold. Strategies to mitigate the GVD’s undesired and unpredictable spectral variation will be presented."

The RO technique measures the Doppler shift of radio signals of a spacecraft occulting behind a planet’s limb that contains information about the planet’s atmospheric density, temperature, and pressure. We design a smallsat constellation and simulate “crosslink” RO observations between the smallsats to determine the expected accuracy and spatiotemporal coverage of Mars RO atmospheric profiles. Such measurements are key to spacecraft Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) and Ascent from the Surface (AST) of Mars. Today, there are limited number of Mars atmospheric profiles with high vertical resolution, especially measurements near the surface that are difficult to obtain from satellite-based passive instruments due to atmospheric absorption. We find that crosslink ROs between a constellation of six smallsats provide global and diurnal cycle coverage with dozens of occultations per day, providing temperature information from near-surface up to ~45 km with altitude-dependent accuracy that ranges between <0.5 K at lower altitude to <5 K in the middle-to-upper atmosphere. Ionospheric ROs reveal an expected electron density of ~5 – 10% at the peak ionospheric height between 100 and 140 km. We conclude that observations obtained from a smallsat constellation can augment existing observing platforms by reducing observational gaps and yield high resolution measurements required for safe spacecraft operations during EDL and AST."
2225,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220004634,2023-08-03,What it Takes to Compute Highly Accurate Rovibrational Line Lists for Use in Astrochemistry,"We review the Best Theory + Reliable High-resolution Experiment (BTRHE) strategy for
obtaining highly accurate molecular rovibrational line lists with InfraRed (IR) intensities. The
need for highly accurate molecular rovibrational line lists is two-fold: a) assignment of the many rovibrational lines for common stable molecules especially those that exhibit a large amplitude motion, such as NH3, or have a high density of states such as SO2; and b) characterization of the atmospheres of exoplanets which will be one of the main areas of research in astronomy in the coming decades. The first motivation arises due to the need to eliminate lines due to common molecules in an astronomical observation in order to identify lines from new molecules, while the second motivation arises due to the need to obtain accurate molecular opacities in order to characterize the atmosphere of an exoplanet. The BTRHE strategy first consists of using high quality ab initio quantum chemical methods to obtain a global potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment surface (DMS) that contains the proper physics. The global PES is then refined using a subset of the reliable high-resolution experimental data. The refined PES then gives energy level predictions to an accuracy similar to the reproduction accuracy of the experimental data used in the refinement step in the interpolation region (i.e., within the range of the experimental data used in the refinement step). The accuracy of the energy levels will slowly degrade as they are extrapolated to spectral regions beyond the high-resolution experimental data used in the refinement step. However, because the degradation is slow, the predicted energy levels can be used to assign new high-resolution experiments, and the data from these can then be used in a subsequent refinement step. In this way, the global PES eventually can yield highly accurate energy levels for all desired spectral regions including to very high energies and high J values. We show that IR intensities computed with the BTRHE rovibrational wavefunctions and the DMS can be very accurate provided one has minimized the fitting error of the DMS and tested the completeness of the DMS. Some examples of our work on NH3, CO2, and SO2 are given to highlight the usefulness of the BTRHE strategy and to provide ideas on how to further improve its predictive power in the future. In particular, it is shown how successive refinement steps, once new high-resolution data is available, can lead to PESs that yield highly accurate transition energies to larger spectral regions. The importance of including non-adiabatic corrections to reduce the J-dependence of errors for H-containing molecules is shown with work on NH3. Another very important aspect of the BTRHE approach is the consistency across isotopologues, which allows for highly accurate line lists for any isotopologue once one is obtained for the main isotopologue (which has more high-resolution data available for refinement)."

Here, we utilize observed and reanalyzed radiative fluxes and atmospheric profiles from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program and ERA5 reanalysis to assess a set of observation-based radiative kernels from CloudSat for six ARM sites. The CloudSat radiative kernels, convoluted with the ERA5 state variables, can almost perfectly reconstruct the monthly anomalies of shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative fluxes in ERA5 at the surface (SFC) and top-of atmosphere (TOA) with correlations significantly being greater than 0.95. The biases of kernel-estimated flux anomalies calculated using the ARM-observed state variables can be more than twice as large when compared with the ARM-observed surface flux anomalies and Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) observed anomalies at the TOA.  Generally, clouds contribute to most (>60%) of the variance of flux anomalies at Southern Great Plain (SGP), Tropical Western Pacific (TWP), and Eastern North Atlantic (ENA), and surface albedo dominates (>69%) the variance of SW flux anomalies at North Slope of Alaska (NSA). The radiative kernels exhibit the lowest correlation (r~[0.55,0.85]) when reconstructing SFC LW flux anomalies at SGP, TWP, and ENA, whose biases are related to the possibility that the kernels may not fully capture the characteristics 47 associated with MJO and ENSO at TWP and the presence of clouds at SGP and ENA."

Candidate emission and sink scenarios are constructed based on proposed hypotheses in the literature. These scenarios are simulated in the TM5 tracer transport model for 1984–2016 to produce three-dimensional fields of CH4 and δ13C-CH4, which are compared with observations to test the competing hypotheses in the literature in one common model framework. We find that the fossil fuel (FF) CH4 emission trend from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research 4.3.2 inventory does not agree with observed δ13C-CH4. Increased FF CH4 emissions are unlikely to be the dominant driver for the post-2006 global CH4 increase despite the possibility for a small FF emission increase. We also find that a significant decrease in the abundance of hydroxyl radicals (OH) cannot explain the post-2006 global CH4 increase since it does not track the observed decrease in global mean δ13C-CH4. Different CH4 sinks have different fractionation factors for δ13C-CH4, thus we can investigate the uncertainty introduced by the reaction of CH4 with tropospheric chlorine (Cl), a CH4 sink whose abundance, spatial distribution, and temporal changes remain uncertain. Our results show that including or excluding tropospheric Cl as a 13 Tg/year CH4 sink in our model changes the magnitude of estimated fossil emissions by ∼20%. We also found that by using different wetland emissions based on a static versus a dynamic wetland area map, the partitioning between FF and microbial sources differs by 20 Tg/year, ∼12% of estimated fossil emissions."

For this reason, current land surface models include phenology parameterizations and related biophysical and biogeochemical processes. In this work, the climatology of the beginning and end of the growing season, simulated by the land component of seven state-of-the-art European Earth system models participating in the CMIP6, is evaluated globally against satellite observations. The assessment is performed using the vegetation metric leaf area index and a recently developed approach, named four growing season types. On average, the land surface models show a 0.6-month delay in the growing season start, while they are about 0.5 months earlier in the growing season end. The difference with observation tends to be higher in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere. High agreement between land surface models and observations is exhibited in areas dominated by broadleaf deciduous trees, while high variability is noted in regions dominated by broadleaf deciduous shrubs. Generally, the timing of the growing season end is accurately simulated in about 25 % of global land grid points versus 16 % in the timing of growing season start. The refinement of phenology parameterization can lead to better representation of vegetation-related energy, water, and carbon cycles in land surface models, but plant phenology is also affected by plant physiology and soil hydrology processes. Consequently, phenology representation and, in general, vegetation modelling is a complex task, which still needs further improvement, evaluation, and multi-model comparison."

Field monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms can be costly, but satellite remote sensing has shown utility for more efficient spatial and temporal monitoring across the United States. Here, satellite imagery was used to assess the annual frequency of surface cyanobacterial blooms, defined for each satellite pixel as the percentage of images for that pixel throughout the year exhibiting detectable cyanobacteria. Cyanobacterial frequency was assessed across 2,196 large lakes in 46 states across the continental United States (CONUS) using imagery from the European Space Agency’s Ocean and Land Colour Imager for the years 2017 through 2019. In 2019, across all satellite pixels considered, annual bloom frequency had a median value of 4% and a maximum value of 100%, the latter indicating that for those satellite pixels, a cyanobacterial bloom was detected by the satellite sensor for every satellite image considered. In addition to annual pixel-scale cyanobacterial frequency, results were summarized at the lake- and state-scales by averaging annual pixel-scale results across each lake and state. For 2019, average annual lake-scale frequencies also had a maximum value of 100%, and Oregon and Ohio had the highest average annual state-scale frequencies at 65% and 52%. Pixel-scale frequency results can assist in identifying portions of a lake that are more prone to cyanobacterial blooms, while lake- and state-scale frequency results can assist in the prioritization of sampling resources and mitigation efforts. Satellite imagery is limited by the presence of snow and ice, as imagery collected in these conditions are quality flagged and discarded. Thus, annual bloom frequencies within nine climate regions were investigated to determine whether missing data biased results in climate regions more prone to snow and ice, given that their annual summaries would be weighted toward the summer months when cyanobacterial blooms tend to occur. Results were unbiased by the time period selected in most climate regions, but a large bias was observed for the Northwest Rockies and Plains climate region. Moderate biases were observed for the Ohio Valley and the Southeast climate regions. Finally, a clustering analysis was used to identify areas of high and low cyanobacterial frequency across CONUS based on average annual lake-scale cyanobacterial frequencies for 2019. Several clusters were identified that transcended state, watershed, and eco-regional boundaries. Combined with additional data, results from the clustering analysis may offer insight regarding large-scale drivers of cyanobacterial blooms."

Here we use Moon Mineralogy Mapper surficial water ice detections to investigate the location of water ice-bearing permanently shaded regions near the south pole. We extract a variety of parameters such as their temperature regime, slope, hydrogen content, number of ice detections, depth stability for water ice and dry ice, and mobility aspects. We identify 169 water ice-bearing PSRs and use their characteristics to identify sites that allow to access the highest abundances of volatiles, sites that can be visited to characterize the lateral or vertical distribution of volatiles (water ice and dry ice), and sites that allow for the fastest recovery of a scientifically interesting sample. Collectively, 37 PSRs are identified as sites of interest, including 11 that would address more than one mission objective and may be, for that reason, higher priority targets of exploration. These PSRs are found in Shoemaker, Faustini, Cabeus, Malapert, Nobile, Sverdrup, Wiechert J and Haworth craters, as well as 3 unnamed craters (PSRs 57, 120, 89). These sites are all located within 6 degrees of the south pole. We present case studies for a relatively short traverse mission (20 to 50 km) to PSR 89, a medium length traverse (~100 km) to Sverdrup 1, and a longer traverse (~300 km) to Cabeus that can serve as a guide in planning upcoming exploration missions."

Such inter-seasonal autocorrelation can have modest skill in forecasting future conditions several months in advance. Because robust instrumental observations of precipitation span less than 100 years, the temporal stability of the relationship between seasonal moisture anomalies is uncertain. The North American Seasonal Precipitation Atlas (NASPA) is a gridded network of separately reconstructed cool (December-April) and warm (May-July) season precipitation series and offers new insights on the intra-annual changes in drought for up to 2,000 years. Here, the NASPA precipitation reconstructions are rescaled to represent the long-term soil moisture balance during the cool season and three-month long atmospheric moisture during the warm season. These rescaled seasonal reconstructions are then used to quantify the frequency, magnitude, and spatial extent of cool season drought that was relieved or reversed during the following summer months. The adjusted seasonal reconstructions reproduce the general patterns of large-scale drought amelioration and termination in the instrumental record during the 20th century and are used to estimate relief and reversals for the most skillfully reconstructed past 500-years. Sub-continental to continental scale reversals of cool season drought in the following warm season have been rare, but the reconstructions display periods prior to the instrumental data of increased reversal probabilities for the Mid-Atlantic region and the US Southwest. Drought relief at the continental scale may arise in part from macroscale ocean-atmosphere processes, while the smaller scale regional reversals may reflect land-surface feedbacks and stochastic variability."

The GA-ASI team consisted of technical experts, program managers, engineers, mechanics, flight technicians, flight crews, and numerous other subject matter experts.  This final report describes the most significant and potentially impactful aspects of the planning, integration, test, and flight aspects of this effort.  GA-ASI successfully integrated the key technologies needed for UAS to fly in the NAS onto our prototype SkyGuardian UAS, which was designed to meet the most stringent airworthiness standards applicable to an aircraft of its size category. A proven Detect and Avoid (DAA) system, developed by GA-ASI and utilizing Honeywell Aerospace technology was integrated onto
SkyGuardian for the first time, along with datalink radios from Collins Aerospace that meet the new civil standard for Control and Non-Payload Communication (CNPC) links. GA-ASI also obtained approvals from the FAA and FCC to operate the reconfigured UAS.  The SIO demonstration flight represented a commercial aerial surveying operation conducted at medium altitude (>10,000ft above mean sea level). The aircraft’s onboard sensors were used to capture photographic, infrared and radar imagery of public and commercial infrastructure and land, and to subsequently produce the types of data products that would provide business value to potential customers. These survey services would supplement or replace services currently provided by manned airplanes and helicopters, small drones or satellites. A “virtual” mission was also planned, to show what additional survey data could have been captured during the flight if additional sensors had been installed on the aircraft’s external hardpoints.  This revision of the final report focuses on information of value to the wider UAS community, and avoids propriety data to facilitate broad dissemination. It also includes a description of GA-ASI’s engagement with the FAA following the SIO flight, which led to the award of an updated Special Airworthiness Certificate in the Experimental Category (SAC-EC) and a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) allowing operation of the SkyGuardian UAS using its DAA system to satisfy right-of-way rules, instead of a chase plane. The associated operational limitations are described to illustrate the further steps that would be needed to remove those limitations for unhindered commercial operations."

Oculus has a dual-wavelength configuration (473 and 532 nm) and two detection geometries (off- and on-axis). Characteristics of scatterers were investigated based on two complementary LiDAR-derived proxies (the Structural Dissimilarity Index and the spectral slope of LiDAR backscattering). In March 2017, field measurements showed a covariation between direct and diffuse backscattering contributions during morning hours and away from shore. LiDAR attenuation coefficients explained up to 57% of IOPs variability. The analysis of LiDAR-derived proxies suggested higher turbidity and larger particulates near the coast."

The signal was accompanied by an electromagnetic counterpart including a kilonova component powered by the decay of radioactive nuclei, as well as a short γ-ray burst. In order to understand the radioactively powered signal, it is necessary to simulate the outflows and their nucleosynthesis from the post-merger disk. Simulating the disk and predicting the composition of the outflows requires general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations that include a realistic, finite-temperature equation of state (EOS) and self-consistently calculating the impact of neutrinos. In this work, we detail the implementation of a finite-temperature EOS and the treatment of neutrinos in the GRMHD code HARM3D+NUC, based on HARM3D. We include formal tests of both the finite-temperature EOS and the neutrino-leakage scheme. We further test the code by showing that, given conditions similar to those of published remnant disks following neutron star mergers, it reproduces both recombination of free nucleons to a neutron-rich composition and excitation of a thermal wind."

With the unique reverse flow hydrology of the Tonlé Sap River, this freshwater system contains rich biodiversity and provides critical freshwater resources for the local community. Overfishing, stronger seasonality, drought, dam construction, forest fires, and untreated industrial domestic sewage threaten the ecosystem vitality and economic success of Tonlé Sap. In collaboration with Conservation International and the Cambodian Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology’s Tonlé Sap Authority, we calibrated and finalized remotely-sensed proxies for sub-indicators of the Freshwater Health Index (FHI). We used NASA Earth observation data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). These datasets were used in RS proxies and a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model that previous teams developed for sub-indicators of FHI. They included landcover, bank modification, and water quality metrics. It was determined that the ground water storage in Tonlé Sap Lake exhibited a slight declining trend over from April 1st, 2002 to February 3rd, 2017. To calculate chlorophyll-a concentration in the Tonlé Sap Lake, we used Copernicus Global Land Service mission data which provided a Trophic State Index of the lake. Between January 1st, 2000 and December 31st, 2020, the lake and surrounding region within the study area boundary displayed a slight decrease in vegetation density and consistently high chlorophyll-a concentrations. The SWAT model calculated nitrogen and phosphorus content measured in outlet points of the lake. We demonstrated that remotely sensed data is valuable for providing additional information for the FHI, but is not fully capable of replacing its in situ counterpart. We also concluded the water quantity is on a slowly declining trend within the basin."

Here, we present novel satellite-derived indices of chlorophyll-based production based on the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), whose hourly imaging capability offer the potential for direct estimates of net phytoplankton growth over hourly to seasonal time scales. Our results reveal large variations in net chlorophyll growth in the GOCI study region, both over the day and between seasons. Hourly changes in chlorophyll concentration are highest during spring while growth rates show maxima during the winter. We show seasonal relationships between growth and photon flux. Our study suggests that Geostationary Ocean Color data can be used to constrain phytoplankton productivity on diurnal time scales and be an essential tool to better understand diurnal growth patterns over large spatial regions."

Specifically, we highlight advances in broadband radiative transfer modeling, and the optical and physical parameterizations necessary to run them.  We present two years of results, across two decades (2008 vs. 2018), highlighting seasonal and annual differences.  The goal of this endeavor is to standardize mechanics for transitioning this work to operational Level 2 ground and satellite lidar products moving forward.  However, the unique TOA forcing characteristics of cirrus clouds are also discussed, including specifically daytime characteristics than can oscillate between warming and cooling regionally."

Overfishing and habitat loss caused a severe decline in the salmon population, restricting North America’s remaining wild Atlantic salmon to rivers in Maine. Land use and land cover (LULC) change and factors associated with temperature and precipitation are important for understanding the suitability of freshwater habitat for juvenile salmon. In collaboration with the Maine Department of Marine Resources and the Downeast Salmon Federation, the team utilized NASA Earth observations to aid partners in understanding how these factors change in relation to critical salmon habitat. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery was analyzed to assess changes in LULC between 1985 and 2021. Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM IMERG) data were used to determine land surface temperature and precipitation, respectively; between 2000 and 2020. Lastly, temperature and precipitation anomaly maps visualized deviation from the 20-year climatic average for each pixel. LULC analysis for 1985 to 2020 showed a loss of forest cover throughout critical salmon habitat although gains in forested area were also observed. Assessment of mean summer land surface temperature revealed an increase in temperature from 2000 to 2020 and anomaly maps highlighted areas experiencing abnormally high or low summer precipitation and temperature. These results and the underlying data were packaged for the partner organizations to inform future conservation efforts."

However, the prevalence of young and compact jets – and their impact on the interstellar medium – remains an open question. Multi-epoch radio surveys with cadences of years to decades offer a promising means of identifying even faint (mJy-level) jets that are compact and potentially young on the basis of variability. Recently, a comparison of images from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS)
and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) survey has revealed a population of distant (0.2 < z < 3.2) quasars that have brightened dramatically in the past 1–2 decades. These quasars appear to have transitioned from “radio-quiet” nondetections in FIRST to “radio-loud” detections in VLASS. Extensive multiband follow-up observations with the VLA from 1 to 18GHz have revealed compact (sub-kpc) radio sources that are consistent with young
jets that were recently triggered. Here, we summarize the status of our on-going study of quasars with newborn jets identified in the radio time domain."

Frequently, dynamically downscaled climate inputs are used in conjunction with land-surface models (LSMs) to provide hydrologic streamflow projections, which serve as critical inputs for WMMs. Here, we show how even modest projection errors can strongly affect assessments of water availability and financial stability for irrigation districts in California. Specifically, our results highlight that LSM errors in projections of flood and drought extremes are highly interactive across timescales, path-dependent, and can be amplified when modeling infrastructure systems (e.g., misrepresenting banked groundwater). Common strategies for reducing errors in deterministic LSM hydrologic projections (e.g., bias correction) can themselves strongly distort projected climate vulnerabilities and misrepresent their inferred financial consequences. Overall, our results indicate a need to move beyond standard deterministic climate projection and error management frameworks that are dependent on single simulated climate change scenario outcomes."

In this study, we used the long-term measurements from AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) to better understand the aerosol types and composition with respect to their seasonal and spatial variabilities in peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA, here defined as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar). Two methods (i.e., aerosol type cluster and aerosol component retrieval) were applied to determine the aerosol type and chemical composition during the biomass-burning (BB) season. AERONET sites in northern PSEA showed a higher AOD (aerosol optical depth) compared to that of southern PSEA. Differences in land use pattern, geographic location, and weather regime caused much of the aerosol variability over PSEA. Lower single-scattering albedo (SSA) and higher fine-mode fraction (FMF) values were observed in February and March, suggesting the predominance of BB type aerosols with finer and stronger absorbing particles during the dry season. However, we also found that the peak BB month (i.e., March) in northern PSEA may not coincide with the lowest SSA once dust particles have mixed with the other aerosols. Furthermore, we investigated two severe BB events in March of 2014 and 2015, revealing a significant BrC fraction during BB event days. On high AOD days, although the BC fraction was high, the BrC fraction remained low due to lack of aerosol aging. This study highlights the dominance of carbonaceous aerosols in the PSEA atmosphere during the BB season, while also revealing that transported dust particles and BrC aerosol aging may introduce uncertainties into the aerosol radiative forcing calculation."

We present abundance ratios relative to both C2H6(a nonpolar molecule)and H2O(a polar molecule), thereby providing a more complete picture of the parent volatile composition of C/2018 Y1 and potential associations of ices in its nucleus. Overall, the measured spatial distributions for polar molecules(in particular, H2O and CH3OH)were broader, exhibiting more complex structure compared with nonpolar or weakly polar species(CH4,C2H6, andCO). Our January 13 results permitted quantitatively assessing the significant improvement in sensitivity delivered by iSHELL compared with previous capabilities at the IRTF. The efficient spectral coverage of iSHELL plus the favorable geocentric Doppler shift of C/2018 Y1 allowed for measuring>50% of CH4ν3-band emission intensity on both January 13 and February 5. Compositionally, compared to their respective mean abundances among comets from the Oort cloud, C2H6and CH3OH were enriched, CH4and HCN were near normal, and all other species were depleted. The abundance ratio CH3OH/C2H6was higher by 45%±8% on January 13 versusFebruary 5, whereas CH4/C2H6was unchanged within the uncertainty, suggesting nonhomogeneous composition among regions of the nucleus dominating activity on these dates"

The duration and hardness distribution of GRBs has two clusters, now understood to reflect (at least) two different progenitors. Short-hard GRBs (SGRBs; T(sub 90) < 2 s) arise from compact binary mergers, and long-soft GRBs (LGRBs; T(sub 90) > 2 s) have been attributed to the collapse of peculiar massive stars (collapsars). The discovery of SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 marked the first association of an LGRB with a collapsar, and AT 2017gfo/GRB 170817A/GW170817 marked the first association of an SGRB with a binary neutron star merger, which also produced a gravitational wave. Here, we present the discovery of ZTF20abwysqy (AT2020scz), a fast-fading optical transient in the Fermi satellite and the Interplanetary Network localization regions of GRB 200826A; X-ray and radio emission further confirm that this is the afterglow. Follow-up imaging (at rest-frame 16.5 days) reveals excess emission above the afterglow that cannot be explained as an underlying kilonova, but which is consistent with being the supernova. Although the GRB duration is short (rest-frame T90 of 0.65 s), our panchromatic follow-up data confirm a collapsar origin. GRB 200826A is the shortest LGRB found with an associated collapsar; it appears to sit on the brink between a successful and a failed collapsar. Our discovery is consistent with the hypothesis that most collapsars fail to produce ultra-relativistic jets."

Jansky Very Large Array for the radio counterpart of the gravitational wave candidate S191216ap, which is classified as a binary black hole merger and suggested to be a possible multimessenger event, based on the detection of a high-energy neutrino and a TeV photon. We carried out a blind search at C band (4–8 GHz) over 0.3 deg2 of the gamma-ray counterpart of S191216ap reported by the High-Altitude Water Cerenkov Observatory (HAWC). Our search, spanning three epochs over 130 days of postmerger and having a mean source-detection threshold of 75 μJy beam−1 (4σ), yielded five variable sources associated with active galactic nucleus activity and no definitive counterpart of S191216ap. We find <2% (3.0% ± 1.3%) of the persistent radio sources at 6 GHz to be variable on a timescale of <1 week (week–months), consistent with previous radio variability studies. Our 4σ radio luminosity upper limit of ∼1.2 × 1028 erg s−1 Hz−1 on the afterglow of S191216ap, within the HAWC error region, is 5–10 times deeper than previous binary black hole (BBH) radio afterglow searches. Comparing this upper limit with theoretical expectations given by Perna et al. for putative jets launched by BBH mergers, for on-axis jets with energy ≃1049 erg, we can rule out jet opening angles ≲ 20° (assuming that the counterpart lies within the 1σ HAWC region that we observed)."

Through a textile hierarchy spanning active material composition, yarn construction, textile geometry, and system architecture, these active textiles accomplish kinetic tunability, variable recruitment behaviors, and auxetic effects without mechanical contact, called active auxetic effects. New modes of pre-programmed multi-axial performance are enabled by geometrically manipulating—specifically pre-stressing and constraining—active filaments in torsion and leveraging their structural elastic instability within a textile geometry. The new kinematic motion afforded by torque-unbalanced active yarns enhances the performance of active textiles, which accomplish tensile strokes over 40%, generated blocked forces up to 308 N m−1, and specific work over 0.4. kJ kg−1. Advances in active textiles are demonstrated through multifunctional 3D applications, including a variable constriction pump that exhibits sequential actuation, a wearable that conforms multi-axially around the body, and a soft exoskeleton that performs assistive motions and on-body anchoring simultaneously. By harnessing the capabilities of active materials within a textile hierarchy, advances in the potentiality of multifunctional textiles are presented."

Growth in mission demand, both in number of spacecraft and in data return, has led to increased loading levels on the network, and actual demand frequently exceeds network capacity. The DSN scheduling process involves peer-to-peer collaborative negotiation, which consumes significant time and resources in order to reach a baseline version of the schedule, and then to manage and agree to changes. Process delays are exacerbated by the high level of oversubscription experienced by the DSN: it is not unusual for the scheduling process to start with 20-40% more requested time can be accommodated on the available antennas. The other NASA networks make use of a static mission priority list to address a similar problem: missions are ranked in priority order, then the schedule is populated by priority from highest to lowest. Such a mechanism would not work for DSN due to the heterogeneity of the mission set, and to the time-varying mission requirements with mission phase. This paper describes an alternative approach for the DSN that addresses key problems inherent in the current process — oversubsubscription and how to “fairly” reduce it to a manageable level. The main characteristics of the new approach are the use of loading-based limits based on balancing requested time, along with priorities and user preferences as the basis for optimization criteria that can be used by new algorithms."

We develop methodology, by deriving mathematical optimization formulation based on variational principles and Sobolev gradient descent, for reconstruction of AIRS spatial response functions.

We examine the repeatability of our reconstructions by computing PSFs based on data collected during two consecutive days, and also investigating the change in the reconstructions by comparing the reconstructed PSF based on data collected in the beginning and the middle of the mission. We also quantify uncertainties in our reconstruction results."

Consequently, much research has explored CS participants’ motivations and their relationship to participant recruitment and retention. However, much of this research has focused on actively participating citizen scientists. If researchers want to elucidate the relationship between participant factors (such as demographics and motivations) and participant retention, it is necessary to develop a more comprehensive picture of the different degrees of participation in CS. This paper presents a framework for classifying participation throughout the participant’s engagement in a CS project/program. We suggest a CS participation model that captures the dynamic nature of participation across an arc of volunteering. Called the Nibble-and-Drop Framework, the model describes multiple exit points and stages of contribution typical of participation in a CS program. Applying the framework to the NASA GLOBE Observer (GO) CS program, we found that it captured the dynamics of participation in a global-scale, mobile, app-based, contributory style CS project. The framework guided our analysis of how different participant factors correlate with degrees of participation. We found that participants were motivated to initially participate because they wanted to contribute to NASA research and science. Participants who dropped out of the program at various points often initially engaged through specific collection events and did not feel the need to continue contributing beyond the event; other drop-outs doubted whether their contributions were meaningful, showing again the need to ensure that participants understand the value of their engagement in a CS project."

The flow conditions match selected test conditions from a recent wind tunnel experiment in the National Transonic Facility at the NASA Langley Research Center. Previous work has shown that the measured onset of laminar-turbulent transition during the experiments can be correlated with the linear amplification of Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) and stationary crossflow (CF) instabilities in the swept wing boundary layer. However, a significant scatter (<i>N</i> ∈ (4,9)) was observed in the values of the logarithmic amplification factor along the measured transition front. This previous analysis was based on an approximate basic state (based on a boundary layer code with conical flow approximation) and parallel stability computations without surface curvature effects. Here, we examine the effects of these various approximations with the goal of quantifying the resulting changes in the N-factor correlations. Specifically, both linear stability theory (LST) and the parabolized stability equations (PSE)are used in conjunction with an accurate definition of the laminar boundary layer flow as computed with a Navier-Stokes solver with a Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) based turbulence model within the turbulent parts of the flow. Furthermore, the effects of instability wave propagation within a fully three-dimensional boundary layer are also evaluated by integrating the disturbance growth rates along suitably chosen, curvilinear (i.e., nonplanar) propagation trajectories.

In this systematic study, we evaluate the trace element composition of ordinary chondrites from the Antarctic cold desert, and Atacama (Chile) and Lut (Iran) hot deserts, with an emphasis on rare earth elements (REE). Our data confirms that terrestrial weathering of meteorites in hot deserts changes their trace element (Sr, Ba, REE, Hf, Th, and U) concentrations. However, weathering effects in majority of Antarctic samples are limited to slight Ba, REE, Hf, and Th depletions and in some case to U enrichment. In comparison to the Antarctic meteorites, hot desert samples show greater disturbances and REE fractionation relative to the average fall values. We measured the Sm-Nd isotopic composition of the hot desert meteorites that have heavily affected REE compositions. Our Sm-Nd isotopic data show a significant effect of terrestrial weathering evidenced by non-CHUR (147)Sm/(144)Nd and (143)Nd/(144)Nd ratios. Measurements show a higher variation and lower values of (147)Sm/(144)Nd for the Atacama samples than those from the Lut Desert. Deviations from CHUR (147)Sm/(144)Nd value are in positive accordance with the degree of La/Lu fractionation caused by weathering. The ɛNd values of Atacama and Lut deserts meteorites range from −2.20 to +1.61, which is wider than the −1.07 to +0.64 range for falls. We suggest that disturbance of primary Sm/Nd ratios resulting from mixing with terrestrial components originating from soil during weathering is responsible for lower (147)Sm/(144)Nd ratio in these meteorites. The majority of the Atacama meteorites regardless of their weathering degrees have their REE compositions and ɛNd affected by terrestrial contamination. Both (147)Sm/(144)Nd ratio and ɛNd values show no straightforward relationship with weathering degree. However, in both cases the samples with the highest negative isotopic disturbances are H chondrites from the Atacama and Lut deserts. In addition, Ba concentration shows a negative correlation with (147)Sm/(144)Nd ratio. Care must be taken into account while dealing with samples collected from hot deserts, even fresh-looking ones."

Moments include centroid location, aspect ratio, angle, and “excess kurtosis” (measuring how far the shape is from elliptical) for an equivalent ellipse with the same area as the ASMA. Key results are robust among the three modern reanalyses studied. The climatological ASMA is nearly elliptical, with its major axis aligned along its centroid latitude and a typical aspect ratio of ∼5–8.   The ASMA centroid shifts northward with height, northward and westward during development, and in the opposite direction as it weakens. New evidence finding no obvious climatological bimodality in the ASMA reinforces similar suggestions from previous studies using modern reanalyses.  Most trends in ASMA moments are not statistically significant.  ASMA area and duration, however, increased  significantly  during  1979–2018;  the  1958–2018  record  analyzed for one reanalysis suggests that these trends may have accelerated in recent decades.  ASMA centroid latitude is significantly positively (negatively) correlated with subtropical jet core latitude (altitude), and significantly negatively correlated with concurrent ENSO; these results are consistent with and extend previous work relating monsoon intensity, ENSO, and jet shifts. ASMA area is significantly positively correlated with the MEI ENSO index two months previously. These results improve our understanding of the ASMA using consistently defined diagnostics of its size, geometry, interannual variability, and trends that have not previously been analyzed."

The Catchment model in the L4_SM algorithm is driven with ¼-degree, hourly surface meteorological forcing data from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS).  Outside of Africa and the high latitudes, GEOS precipitation is corrected using Climate Prediction Center Unified (CPCU) gauge-based, ½-degree, daily precipitation.  L4_SM soil moisture was previously shown to improve over land model-only estimates that use CPCU precipitation but no Tb assimilation (CPCU_SIM).  Here, we additionally examine the skill of model-only (CTRL) and Tb assimilation-only (SMAP_DA) estimates derived without CPCU precipitation.  Soil moisture is assessed versus in situ measurements in well-instrumented regions and globally through the Instrumental Variable (IV) method using independent soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Scatterometer.  At the in situ locations, SMAP_DA and CPCU_SIM have comparable soil moisture skill improvements relative to CTRL for the unbiased root-mean-square error (surface and root-zone) and correlation metrics (root-zone only).  In the global average, SMAP Tb assimilation increases the surface soil moisture anomaly correlation by 0.10-0.11 compared to an increase of 0.02-0.03 from the CPCU-based precipitation corrections.  The contrast is particularly strong in central Australia, where CPCU is known to have errors and observation-minus-forecast Tb residuals are larger when CPCU precipitation is used.  Validation versus streamflow measurements in the contiguous U.S. reveals that CPCU precipitation provides most of the skill gained in L4_SM runoff estimates over CTRL."

Part II: Precipitation Microphysics,"Tropical Storm Bill produced over 400 mmof rainfall to portions of southern Oklahoma from 16-20 June 2015, adding to the catastrophic urban and river flooding that occurred throughout the region in the month prior to landfall. The unprecedented excessive precipitation event that occurred across Oklahoma and Texas during May and June 2015 resulted in anomalously high soil moisture and latent heat fluxes over the region, acting to increase the available boundary layer moisture. Tropical Storm Bill progressed inland over the region of anomalous soil moisture and latent heat fluxes which helped maintain polarimetric radar signatures associated with tropical, warm rain events. Vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables such as Z(H), Z(DR), K(DP), and ρ(hv) were analyzed in time and space over Texas and Oklahoma. The profiles suggest that Tropical Storm Bill maintained warm rain signatures and collision-coalescence processes as it tracked hundreds of kilometers inland away from the landfall point consistent with tropical cyclone precipitation characteristics. Dual-frequency precipitation radar observations from the NASA GPM DPR were also analyzed post-landfall and showed similar signatures of collision-coalescence while Bill moved over north Texas, southern Oklahoma, eastern Missouri, and western Kentucky."

Using the high-top \Middle Atmosphere"" (MA) version of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE (E2.2-AP), we show that increased CO2 reduces the QBO period and weakens its amplitude, consistent with results from recent multimodel studies. The amplitude response is asymmetric, with the easterly phase weakening more than the westerly phase. Results from both coupled atmosphere{ocean and climatologically fixed sea surface temperature simulations link the period response to changes in parameterized convective gravity wave fluxes, whereas the amplitude changes are more closely tied to changes in tropical upwelling. Comparisons of simulations with and without ozone-dynamical feedbacks reveal that ozone feedbacks increase the QBO amplitude and period in pre-industrial control simulations, and reduce the response of the amplitude to increased CO2. The response of stratospheric tracers to projected changes in the QBO is also investigated. Similarity between results using fully interactive (trace gas and aerosol) versus linearized ozone chemical mechanisms suggests that the QBO response to CO2 does not depend on additional chemical feedbacks beyond those associated with ozone, which implies that projected QBO changes may be credibly represented using simplified stratospheric ozone schemes."

NASA first saw that infusing technology intoNASA programs required some means to assess technology maturity like flight readiness for a mission. Hence, a seven-point technology readiness level scale was developed in the mid-70s by a NASA researcher and later formally defined in 1989 (Sadin et al., 1989) that comprised of seven levels (See Table 1). These levels provided a definitive meaning of what complexity a research and technology development program should be followed. NASA recognized the approach as a useful way of an effective assessment of,and communication regarding the maturity of new technologies, using a simplistic figure of merit, the state of maturity of a technology-particularly, critical technology necessary to meet a mission/application objective"

Results show that CFDs demonstrate mean biases and differences in the probability of extreme events, with larger uncertainty around extreme precipitation and in regions where observational data for climate and crop systems are scarce. Countries where simulations correlate highly with reported FAO national production anomalies tend to have high correlations across most CFDs, whose influence we isolate using multi-GGCM ensembles for each CFD. Correlations compare favorably with the climate signal detected in other studies, although production in many countries is not primarily climate-limited (particularly for rice). Bias-adjusted CFDs most often were among the highest model-observation correlations, although all CFDs produced the highest correlation in at least one top-producing country. Analysis of larger multi-CFD-multi-GGCM ensembles (up to 91 members) shows benefits over the use of smaller subset of models in some regions and farming systems, although bigger is not always better. Our analysis suggests that global assessments should prioritize ensembles based on multiple crop models over multiple CFDs as long as a top-performing CFD is utilized for the focus region."

These ground boards are used to provide  an  acoustically  hard  reflecting  surface,  limiting  the  effects  of  the  potentially  absorptive ground local to the test location. The microphone location is also specified to be offset from the center  of  the  board  to  limit  the  effects  of  acoustic  diffraction  off  the  board  edge.  In  order  to determine  the  effects  of  the  ground  board  on  the  measured  acoustic  signal,  a  comprehensive measurement  campaign  was  undertaken  at  NASA  Langley  Research  Center.  The  experimental setup included multiple ground board configurations placed on top of a sand pit, in an otherwise anechoic chamber. Ground board configurations included a microphone inverted and offset over the round ground board and a microphone offset and flush mounted in the ground board.White noise was  then  used  to  investigate  the  ground  board  effects  on  the  recorded  signal.  Normal impedance measurements were also acquired to determine the reflection coefficients of the sand and ground boards. Experimental results are discussed, along with implications for future research and development.Results indicate that both microphone configurations perform adequately up to 10 kHz. When the ground substrate is a soft material and the sound comes in at angles near grazing incidence the sound energy is attenuated above 1 kHz. Additionally, the plastic material used to construct the ground boards was found to be acoustically hard between 0.1 –3.0 kHz, and likely extending to higher frequencies."

Fol-lowing and extending the physics modeling and Cherenkov signal simulations performed in [1], thisscheme encompasses a new, state-of-the-art computation of the muon neutrino propagation insidethe Earth and the contribution to theτ-lepton muon decay channel.  The modeling takes into ac-count all possibleτ-lepton decay and muon energy loss channels that feed the optical Cherenkovemission,  produced by both tau and muon initiated EASs.  The EAS modeling uses the electronenergy, angular, and lateral distributions in the EAS and their evolution as well as the wavelengthdependence of the Cherenkov emission and its atmospheric attenuation.  The results presented hereare focused on the detection capabilities of sub-orbital (balloon-borne) and orbital (satellite) basedinstruments.  The latter case was calculated for POEMMAato compare to that presented in [1],specifically including the muon-decay channel ofτ-leptons and the muonic EAS Cherenkov signalfrom  muon  neutrino  interactions  in  the  Earth.   By  detailing  all  these  individual  contributions  tothe  optical  Cherenkov  emission  and  detection,  we  show  how  the  ensemble  that  includes  muonicchannels provides a large detection capability for space-based, high-energy cosmic neutrino detec-tion.  Specifically, we show that for neutrino energies∼<10 PeV, the upward-EAS sensitivity due tomuon neutrino interactions in the Earth begin to dominate over that for tau neutrino interactions,effectively extending the neutrino sensitivity to lower energies."

The post-test inspection of the thruster hardware began shortly afterwards with a combination of non-destructive and destructive analysis techniques, and is presently nearing completion.   This paper presents relevant results of the post-test inspection for the discharge chamber as well as other miscellaneous components such as the high-voltage propellant isolators and electrical cabling.  Comparison of magnetic field measurements taken during pretest and post-test inspections indicate that the field strength did not degrade, consistent with performance data obtained during the test.  Inspection of discharge chamber mesh samples show a deposition coating primarily composed of grid material that is approximately 15 μm in thickness.  This thickness is well within the retention capability of the mesh and is therefore not expected to present any issues.   Approximately 3.1 grams of deposition flakes were found at the bottom of the discharge chamber, composed primarily of grid material and carbon.   Calculated size histograms of these flakes indicate that 99% have a maximum dimension of 200 μm or smaller, which is significantly less than the ion optics grid gap.   Larger flakes that are capable of causing a grid-to-grid short will be analyzed to determine if their formation will occur in flight or is a facility effect.   The high-voltage propellant isolators as well as numerous other electrical insulators were inspected and no evidence of arcing or any other issues were found."

Analytical modeling and modern plasma simulations suggest that plasma quasi-neutrality could possibly be broken close to the terminator obstruction as solar wind electrons expand into the wake ahead of the ions, leading to the formation of a standing (time-stationary) double layer. The objective of the Terminator Double Layer Explorer is to extend the fundamental understanding of the plasma expansion into the trailing near-vacuum wake region by (1) identifying any plasma expansion density anomalies at low altitudes near the terminator wake initiation region, (2) assessing the highly variable solar wind's effect on the low-altitude wake region, and (3) determining if plasma neutrality is maintained or lost during passages through the low-altitude expansion region. The mission concept uses a propulsion-driven CubeSat with ion spectrometer and plasma wave system in elliptical orbit about the Moon with periselene near the terminator. Over the course of the mission, the periselene decreases, placing the CubeSat ever closer to the terminator wake initiation location and the possible nonneutral region."

Earth observation (EO) data can fill key knowledge gaps, and can be rapidly used in settings with lower analytical capacity. In this study, we describe a novel series of methods designed to analyze landslide susceptibility, hazard and exposure in the region in and around the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where limited data is juxtaposed with a major humanitarian crisis. We demonstrate that a high degree of accuracy is possible even when estimating susceptibility of relatively small landslides. In the context of this example, we also explore how estimates of landslide hazard and exposure are most beneficial to decisions made by humanitarian stakeholders relevant to natural hazards and risk. The unique opportunity to work alongside humanitarian end‐users has allowed us to produce focused products that can be tested while in development. In particular, we stress the importance of communicating the difference between a landslide “early warning system”—for which satellite data may be unsuitable at local scales—and a model that provides relative hazard estimates, where EO may be valuable. The toolbox of methods presented here could be used to generate landslide hazard and exposure maps in other data‐poor regions around the globe."

Pre-launch pointing alignment errors and post-launch pointing alignment variation result in large geolocation errors that must be calibrated on orbit. In addition, the changing sun-orbit geometry causes thermal-mechanical forced laser frame alignment variations at the orbit period and trends from days, weeks and months. Early mission analysis computed precise post-launch laser beam alignment calibration. The alignment calibration was uploaded to the spacecraft and enabled the pointing control performance to achieve 4.4 ± 6.0 m, a significant improvement over the 45 m (1 σ) mission requirement. Laser frame alignment calibrations are used to reduce the alignment bias and time variation, as well as the orbital variation contributions to geolocation knowledge error from 6 m to 1.7 m (1 σ). Relative beam alignment of the six beams is calibrated and shown to contribute between 0.5 ± 0.1 m and 2.4 ± 0.2 m of remaining geolocation knowledge error. Independent geolocation assessment based on comparison to high-resolution digital elevation models agrees well with the calibration geolocation error estimates. The analysis demonstrates the ICESat-2 mission is performing far better than its geolocation knowledge requirement of 6.5 m (1 σ) after the laser frame alignment bias variation and orbital variation calibrations have been applied. Remaining geolocation error is beam dependent and ranges from 2.5 m for beam 6 to 4.4 m for beam 2 (mean + 1 σ)."

In sub-Saharan Africa, fossil fuel combustion has nearly doubled since 2000. At the same time, landscape biomass burning—another important NOx source—has declined in north equatorial Africa, attributed to changes in climate and anthropogenic fire management. Here, we use satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) and burned area to identify NO2 trends and drivers over Africa. Across the northern ecosystems where biomass burning occurs—home to hundreds of millions of people—mean annual tropospheric NO2 VCDs decreased by 4.5% from 2005 through 2017 during the dry season of November through February. Reductions in burned area explained the majority of variation in NO2 VCDs, though changes in fossil fuel emissions also explained some variation. Over Africa’s biomass burning regions, raising mean GDP density (USD·km−2) above its lowest levels is associated with lower NO2 VCDs during the dry season, suggesting that economic development mitigates net NO2 emissions during these highly polluted months. In contrast to the traditional notion that socioeconomic development increases air pollutant concentrations in low- and middle-income nations, our results suggest that countries in Africa’s northern biomass-burning region are following a different pathway during the fire season, resulting in potential air quality benefits. However, these benefits may be lost with increasing fossil fuel use and are absent during the rainy season."

How REM impacts cirrus clouds is investigated in this paper, using bin microphysical model simulations and coincident data of the CloudSat and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellites. REM affects ice crystal spectrum with two types: radiative cooling and warming. Radiative cooling, as predicted by the bin model simulations, favors the formation of horizontally oriented ice crystals (HOICs), but radiative warming does not. Hence, a test of REM can be transformed to a test of HOICs, because HOICs can be measured by the microwave polarization observations of the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) at 166 GHz. 

To analyze the GMI data for their HOIC distribution, clouds are sorted into four groups with different optical depth and altitude, based on the radiative cooling/warming ratio (or eta) computed with satellite-retrieved ice water content. Their HOIC distributions (e.g., the mid-level thick clouds have more HOICs than the high-level ones) agree well with those predicted by the bin model simulations. The general agreement between the GMI observations and bin model simulations suggests that REM is common in cirrus clouds and impacts cirrus clouds significantly."

On Earth, subsurface interactions of gypsum with chlorides and oxychlorine salts wreak havoc: instigating sinkholes, cave collapse, debris flows, and upheave. Here, we illustrate (i) the disruptive potential of sulfate-chloride reactions in laboratory soil crust experiments, (ii) the formation of thin films of mixed ice-liquid water “slush” at −40° to −20°C on salty Mars analog grains, (iii) how mixtures of sulfates and chlorine
salts affect their solubilities in low-temperature environments, and (iv) how these salt brines could be contributing to RSL formation on Mars. Our results demonstrate that interactions of sulfates and chlorine salts in fine-grained soils on Mars could absorb water, expand, deliquesce, cause subsidence, form crusts, disrupt surfaces, and ultimately produce landslides after dust loading on these unstable surfaces."

It collected its first Earth limb measurement on 10 January 2012 and continues to provide daily global measurements  of  ozone  and  aerosol  profiles  from  the  cloud  top  up  to  60  and  40 km,  respectively. The relatively high vertical and spatial sampling allow detection and tracking of sporadic events when aerosol particles are injected into the stratosphere, such as volcanic eruptions or pyro cumulonimbus (PyroCb) events. In this paper we discuss the newly released Version 2.0 OMPS multi-wavelength aerosol extinction coefficient retrieval algorithm. The algorithm now produces aerosol extinction profiles at 510, 600, 674, 745, 869 and 997 nm wavelengths. The OMPS LP Version  2.0  data  products  are  compared to the SAGE III/ISS, OSIRIS and CALIPSO missions and shown to be of good quality  and  suitable  for  scientific  studies.  The  comparison shows  significant  improvements  in  the  OMPS  LP  retrieval performance in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and at lower altitudes. These improvements arise from use of the longer wavelengths,  in  contrast  with  the  V1.0  and  V1.5  OMPS aerosol  retrieval  algorithms,  which  used  radiances  only  at 675 nm  and  therefore  had  limited  sensitivity  in  those  regions.  In  particular,  the  extinction  coefficients  at  745,  869 and 997 nm are shown to be the most accurate, with relative accuracies  and  precisions  close  to  10%  and  15%,  respectively, while the 675 nm relative accuracy and precision are on  the  order  of  20%.  The  510 nm  extinction  coefficient  is shown to have limited accuracy in the SH and is only recommended for use between 20–24 km and only in the Northern Hemisphere. The V2.0 retrieval algorithm has been applied to the complete set of OMPS LP measurements, and the new dataset is publicly available."

New to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) is the Tier 1 Last Interglacial experiment for 127 000 years ago (lig127k), designed to address the climate responses to stronger orbital forcing than the midHolocene experiment, using the same state-of-the-art models as for the future and following a common experimental protocol. Here we present a first analysis of a multi-model ensemble of 17 climate models, all of which have completed the CMIP6 DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) experiments. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of these models varies from 1.8 to 5.6°C. The seasonal character of the insolation anomalies results in strong summer warming over the Northern Hemisphere continents in the lig127k ensemble as compared to the CMIP6 piControl and much-reduced minimum sea ice in the Arctic. The multi-model results indicate enhanced summer monsoonal precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere and reductions in the Southern Hemisphere. These responses are greater in the lig127k than the CMIP6 midHolocene simulations as expected from the larger insolation anomalies at 127 than 6 ka.

New synthesis for surface temperature and precipitation, targeted for 127 ka, have been developed for comparison to the multi-model ensemble. The lig127k model ensemble and data reconstructions are in good agreement for summer temperature anomalies over Canada, Scandinavia, and the North Atlantic and for precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere continents. The model–data comparisons and mismatches point to further study of the sensitivity of the simulations to uncertainties in the boundary conditions and of the uncertainties and sparse coverage in current proxy reconstructions.

The CMIP6–Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP4) lig127k simulations, in combination with the proxy record, improve our confidence in future projections of monsoons, surface temperature, and Arctic sea ice, thus providing a key target for model evaluation and optimization."

innovative solutions must be developed to meet noise and efficiency

team of academic and industrial experts exploring for the first time
the potential of small real-time geometric outer mold line (OML)
reconfigurations to minimize sonic boom signatures and aircraft drag in
response to changing ambient conditions, thereby enabling noise-compliant
overland supersonic flight. The team utilizes recent advances in supersonic
computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods, new noise prediction tools, and
new design approaches to consider embedded highly energy-dense shape
memory alloy (SMA) actuators for local shape modifications to an SST aircraft
leading to optimal low boom signature and low drag in different
environments. This university-led program will provide strategic leadership
toward technology convergence that advances NASA's Aerospace Research
Mission Directorate's (ARMD) research objectives with regard to Thrust 2:
“Innovation in Commercial Supersonic Aircraft” by exploring for the first time
enabling low-boom operation across a range of flight conditions via structural
adaptivity, and will promote education of the next generation of engineers.
The overall research strategy is to pursue three critical areas: the design of
configurations for reducing boom, SMA material development and modeling,
and technology feasibility demonstration in a relevant environment. Initially,
the team will identify potential applications where structure or geometry
adaptivity provides a benefit in noise or drag across the entire flight envelope.
For selected applications/structural locations, required OML geometry changes
will be determined based on analysis of sonic boom ground signature and drag
reduction using new design tools, trade studies, and atmospheric sensing
techniques. Designs will be developed and evaluated against requirements on
loading, stroke length, and operational temperature. New alloy formulations
will be developed tailored for both autonomous and controlled actuation
modes. As the SMA material development matures, integrated system-level
factors will be investigated. Optimized designs for small-scale distributed
adaptivity applications of maximum benefit will then be matured and tested,
moving toward demonstration of the innovative technology approaches at a
TRL 4-5 and showing that sonic booms can be reduced by reconfiguration on
demand."

Using boxplots and scatterplots, we examine how the different molecular species are distributed among the comet population, while by means of pie charts we investigate the relative proportions of these molecular species in each comet. We compare these results with the orbital parametersof the selected targets in order to identify trends related to the dynamical history of each comet. In this way, we identify at least three chemical classes based mainly on relative abundances of CO, CH3OH, CH4, C2H6, HCN and NH3. The combination of relative abundances and orbital parameters is then compared with chemical models of planetary system formation and may offer an alternative approach to investigate the origin and evolution of the material in cometary nuclei.Our study also confirms the need to add more objects to our sample in order to improve the statistics, especially for hyper-volatiles (i.e. CH4and CO) in Jupiter Family comets."

Both oxygen/hydrogen chemical propulsion and nuclear electric propulsion with 500 kilowatt electric (kWe) to 10 megawatt electric (MWe) reactors will be assessed. The initial masses, propellant masses, and trip times for a variety of space vehicle payload masses will be compared. For high energy orbital transfer, the nuclear electric propulsion vehicles required a small fraction of the propellant mass over oxygen/hydrogen orbital transfer vehicles (OTVs). The moons, Phobos and Deimos, may hold resources for refueling future space vehicles. In-situ resource utilization (ISRU) can be a powerful method of reducing Earth dependence on space vehicle propellants, liquid water, and breathing gases. Historical studies have identified the potential of water in carbonaceous chondrites on the moons. The moon-derived propellants OTVs that move payloads between the moons and to other important operational Mars orbits. Also, the propellants have been suggested to support reusable Mars landers. To extract the water, the mined mass, its volume and the mining time were estimated. The water mass fraction may be as low as 2x10<sup>−4</sup>.

We examine different model options on drought reconstruction including optional representation of groundwater and dynamic vegetation phenology. Over our 104-year reconstruction period, we identify 12 great droughts that each covered at least 36% of CONUS and lasted for at least 5 months. The great droughts tend to have smaller areas when groundwater and/or dynamic vegetation are included in the model configuration. We detect a small decreasing trend in dry area coverage over CONUS in all configurations. We identify 45 major droughts in the baseline (with a dry area coverage greater than 23.6% of CONUS) that are, on average, somewhat less severe than great droughts. We find that representation of groundwater tends to increase drought duration for both great and major droughts, primarily by leading to earlier drought onset (some due to short-lived recovery from a previous drought) or later demise (groundwater anomalies lag precipitation anomalies). In contrast, representation of dynamic vegetation tends to shorten major droughts duration, primarily due to earlier drought demise ( closed stoma or dead vegetation reduces ET loss during droughts). On a regional basis, the U.S. Southwest (Southeast) has the longest (shortest) major drought durations. Consistent with earlier work, dry area coverage in all subregions except the Southwest has decreased. The effects of groundwater and dynamic vegetation vary regionally due to differences in groundwater depths (hence connectivity with the surface) and vegetation types."

In North America, decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme winter cold events are expected to allow the poleward range expansion of many cold-sensitive tropical organisms, sometimes at the expense of temperate organisms. Although ecologists have long noted the critical ecological role of winter cold temperature extremes in tropical–temperate transition zones, the ecological effects of extreme cold events have been understudied, and the influence of warming winter temperatures has too often been left out of climate change vulnerability assessments. Here, we examine the influence of extreme cold events on the northward range limits of a diverse group of tropical organisms, including terrestrial plants, coastal wetland plants, coastal fishes, sea turtles, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, manatees, and insects. For these organisms, extreme cold events can lead to major physiological damage or landscape-scale mass mortality. Conversely, the absence of extreme cold events can foster population growth, range expansion, and ecological regime shifts. We discuss the effects of warming winters on species and ecosystems in tropical–temperate transition zones. In the 21st century, climate change-induced decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme cold events are expected to facilitate the poleward range expansion of many tropical species. Our review highlights critical knowledge gaps for advancing understanding of the ecological implications of the tropicalization of temperate ecosystems in North America."

The instrument and constellation designs were performed in the context of the Midwave Infrared Sounding of Temperature and humidity in a Constellation for Winds (MISTiC Winds). The Global Modeling and Assimilation Office OSSE system, which includes a full suite of operational meteorological observations, served as the control. To illustrate the potential impact of this observing strategy, two experiments were performed by adding the new simulated observations to the control. First, perfect (error free) simulated AMVs and radiances were assimilated. Second, the data were made imperfect by adding realistic modeled errors to the AMVs and radiances that were assimilated. The experimentation showed beneficial impacts on both the mass and wind fields, as based on analysis verification, forecast verification, and the assessment of the observations using the forecast sensitivity to observation impact (FSOI) metric. In all variables and metrics, the impacts of the imperfect observations were smaller than those of the perfect observations, although much of the positive benefit was retained. The FSOI metric illustrated two key points. First, the largest impacts were seen in the middle troposphere AMVs, which is a targeted capability of the constellation strategy. Second, the addition of modeled errors showed that the assimilation system was unable to fully exploit the 4.3-μm carbon dioxide absorption radiances."

This protocol was standardized by the RFC 5050’s definition of BPv6 and was later standardized and refined for space operations by the CCSDS Bundle Protocol Specification. After the release of RFC 5050, a variety of implementations and missions used BPv6 and noted several improvements that could be made to the protocol. These improvements culminated in a push to release a new protocol version, BPv7. Unfortunately, the vast improvements and difference in encoding that separates BPv7 from BPv6 also makes the two versions inherently incompatible. Consequently, there is an issue implementing BPv7 in existing systems while continuing support for BPv6 implementations. In response to this issue, two solutions emerge: (1) Bundle-in-Bundle Encapsulation (BIBE), a capability that wraps a bundle in another bundle for shipping between intermediary nodes, and (2) version agnostic DTN implementations. These concepts have been proven out in the MSFC DTN implementation known as DTNME."

The algorithm applies land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index from Moderate Resolution  Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at higher spatial resolution to estimate relative soil wetness within a coarse SMAP grid -this MODIS-derived relative wetness is then used to produce the downscaled SMAP SM. Results from the algorithm were evaluated in terms of their spatiotemporal coverage and accuracy using in  situ measurements from SMAP Core Validation Sites (CVS), the US Department of Agriculture Soil Climate Analysis Network (USDA-SCAN), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Reference Network(NOAA-CRN). Results were also compared with the baselineSPL2SMPE and the SMAP/Sentinel-1 (SPL2SMAPS) 1kmproduct. Overall, the unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE)of the disaggregated SM at the CVS using the TI approach is approximately 0.04 m3=m3, which is the SMAP mission requirement for the baseline products. The TI approach out performs the SMAP/Sentinel SL2SMAPS 1km product by approximately0.02 m3=m3. Over the agriculture/crop areas from SCAN and CRN sparse network stations, the TI approach exhibits better ubRMSE compared to SPL2SMPE andSPL2SMAPS byabout0.01 and 0.02 m3=m3, indicating its advantage in these areas.

The guidelines are developed through a combination of literature review and internal research at NASA GRC that sought to develop an understanding of how LDI geometry affects NOx emissions, minimum stable f/a, and combustion dynamics. Key objectives are to improve low power operability by reducing the fuel/air ratio achievable with the SV-LDI concept and to reduce NOx emissions for both the subsonic landing-takeoff cycle and supersonic cruise conditions. The design of any combustion system will be a set of compromises between flame stability and decreasing combustion emissions. This document is to serve as a guide for selecting the best options given the overall mission. This document is organized as follows. In section 1, we introduce and describe the SV-LDI concept as a way to reduce NOx emissions. Section 2 provides descriptions of the individual components that make up a single swirl-venturi LDI element — the venturi, swirler, and fuel injector and their primary purposes. Considerable focus is applied to how changes on the air side components affect the flow field. Section 3 examines variations within a single SV-LDI element swirler: blade thickness, presence of a diffuser section, position of fuel nozzle, et cetera. We include examples from the literature to emphasize key aspects of these changes. In Section 4 we consider the interaction of a single element with the combustion chamber and with neighboring elements. In Section 5, we look at fuel staging effects on emissions, combustion efficiency, and combustion dynamics. Throughout these sections, we will highlight any findings we consider universal, and in Section 6 we consolidate those findings to provide guidelines for use in SV-LDI designs."

The intercomparison employed a constrained box model and utilised tropospheric trace gas composition data for the pre-industrial times at ninety mid-latitude surface locations. Incremental additions of four organic compounds: methane, ethane, acetone and propane, were used to perturb the constrained box model and generate responses in hydroxyl radicals and tropospheric ozone at each location and with each chemical mechanism. Although the responses agreed well across the chemical mechanisms from the selected earth system and other global tropospheric chemistry-transport models, there were differences in the detailed responses between the chemical mechanisms that could be tracked down by sensitivity analysis to differences in the representation of C1–C3 chemistry. Inter-mechanism ranges in NOx compensation points were about 0.17 ± 0.12 when expressed relative to the inter-mechanism average. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis carried out with a single chemical mechanism put the intra-mechanism range a factor of three higher at 0.50 ± 0.12. Similar differences between inter-mechanism and intra-mechanism ranges were found for hydroxyl radical depletion but were up to a factor of six wider for ozone formation from incremental additions of organic compounds. The cause of the discrepancies between the inter- and intra-mechanism ranges was found to be the large uncertainties that are present in the laboratory determinations of the rate coefficients and product channel branching ratios of some key chemical reactions involving organic peroxy radicals and hydroperoxides. Whilst these large uncertainties are present in the laboratory determinations, there will be irreducible uncertainties in the predictions from the earth system and other chemistry-transport models of methane and tropospheric ozone trends since pre-industrial times and hence their contributions to the radiative forcing of climate change. Further definitive laboratory studies of the reaction rates and product yields of the reactions of the simple organic peroxy radicals and hydroperoxides are required to resolve and reduce current uncertainties in earth system and chemistry-transport model predictions."

ACCP is a project to define a satellite mission to be launched  late in the 2020’s to advance cloud and aerosol science, following the recommendations of the latest NASA Decadal Survey. The ACCP modeling workshop goal was to answer the following questions: 
1.	What will be the critical science questions for clouds and aerosols in 10 years?
2.	Where will simulations of clouds and aerosols across scales of space (process models to global) and time (nowcasting to climate prediction) be in 10 years?
3.	What data will be available from space? What data would provide the most benefit?
4.	What are the state of the art methods for confronting models with cloud and aerosol observations, including assimilation and climatological analysis techniques?

The virtual workshop was anchored by a series of pre-recorded talks.  Two days of synchronous sessions focused on discussion of the talks, along with small group breakout exercises. After an introduction to the ACCP concept came a panel discussing the future of modeling clouds and aerosols across scales. Participants were then asked to contribute their ideas. On the second day, there were two panel discussions. First came a discussion of the future of satellite observing systems. Second was a discussion of model-data synthesis methods. Finally, participants were asked to develop their own model-data synthesis proposal. The meeting began with an overview of the ACCP mission concept by Graeme Stephens (NASA-JPL). ACCP is a satellite mission for clouds and aerosols, likely anchored by advanced active lidar and radar systems in space, designed to observe detailed aerosol profile and type information, as well as cloud microphysics and dynamics. ACCP will integrate across sensors and observational types to get multi-spectral views of the same scenes, with better resolution than is available today. Launch is scheduled for 2027 or 2029. ACCP is being thought of as a comprehensive mission that may comprise more than one platform and more than one orbit plane (i.e., inclined and polar), with multiple combinations of sensors."

Body pointing was used by the Aerospace Corporation for CubeSats in LEO in NASA’s Optical Communications and Sensors Demonstration (OCSD) program. Computer simulations of this fine pointing capability have been applied previously to CubeSats in the OCSD program. In this paper, computer simulations of laser pointing using this telescope design are applied to CubeSats in LLO, at 100 km.  These CubeSats could form part of the LunaNet, the lunar communications and navigation network, part of the NASA ARTEMIS Program. With more accurate pointing, a laser beam with smaller divergence can be used.  For the case of the AeroCube-7B vehicle that was used in the OCSD program, computer simulations will show, for example, that the divergence of the output beam can be reduced from approximately 0.06° FWHM to 0.014°. For the proposed electro-optical system, reaction times to pointing changes and vibrations are on a nanosecond time scale, much faster than those for fine pointing systems that use moving parts such as fast steering mirrors, including MEMS, or that use quad-cell photodetectors to improve the body pointing of the CubeSat.  Other possible applications are to Optical Multiple Access (OMA)for simultaneously communicating with ground stations at different locations and to Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM)for increasing data rate transmission."

The primary goals are to increase awareness and consistency across the Agency, advance the practice and implementation of HSI principles, and provide invaluable information and guidance to HSI practitioners in the performance of their duties. 
Specific aims of this handbook are to define HSI, illustrate the value of HSI in programmatic decisions, demonstrate how HSI fits into the NASA project life cycle process, describe how HSI applies across all three NASA Technical Authorities, provide guidance on HSI processes and products, and provide helpful information on HSI resources within the NASA community.
Largely within the engineering community, a system is thought of as the integration or assemblance of hardware and software that together perform a function.  HSI considers a system to be the integration of hardware, software, humans, data, and processes, where the human in HSI refers to all personnel involved with a given system, including system owners, users/customers, operators, maintainers, assemblers, support personnel, logistics suppliers, training personnel, test personnel, and others.
This handbook should be used as a companion for implementing NPR 7123.1, Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements, the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, NASA directives, and any Center-specific handbooks and directives developed for implementing programs and projects. 
As of 2021, both NPR 7123.1 and NPR 7120.5 require HSI to be implemented within NASA technical efforts."

These limitations may be particularly problematic in understudied urban landscapes that often contain altered hydraulic properties. To better treat deficiencies in PTF performance, we addressed three objectives, which were to: 1) develop PTFs to predict urban K(n), 2) assess bulk density and coarse fragments as explanatory variables; and 3) evaluate the predictive capability of these PTFs by comparing their output to measured hydraulic conductivity values from three other studies of urban soil hydraulics. We used artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest (RF) approaches to predict urban K(n), with the training dataset including 307 tension infiltrometer tests and other measurements drawn from urban soil assessments in 11 U.S. cities. The PTFs utilized a hierarchy of inputs, starting with percentage sand, silt, clay, and then adding percentage coarse fragments and bulk density. The ANN models performed similar to the RF models, and all models exhibited similar or better predictive performance as models results collected from published articles. The inclusion of bulk density or coarse fragments did not improve accuracy over soil texture alone. Possible reasons for this result include low correlation between K(n) and bulk density and the exclusion of large voids during flow measurements with tension infiltrometers. The models have been made available as an open-source software package to encourage adoption by users working in urban systems."

Quantifying these changes requires a business-as-usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) at 5,756 observation sites in countries from January through June 2020. Reductions in NO2 coincide with timing and intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On average, NO2 concentrations were (13-23) % lower than business as usual from February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the business-as-usual estimate. NO2 reductions in Europe and the US have been more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that the global NOx (NO+NO2) emission reduction during the first 6 months of 2020 amounted to 3.1 (2.6-3.6) TgN, equivalent to 5.5(4.7-6.4) % of the annual anthropogenic total. The response of surface O3 is complicated by competing influences of non-linear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O3 increased by up to 50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O3 between February -June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a flattening of the O3 diurnal cycle with an increase in nighttime ozone due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a reduction in photochemical production."

They are increasingly being used in major commercial aircraft programs. However, current processing methods can lead to defects in composite parts, which must be detected using post-manufacturing inspection methods. Porosity (i.e., pores, voids) is a critical defect from the cure process that is detrimental to performance of the composite part. It is therefore necessary to understand and eliminate the formation of porosity defects. At NASA Langley Research Center, an in-situ cure monitoring system was developed to detect porosity defects as they form in real-time inside an autoclave. A capability to directly detect and localize porosity within a composite during cure did not exist before.

This study is focused on an elevated-temperature ultrasonic inspection system to detect porosity defects in composites during autoclave cure. The ultrasonic inspection system operated inside an autoclave within an enclosure cooled by intermittent liquid nitrogen (LN_2) injections. A high-temperature, 2.25 MHz, transducer transmitted ultrasonic waves through the tool plate and into the composite part and measured the amplitude and time of flight of the reflected waves with a 1 mm × 1 mm step size/areal resolution. Porosity was observed via the ultrasonic reflections, which experienced increased attenuation in regions of high porosity. Distinct regions of increased porosity were present due to uneven pressure across the panel, which was driven by an intentional misfit between the flat caul plate and the tapered composite panel with ply drops. The results were validated by post-cure ultrasonic inspection and micrographs. The in-situ inspection system was able to successfully provide porosity detection and localization in the tapered ply-drop panel. The successful results indicate the promise of this system for future implementation in the manufacturing of composite structures for aerospace applications."

However, despite their prevalence, little is known about these materials or what their presence implies for the history of Mars. The X-ray amorphous component of the martian soil in Gale crater has an X-ray diffraction pattern that can be partially fit with allophane (approximately Al2O3•(SiO2)1.3-2•(H2O)2.5-3), and the low-temperature water release data are consistent with allophane. The chemical data from Gale crater suggest that other silicate materials similar to allophane, such as Fe-substituted allophane (approximately (Fe2O3)0.01-0.5(Al2O3)0.5-0.99•(SiO2)2•3H2O), may also be present. In order to investigate the properties of these potential poorly crystalline components of the martian soil, Fe-free allophane (Fe:Al = 0), Fe-poor allophane (Fe:Al = 1:99), and Fe-rich allophane (Fe:Al = 1:1) were synthesized and then characterized using electron microscopy and Mars-relevant techniques, including infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and evolved gas analysis. Dissolution experiments were performed at acidic (initial pH values pH0 = 3.01, pH0 = 5.04), near-neutral (pH0 = 6.99), and alkaline (pH0 = 10.4) conditions in order to determine dissolution kinetics and alteration phases for these poorly crystalline materials. Dissolution rates (rdiss), based on the rate of Si release into solution, show that these poorly crystalline materials dissolve approximately an order of magnitude faster than crystalline phases with similar compositions at all pH conditions. For Fe-free allophane, logrdiss =   -10.65 – 0.15 × pH; for Fe-poor allophane, logrdiss = -10.35 – 0.22 × pH; and for Fe-rich allophane, logrdiss = -11.46 – 0.042 × pH at 25°C, where rdiss has the units of mol m-2 s-1. The formation of incipient phyllosilicate-like phases was detected in Fe-free and Fe-rich allophane reacted in aqueous solutions with pH0 = 10.4 (steady-state pH ≈ 8). Mars-analog instrument analyses demonstrate that Fe-free allophane, Fe-poor allophane, and Fe-rich allophane are appropriate analogs for silicate phases in the martian amorphous soil component. Therefore, similar materials on Mars must have had limited interaction with liquid water since their formation. Combined with chemical changes expected from weathering, such as phyllosilicate formation, the rapid alteration of these poorly crystalline materials may be a useful tool for evaluating the extent of aqueous alteration in returned samples of martian soils."

The  equatorial  parts  of  Ceres produce  80%  more  ejecta  than  the  polar  regions  due  to  the  large  impact  velocity  of long-period comets.  Mass flux, energy flux, and ejecta production vary seasonally by a factor of (Replaced: a few replaced with: 3–7) due to the inclined eccentric orbit.

On average Mercury is subjected to a 50× larger mass flux and generates 700× more ejecta than Ceres, while the lunar mass flux is 10× larger, and the ejecta generation is  30× larger  than  on  Ceres.   For  these  reasons,  we  find  that  meteoroid  impacts  are an unlikely candidate for the production of a water exosphere or significant excavation of  surface  features.   The  surface  turnover  rate  from  the  micro-meteoroid  populations considered is estimated to be 1.25 Myr on Ceres."

Even if we take advantage of the extreme instrumental precision conferred by NEID, it will be difficult to disentangle the weak (~10 cm/s) signals induced by such low-mass, long-period exoplanets from stellar noise for all but the quietest host stars. In this work, we present a set of quantitative selection metrics which we use to identify an initial NETS target list consisting of stars conducive to the detection of exoplanets in the regime of interest.

Radiative transfer modeling of NOMAD observations taken in the nadir geometry enable the seasonal and global-scale variations of carbon monoxide gas in the Martian atmosphere to be characterized. These retrievals show the column-averaged volume mixing ratio of carbon monoxide to be about 800 ppmv, with significant variations at high latitudes caused by the condensation and sublimation of the background CO2 gas. Near summer solstice in each hemisphere, the CO volume mixing ratio falls to 400 ppmv in the south and 600 ppmv in the north. At low latitudes, carbon monoxide volume mixing ratio inversely follows the annual cycle of surface pressure. Comparison of our retrieved CO volume mixing ratio against that computed by the GEM-Mars general circulation model reveals a good match in their respective seasonal and spatial trends, and can provide insight into the physical processes that control the distribution of CO gas in the current Martian atmosphere."

Many properties, such as the magnetic field density and mass density, follow conservation laws and vary systematically with changes in the size of a CME. We present ANTEATR-PARADE, the newest version of the ANTEATR arrival time model, which now includes physics-driven changes in the size and shape of both the CME's central axis and its cross section. Internal magnetic and thermal and external drag forces affect the acceleration of the CME in different directions, inducing asymmetries between the radial and perpendicular directions. These improvements should lead to more realistic CME velocities, both bulk and expansion, sizes and shapes, and internal properties. We present the model details, an initial illustration of the general behavior, and a study of the relative importance of the different forces. The model shows a pancaking of both the cross section and central axis of the CME so that their radial extent becomes smaller than their extent in the perpendicular direction. We find that the initial velocities, drag, any form of cross section expansion, and the precise form of thermal expansion have strong effects. The results are less sensitive to axial forces and the specific form of the cross section expansion."

In this approach, photoionization and photoexcitation are included in more detail, and the production of electronically-excited (suprathermal) species is explic- itly considered. In addition, we have included non-thermal, non-diffusive chemistry to account for the low-temperature characteristic of cold cores. As an initial test of our method, we have simulated two previous experimental studies involving the UV irradiation of pure solid O2. In contrast to previous solid-state astrochemical model calculations which have used gas-phase photoabsorption cross-sections, we have em- ployed solid-state cross-sections in our calculations. This method allows the model to be tested using well-constrained experiments rather than poorly constrained gas-phase abundances in ISM regions. Our results indicate that inclusion of non-thermal reac- tions and suprathermal species allows for reproduction of low-temperature solid-phase photoprocessing that simulate interstellar ices within cold ( 10 K) dense cores such as TMC-1."

Here we evaluate the large-scale geophysical variability of the SAGE III/ISS water vapor measurements for the first 3 years of observations (2017–2020) as part of data validation for retrieval version 5.1 (v5.1). Detailed comparisons of SAGE III/ISS v5.1 with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) version 5 retrievals show overall excellent agreement in terms of seasonal mean structure and large-scale variability. SAGE III/ISS data capture the well-known seasonal variations in water vapor including the vertically propagating “tape recorder” in the tropics and lower stratospheric maxima linked to the NH summer monsoons. The high vertical resolution (∼2 km) measurements from SAGE III/ISS demonstrate contributions of the monsoons to the wet phase of “tape recorder” during the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer. Interannual variations over the short data record are also consistent between SAGE III/ISS and MLS in the stratosphere between 16 and 30 km. We furthermore evaluate large-scale variations in relative humidity (RH) derived from the high vertical resolution SAGE III/ISS water vapor measurements, highlighting the detailed seasonal behavior and links to thermal structure near the tropical tropopause. Spatial distributions of RH at the cold point tropopause (CPT) show a close link between high RH and the minimum CPT temperature in both the NH winter and summer, consistent with temperature control of water vapor near the tropopause."

Realizability checking is essential to ensure that an implementation can be constructed that satisfies the requirements. We propose a framework that supports users in the non-trivial task of developing realizable requirements. Our framework uses architectural information to automatically de-compose a set of requirements into subsets that can be analyzed separately, and therefore more efficiently.  It then integrates existing algorithms in order to detect unrealizability, identify minimal sets of conflicting requirements, and compute counterexamples. The capability to focus on minimal conflict sets is key for localizing and correcting the sources of unrealizability. Our approach supports this process by enabling users to interactively visualize and explore the produced conflict sets and counterexamples. We have implemented our framework in the open-source Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET), and have used it on a variety of industrial-level case studies, showcasing the strengths of our approach in terms of raw performance, as well as diagnostic potential."

Based on this work, EUS partnered with significant leveraged funding. A portable, self-contained test bed was also fabricated to support validation of the new method.   In FY20, this project focused on the formal validation of ethane’s performance as an aerodynamic simulant as well as the development of the analytical and hardware infrastructure required to carry out that task. The test bed was activated, a series of heated-ethane tests on one or more rocket/diffuser configurations were conducted, and characterizations of the performance of the ethane simulation compared to hot-fire were performed.  A series of 127 tests were conducted on 13 aerodynamic configurations to evaluate ethane’s performance as a simulant. It was found that the new methodology can reproduce rocket plume flow fields with +/- 0.5% pressure error at ~3% physical scale. The result is a cost-per-test reduction of ~99% compared to the hot-fire subscale testing typically used to obtain equivalent data.

We observed the source in 2020 February and March, finding it in a highly active bursting state. Across a 20 day period, we detected 32 thermonuclear X-ray bursts, with an average burst recurrence time of-+2.0   hr0.30.4. A timing and spectral analysis of the ensemble of X-ray bursts reveals homogeneous burst properties, evidence for short-recurrence time bursts, and the detection of a 386.5 Hz burst oscillation candidate. The latter is especially notable, given that a previous study of this source claimed a 1122 Hz burst oscillation candidate. We did not find any evidence of variability near 1122 Hz and instead find that the 386.5 Hz oscillation is the more prominent signal of the two burst oscillation candidates. Hence, we conclude it is unlikely that XTE J1739–285 has a submillisecond rotation period."

The camera will deliver continuum images and polarization measurements at 50 and 250μm. Currently available detector technologies provide sufficient sensitivity for background limited observations from space, at least on a single pixel basis. FIP incorporates large next-generation superconducting detector arrays and our technology development plan will push the pixel numbers for the arrays to the required size of 8000. Two superconducting detector technologies are currently candidates for the instrument: transition edge sensors or microwave kinetic inductance devices. Using these detectors and taking advantage of the cryogenic telescope that is provided by Origins, FIP will achieve mapping speeds of up to eight orders of magnitude faster than what has been achieved by existing observatories. The science drivers for FIP include observations of solar system objects, dust properties, and magnetic field studies of the nearby interstellar medium, and large scale galaxy surveys to better constrain the star formation history of the universe to address one of the main themes of Origins: “How does the Universe work?” In addition to the science, the FIP instrument plays a critical functional role in aligning the mirrors during on orbit observatory commissioning."

We compare wave properties and occurrence rates at 11 quasi-perpendicular interplanetary shocks with burst data within 10 minutes (~3200 proton gyroradii upstream, ~1900 downstream) of the shock ramp. A perturbed shock is defined as possessing a large amplitude whistler precursor in the quasi-static magnetic field with an amplitude greater than ⅓ the difference between the upstream and downstream average magnetic field magnitudes; laminar shocks lack these large precursors and have a smooth, step function-like  transition.  In  addition  to  wave  modes  previously  observed, including ion acoustic, whistler, and electrostatic solitary waves, waves in the ion acoustic frequency range that show rapid temporal frequency change are common. Three shocks had burst  captures in  the  ramp;  of these, the two laminar shocks with burst data in the ramp contained a wide range of large amplitude wave modes in the ramp whereas the one perturbed shock contained no such waves. Thus, energy dissipation through wave-particle interactions is more prominent in these two laminar shocks than in the perturbed shock. Based on observations from all 11 shocks, the The wave occurrence  rates  for laminar shocks are higher in the transition region, especially the  ramp, than downstream. In  contrast, perturbed shocks  have approximately 2-3 times the wave occurrence rate downstream than laminar shocks."

Although, much research has been conducted on analyzing precipitation patterns and variation at the global scale, trend types have still not received much attention. This study developed a new polynomial‐based model for detecting nonlinear and linear trends in a satellite precipitation product (TRMM 3B43) for the 1998–2017 period at a near‐global scale. We used an automated trend classification method that detects significant trends and classifies them into linear and nonlinear (cubic, quadratic, and concealed) trend types in satellite‐based precipitation at near‐global, continental, and climate zone scales. We found that 12.3% of pixel‐based precipitation time series across the globe have significant trend at 0.05 significance level (50% positive and 50% negative trends). In all continents except Asia, decreasing trends were found to cover larger areas than corresponding increasing trends. Regarding climate zone and precipitation trend change, our results indicate that a linear trend is dominant in the warm temperate (77.7%) and equatorial climates (80.4%) while the least linear change was detected in the polar climate (68.9%). The combined results of continental and climate zone scales indicate significant increasing trends in Asia and arid climate over the last 20 yr. Furthermore, positive trends were found to be more significant at the continental scale, particularly, in Asia relative to the climate zone scale. Linear change in precipitation (80%) was the most dominant trend observed as opposed to nonlinear (quadratic [11%] and cubic [9%]) trend types at the global scale."

For each shock event, we characterize the upstream PUI distribution and derive reduced 1D velocity distributions for the selected upstream and downstream intervals. We also compare the upstream to downstream ratio of spectral indices, computed from the He+ perpendicular distributions, to Mf and 𝜃Bn. We find a positive correlation between this spectral index ratio and Mf, which suggests that perpendicular energization of He+ PUIs is enhanced as the shock becomes stronger. These results inform modeling efforts of PUIs and shock acceleration processes, particularly those taking place at the termination shock."

While their initial performance has been characterized, few studies have examined their long-term degradation. This study focused on the performance of Alphasense low-cost NO2 sensors (NO2-B42F and NO2-B43F) over 4 years (2016–2020). A total of 29 NO2 sensors from 10 batches were collocated 78 times at two sites with reference instruments. Raw signals from “functional” NO2 sensors correlated linearly with reference NO2 concentrations. After long-term deployment, sensor raw signals started to deviate from reference NO2 concentrations due to sensor aging, an accumulated effect after sensor unpacking. Several sensors eventually became “non-functional” as sensor raw signals showed no correlation with reference NO2 concentrations. Sensor aging and non-functionality may be primarily caused by expiration of the ozone (O3) scrubber built into these sensors so that sensors responded to both ambient NO2 and O3. The influence of O3 on sensor response is quantified through the permutation importance method. Most of the sensors are non-functional after approximately 200–400 days of deployment, and no sensor was functional after 400 days of deployment. This result agrees well with the estimated lifetime of the built-in ozone scrubbers considering the ambient ozone concentration in the Pittsburgh area where these sensors were deployed. To ensure reliable data quality in long-term field deployments, we recommend collocating NO2 sensors with reference instruments regularly after 200–400 days of deployment to identify and replace non-functional sensors in a timely manner."

sources for LISA, yet are challenging to simulate realistically as
solving the radiation magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations over the
full dynamic spatio-temporal range of the problem is computationally
infeasible at present. We will provide a brief summary of the the
progress made in the field to understand these systems theoretically
and what new directions groups are pursuing.  We will also report on
our collaboration's progress to simulate these systems using general
relativistic MHD and dynamic GR. In order to cover a larger temporal
range in one set of simulations, we constrain our view to the
circumbinary disk region and measure how the binary mass ratio,
accretion disk size, and black hole spin have on the structure and
variability of the accretion flow. We particularly emphasize how these
parameters influence the overdensity feature, which orbits the binary
near the edge of the cavity, since it is responsible for most of the
electromagnetic emission's variability and variability is a key
signature of a system being a binary.  Extending to smaller length
scales, we will report on simulations following accretion all the down

In this study we focused on methods for deriving the particulate backscattering coefficient at 555 nm, b(bp)(555)/(m). We developed a simple empirical algorithm for deriving b(bp)(555) as a function of a remote sensing reflectance line height (LH) metric. Model training was performed using a high-quality bio-optical dataset that contains coincident in situ measurements of the spectral remote sensing reflectances, R(rs)(λ)/(sr), and the spectral particulate backscattering coefficients, b(bp)(λ). The LH metric used is defined as the magnitude of Rrs(555) relative to a linear baseline drawn between R(rs)(490) and R(rs)(670). Using an independent validation dataset, we compared the skill of the LH-based model with two other models. We used contemporary validation metrics, including bias and mean absolute error (MAE), that were corrected for model and observation uncertainties. The results demonstrated that measurement uncertainties do indeed impact contemporary validation metrics such as mean bias and MAE. Zeta-scores and z-tests for overlapping confidence intervals were also explored as potential methods for assessing model skill."

Unfortunately tensegrity robots can be difficult to make and scale due a fundamental design trade-off:  they need to have enough tension in the structure to maintain its integrity, while not having so much tension that it is difficult to actuate,change  shape  and  move.   This  paper  addresses  this  issue  with  three  approaches:1)  Traction  based  pulley  actuation  that  is  less  sensitive  to  the  tensioning  of  the structure,  2)  A  mix  of  elastic  and  inelastic  cables  allowing  for  a  better  balance between tensioning and actuation and 3) Using flexible rods allowing for actuation with inelastic cables.  We test configurations and show that these approaches can indeed increase the scalability and usefulness of tensegrity robots."

This circular structure is relatively shallow and exhibits a small central uplift, whereas a peak-ring morphology is expected. This discrepancy may be due to long-term and ongoing subglacial erosion but may also be explained by a relatively recent impact through the Greenland Ice Sheet, which is expected to alter the final crater morphology. Here we model crater formation using hydrocode simulations, varying pre-impact ice thickness and impactor composition over crystalline target rock. We find that an ice-sheet thickness of 1.5 or 2 km results in a crater morphology that is consistent with the present morphology of this structure. Further, an
ice sheet that thick substantially inhibits ejection of rocky material, which might explain the absence of rocky ejecta in most existing Greenland deep ice cores if the impact occurred during the late Pleistocene. From the present morphology of the putative Hiawatha impact crater alone,
we cannot distinguish between an older crater formed by a pre-Pleistocene impact into ice-free bedrock or a younger, Pleistocene impact into locally thick ice, but based on our modeling we conclude that latter scenario is possible."
2425,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210015132,2023-08-03,Improved Estimates of Pentad Precipitation through the Merging of Independent Precipitation Datasets,"Three independent, quasi-global, gridded datasets of precipitation (a rain gauge-based dataset, the satellite-only component of the NASA Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement mission [IMERG] Final Run precipitation product, and precipitation estimates derived from NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive [SMAP] soil moisture retrievals), are objectively combined into a single pentad precipitation dataset at 36-km resolution using a unique approach based on extended triple collocation.  The quality of each of the four datasets is then evaluated against independent observations.  When a global land surface model at 36-km resolution is integrated four times, once utilizing the merged precipitation forcing and once with each of the three contributing datasets, the near-surface soil moisture variations produced with the merged forcing validate best against independent satellite-based soil moisture fields.  In addition, the merged dataset is found to be more consistent, relative to each contributor, with estimates of air temperature variations across the globe.  The merged dataset thus appears to draw successfully on the complementary strengths of each contributor:  the particularly high quality of the rain gauge-based dataset in areas of high gauge density, the more uniform accuracy across the globe of the IMERG data, and the moderate accuracy, particularly in semi-arid regions, of the soil moisture retrieval-based data.

Plain Language Summary Obtaining measurements of precipitation across the globe can be challenging.  Rain gauges in some ways provide the most accurate measurements, but gauges are absent in many parts of the world, and even where they exist, they only measure precipitation at the gauge itself and therefore may not provide an accurate large-scale average.  Satellite-based estimates of precipitation largely overcome these problems, but such data have their own issues, notably a “snapshot” (rather than a time-average) character of the measurements and difficulty associated with interpreting the measured radiances in the presence of complex land surfaces.  In the present paper, we use a novel approach to generate a “merged” dataset, one that optimally combines the gauge precipitation information and the satellite-based precipitation information with a third set of estimates derived from soil moisture retrievals.  The merged precipitation dataset and each of the three contributors (aggregated here to 5-day averages at a spatial resolution of about 36-km) are then evaluated for consistency with independent geophysical fields.  The merged dataset is found to perform best, a clear indication that it takes proper advantage of the complementary strengths of each contributor and, accordingly, that the presented approach for merging the different contributors is indeed viable."

While some parameters can be measured relatively easily near the Sun, others are much harder to disentangle from projected coronagraph images. Most predictions have been limited to the arrival time of a CME and include little to no information about the CME's internal properties. ANTEATR-PARADE represents the most thorough description of the interplanetary evolution of CMEs in a highly computationally-efficient model. (Kay & Nieves-Chinchilla, 2020) presents the derivation of this model, where we have added an elliptical cross section to the original arrival time model ANTEATR and introduced internal magnetic forces that, combined with the drag, can alter the shape of the central axis and cross section. ANTEATR-PARADE results include the transit time of CMEs, as well as the shape and size, propagation and expansion velocities, density, and magnetic field properties upon impact. We determine the dependence of each output on each of the ANTEATR-PARADE input parameters. For a fast CME, we see that the transit time and propagation velocity depend most strongly on inputs that modify the drag force whereas the inputs affecting the magnetic forces determine the expansion of the CME. We extend to other CMEs and _nd that the sensitivities change with CME scale. Magnetic forces become more important for an average CME whereas the drag force becomes more important for an extreme CME."

With this reorganization, NASA can begin transforming to 100% direct-to-Earth commercial communications services for missions in the near-Earth region. NASA’s leveraging of commercial direct-to-Earth ground stations offers several benefits for the small satellite community, including lower cost, greater coverage, and increased technology infusion. In the fall of 2020, SCaN announced their intention to rely primarily on industry-provided communications services for missions close to Earth by 2030.   
Commercial services are one way to infuse new technology into the ground station network without requiring an investment from NASA. Digital Video Broadcast, Satellite Second Generation (DVB-S2) is one example of a current technology. When combined with variable coding and modulation (VCM), the system automatically optimizes the data rate based on signal performance, significantly increasing total downlink data volume without an increase in the spacecraft effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). There are several commercial service providers, including Amazon Web Service (AWS) Ground Station (AGS) and the KSATLITE ground stations that support SmallSat missions using DVB-S2 waveforms for downlinks. This paper identifies some commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) CubeSat/SmallSat DVB-S2 X-band and Ka-band radios. Overall, NASA’s increased dependence on commercial direct-to-Earth ground stations is a significant benefit for the small satellite community."

Most of the data pertain to three nozzles of aspect ratios (AR) 2, 4 and 8, each having an equivalent diameter of 2.12 in. The trapped waves, manifesting as a series of peaks in the near field pressure fluctuation spectra, are seen with all three nozzles. The number of spectral peaks detected on the major axis is larger than that detected on the minor axis by a factor approximately equal to the AR. These spectral peaks occur in high subsonic conditions and persist into the supersonic regime. Screech tones seem to appear as a continuation of these spectral peaks, i.e., with increasing Mach number it is as if one of these peaks gets amplified and turns into the screech tone. This trend is clearer at smaller AR and gets somewhat obscured at higher AR. Screech frequency variation with Mach number is documented for these and other rectangular nozzles, covering an AR range of 1-16. For larger AR (≥ 3), screech frequency is found to scale on the narrow dimension of the nozzle. Screech staging behavior is more pronounced for smaller AR cases. The screech frequency data for the AR=1 (square) case involves multiple stages similar to that of a round nozzle."

The PIP together with a vertically pointing radar, a weighing bucket gauge, and a laser-optical disdrometer was deployed at the NWS Marquette, Michigan office building for a long-term field study supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Global Precipitation Measurement mission Ground Validation program.   The site was also equipped with a weather station.  During the 2017-18 winter, PIP functioned nearly uninterrupted at frigid temperatures accumulating 2345.8 mm of geometric snow depth over a total of  499 hours.  This long record consists of 30 events, and the PIP-retrieved and snow stake field measured SWE differed less than 15% in every event.  For the windy events, the wind corrected stake field record agreed better with the PIP-retrieved SWE.  Two of the major events with the longest duration and the highest accumulation are examined in detail.

Borescope evaluations after these flights indicated accelerated damage had occurred over this flight series to the blades in the high pressure compressor section of all four CFM56-2C1 turbine engines. This erosion and impact damage appeared to vary in severity, and appeared most severe for engines 3 and 4 located on the right wing of the DC-8.Engine 3 had the most flight hours and cycles since last overhaul of 7,152 h and 2,502 cycles. Engine 4 had the lowest flight hours and cycles since last overhaul of 1,354 h and 369 cycles. For these reasons, three noticeably damaged blades were selected from the high pressure compressor for each of these two engines, and then evaluated at NASA GRC using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Engine 3 compressor blades had both erosion and impact damage that were observed and characterized. The erosion damage was associated with embedded particles 13 μm to 42 μm in sectioned width, composed of varied compositions ranging from SiO2 to SiO2 also containing Ca, Mg, and Al (CMAS). The impact damage was associated with the impacts of larger objects at least 650 μm to 850 μm in width, but only small fragments 5 μm to 15 μm in sectioned width were embedded in the impact surface, also composed of SiO2 to SiO2 containing Ca, Mg, and Al (CMAS). On the other hand, engine 4 blades had only impact damage that was observed and characterized. This impact damage was associated with impacts of objects at least 1,480 μm to 2,080μm in width. Small fragments 5 μm to 15 μm in sectioned width were embedded in the impact surface. For one impact, the fragments were again composed of SiO2 to SiO2 containing Ca, Mg, and Al (CMAS). For two other impacts, the fragments were often composed of Fe, and less frequently Cu."

and habitability. Combining radial velocity (RV) and transit data provides additional information
on exoplanet physical properties. We detect a transiting rocky planet with an orbital period
of 1.467 days around the nearby red dwarf star Gliese 486. The planet Gliese 486 b is
2.81 Earth masses and 1.31 Earth radii, with uncertainties of 5%, as determined from RV data
and photometric light curves. The host star is at a distance of ~8.1 parsecs, has a J-band magnitude of ~7.2, and is observable from both hemispheres of Earth. On the basis of these properties and the planet’s short orbital period and high equilibrium temperature, we show that this terrestrial planet is suitable for emission and transit spectroscopy."

Strategic thinking and leading change concepts were used to analyze reports and presentations on global trends and visionary thinking about the future of systems and digital engineering. The context, strategic time horizon, stakeholders, strategic challenges, strategic advantages, driving forces, and  opportunities were considered. The analysis resulted in a future vision of MBSE that shows what NASA systems engineers and digital machines will do to perform rapid, extraordinary, and unprecedented missions. The NASA systems engineer, in this future vision, works with a global project team in a virtual and collaborative environment, engineers the system, and uses digital approaches as the routine and default way of working. The digital machines provide data-driven and automated mission designs; have a backbone of program and project management, systems engineering, and product life-cycle management; and are a knowledge-sharing infrastructure. The NASA systems engineer and the systems engineering team are envisioned to use digital machines to plan and perform rapid exploration missions, develop a digital twin that lasts across the life cycle, and develop enduring and adaptable systems. NASA has an engineering enterprise and a life-cycle management framework that endure, adapt, and respond.

Eruption and Early Evolution,"We present observations and modeling of the magnetic field configuration, morphology, and dynamics of a large-scale, high-latitude filament eruption observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We
analyze the 2015 July 9–10 filament eruption and the evolution of the resulting coronal mass ejection (CME) through the solar corona. The slow streamer-blowout CME leaves behind an elongated
post-eruption arcade above the extended polarity inversion line that is only poorly visible in extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) disk observations and does not resemble a typical bright flare-loop system. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation results from our data-inspired modeling of this eruption compare
favorably with the EUV and white-light coronagraph observations. We estimate the reconnection flux
from the simulation’s flare-arcade growth and examine the magnetic-field orientation and evolution of
the erupting prominence, highlighting the transition from an erupting sheared-arcade filament channel into a streamer-blowout flux-rope CME. Our results represent the first numerical modeling of a
global-scale filament eruption where multiple ambiguous and complex observational signatures in EUV
and white light can be fully understood and explained with the MHD simulation. In this context, our
findings also suggest that the so-called “stealth CME” classification, as a driver of unexpected or
“problem” geomagnetic storms, belongs more to a continuum of observable/non-observable signatures
than to separate or distinct eruption processes."

Despite this, many challenges exist when developing, communicating, and incorporating climate risk information. There are limited resources on how stakeholders perceive risks, use risk information, and what barriers exist to limit knowledge integration. This paper seeks to define the following: 1) What do conservation stakeholders consider to be the most significant climate risks they face now and possibly in the future? 2) What have been the most significant barriers to their using climate risk information? 3) What sources and types of knowledge would be most useful for these managers to overcome these barriers? A survey was conducted among stakeholders (n = 224) associated with World Wildlife Fund projects in tropical and subtropical countries. A very high proportion of stakeholders used climate risk information and yet faced integration-related challenges, which included too much uncertainty and the lack of a relevant scale for planning. The main factors preventing the use of climate risk information in decision-making were unavailability of climate risk information, no or limited financial or human resources available to respond, lack of organizational mandate or support, and no or limited institutional incentives. Comparing perceived current and future risks revealed a decline in concern for some future climate hazards. Survey respondents identified scientific reports, climate scientists, and online sources as the most useful information sources of climate risk information, while (i) maps and illustrations; (ii) scenarios format; and (iii) data tables, graphs, and charts were identified as user-friendly formats."

They cover polar, mid latitude and tropical oceanic regions and represent a first effort to use MAN observations for such evaluation. The global reanalysis model products evaluated in this study are from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2), the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA I), and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) model. The satellite products evaluated are from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER), the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME-2), the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY), and the Atmospheric Infra-red Sounder (AIRS). Satellite retrievals of W are based on the attenuation of solar reflected light by water vapor absorption bands, except those from AIRS that rely on brightness temperature measurements. A very good agreement is observed between the model estimates and MAN, with mean differences of ~5% and standard deviations of ~15%. These results are within the uncertainties associated with the models and the measurements, indicating the skill of the reanalysis models to estimate W over oceans under clear sky conditions. Mean differences of W between the satellite and MAN products are ~11, 6.7, 12, −7, and 3% for MODIS, POLDER, GOME-2, SCIAMACHY and AIRS respectively, while their standard deviations are 31, 29, 28, 20 and 17%. These differences reveal the need to address inconsistencies among different satellite sensors and ground-based measurements to reduce the uncertainties associated with the retrievals."

Changes in the climate have raised concerns from local farmers about altered growing seasons. In response, the DEVELOP team assessed annual vegetation phenology trends across Bhutan from 1981-2014 by comparing vegetation phenology-derived data and meteorological data. The project assessed phenology change using Vegetation Index and Phenology (VIP) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. We also used Climate Hazards Center Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) precipitation data and Famine Early Warning System Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) temperature data to assess climate trends in the country. The team assessed VIP phenology data for 1981-2014 to assess trends for the start of season, day of peak, and length of season. For the main growing season, the results indicated that the start of season and day of peak were delayed, while the length of season increased by 22 days. Analysis of temperature and precipitation data for the early 1980s to present indicted that Bhutan’s temperature has become warmer and precipitation has increased. Satellite-based precipitation and temperature data were compared to in situ precipitation and temperature data, yielding high correlations for both precipitation (R=0.85) and temperature (R=0.9). The project results and methods were shared with the Ugyen Wangchuck Institute for Conservation and Environmental Research (UWICER) to help assess climate change impacts in Bhutan."

We analyze 2005–2015 tropospheric column concentrations of two trace gases that serve as proxies for surface ozone precursors retrieved from the OMI/Aura satellite: Nitrogen dioxide (ΩNO2; NOx proxy) and formaldehyde (ΩHCHO; VOC proxy). We find 3.5% and 7.7% summer drought enhancements (classified by SPEI) for ΩNO2 and ΩHCHO, respectively, corroborating signals previously extracted from ground‐level observations. When we subset by land cover type, the strongest ΩHCHO drought enhancement (10%) occurs in the woody savannas of the Southeast US. By isolating the influences of precipitation and temperature, we infer that enhanced biogenic VOC emissions in this region increase ΩHCHO independently with both high temperature and low precipitation during drought. The strongest ΩNO2 drought enhancement (6.0%) occurs over Midwest US croplands and grasslands, which we infer to reflect the sensitivity of soil NOx emissions to temperature."

The storm reached a zonal size of 4,500 km and developed a tail extending zonally 33,000 km. Two new short-lived storms erupted in May in the hexagon edge. These storms formed after the convective storms that took place in 2018 in nearby latitudes. There were no noticeable changes in the zonal profile of Saturn's polar winds in 2018-2020. Measurements of the longitude position of the vertices of the hexagon throughout this period yield a value for its period of rotation equal to that of System III of radio-rotation measured at the time of Voyagers. We report changes in the hexagon clouds related to the activity of the storms. Our study reinforces the idea that Saturn’s hexagon is a well rooted structure with a possible direct relationship with the bulk rotation of the planet."

This spanload is the minimum induced drag of a wing for a given structural weight with properties that eliminate adverse yaw. Aircraft using the Prandtl bell spanload were flown and investigated. The results of this research show that many previously held assumptions should be rethought, and the creation of aircraft using the Prandtl bell spanload will require considerable new techniques.
Part of this work centered on the use of inverse methods. The usual first-step approach to a computational fluids problem is to create a geometry of the aircraft. Once this geometry exists, the computational fluids solution has been solved; however, the problem of creating the geometry still exists. A very small segment of the computational fluids world has concentrated on inverse solutions. This design approach begins with an end result - the computational fluids solution; from this end result, the geometry is sought.
A more generic inverse tool was desired that would allow for the design of wings - specifically Prandtl bell spanload wings. Such a tool has been developed and allows for variable taper, aspect ratio, sweep, airfoils, and design-lift coefficients; output from the tool results in twist distribution of wings."

The Marine Life Protection Act aims to protect these ecosystems by establishing a network of marine protected areas (MPAs), in part by requiring regulatory agencies to monitor estuary extent and health. However, California has 23 estuarine MPAs (EMPAs) and approximately 440,000 total acres of estuarine habitat and, therefore, ground-based data collection can be time and resource intensive. This project used remotely sensed data to examine the health of California EMPAs in an effort to supplement ground-based field measurements. Specifically using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-SAR), this project assessed mouth state, inundation extent, turbidity, Chlorophyll-a, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) for estuaries observable with these sensors. The Normalized Water Difference Index (NDWI) from Sentinel-2 MSI was capable of capturing estuary mouth state and inundation extent. Meanwhile, Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI indicated a capacity to capture differences in water quality metrics coinciding with changes to estuary mouth state using algorithms applied in Google Earth Engine (GEE).

Specifically, the aviation industry has set goals to   reduce greenhouse   gas   emissions, providing   a   sustainable transportation mechanism with minimal impacts on the environment. This reduction must be accomplished through several means, including advanced technology, sustainable propulsion, efficient air traffic management, and improved operations. A potential solution for improving operations in an efficient air traffic management system is the Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) concept. The TASAR concept applies onboard automation for the purpose of advising the pilot of route modifications that would be beneficial to the flight, leading to a decrease in direct operating costs through fuel burn reduction and shorter flight times. This report discusses analyses that provide an estimate of the potential environmental benefits that result from the application of the TASAR concept.

Motivated by this, we report on a search for a 3.5 keV emission line from the Milky Way's galactic dark matter halo with HaloSat. As a single pixel, collimated instrument, HaloSat observations are impervious to potential systematic effects due to grazing incidence reflection and CCD pixelization, and thus may offer a check on possible instrumental systematic errors in previous analyses. We report nondetections of a ~3.5 keV emission line in four HaloSat observations near the Galactic center. In the context of the sterile neutrino decay interpretation of the putative line feature, we provide 90% confidence level upper limits on the 3.5 keV line flux for a field centered 18.6 degrees from the Galactic center and the corresponding 7.1 keV sterile neutrino mixing angle: F ≤ 0.077 ph/((sq. cm)(s)(sr)) and sin^2(2θ) ≤ 4.25 x 10^(-11). The HaloSat mixing angle upper limit was calculated using a modern parameterization of the Milky Way's dark matter distribution, and in order to compare with previous limits, we also report the limit calculated using a common historical model. The HaloSat mixing angle upper limit places constraints on a number of previous mixing angle estimates derived from observations of the Milky Way's dark matter halo and galaxy clusters, and excludes several previous detections of the line. The upper limits cannot, however, entirely rule out the sterile neutrino decay interpretation of the 3.5 keV line feature."

The target was observed in Sectors 4 and 5 during Cycle 1, with light curves extracted from TESS Full Frame Image data. It was also previously observed by the WASP survey and ASAS-SN. The system consists of three gravitationally bound eclipsing binaries in a hierarchical structure of an inner quadruple system with an outer binary subsystem. Follow up
observations from several different observatories were conducted as a means of determining additional parameters. The system was resolved by speckle interferometry with a 0 42 separation between the inner quadruple and outer binary, inferring an estimated outer period of ∼2 kyr. It was determined that the fainter of the two resolved components is an 8.217 day eclipsing binary, which orbits the inner quadruple that contains two eclipsing binaries with periods of 1.570 days and 1.306 days. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of the stellar parameters has shown that the three binaries of TIC 168789840 are “triplets,” as each binary is quite similar to the others in terms of mass, radius, and Teff. As a consequence of its rare composition, structure, and orientation, this object can provide important new insight into the formation, dynamics, and evolution of multiple star systems. Future observations could reveal if the intermediate and outer orbital planes are all aligned with the planes of the three inner eclipsing binaries."

Shortly before merger, the inner portions of this circumbinary disk are subject to general relativistic effects. To study this regime, we approximate the spacetime metric of close orbiting black holes by superimposing two boosted Kerr–Schild terms. After demonstrating the quality of this approximation, we carry out very long-term general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the circumbinary disk. We consider black holes with spin dimensionless parameters of magnitude 0.9, in one simulation parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the binary, but in another anti-parallel. These are contrasted with spinless simulations. We find that, for a fixed surface mass density in the inner circumbinary disk, aligned spins of this magnitude approximately reduce the mass accretion rate by 14% and counter-aligned spins increase it by 45%, leaving many other disk properties unchanged."

Although expansion of global carbon dioxide (CO2) observatories makes it possible to estimate C-cycle processes from ecosystem to global scales, these estimates do not necessarily agree. At the continental US scale, only 5% of C fixed through photosynthesis remains as net ecosystem exchange (NEE), but ecosystem measurements indicate that only 2% of fixed C remains in grasslands, whereas as much as 30% remains in needleleaf forests. The wet and warm Southeast has the highest gross primary productivity and the relatively wet and cool Midwest has the highest NEE, indicating important spatial mismatches.

The ocean tide is one of the most critical corrections due to the amplitude of the tidal elevations and to the aliasing phenomena of high-frequency signals into the lower-frequency band, but the internal-tide signatures at the ocean surface are not yet corrected globally.

Internal tides can have a signature of several centimeters at the surface with wavelengths of about 50–250 km for the first mode and even smaller scales for higher-order modes. The goals of the upcoming Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission and other high-resolution ocean measurements make the correction of these small-scale signals a challenge, as the correction of all tidal variability becomes mandatory to access accurate measurements of other oceanic signals.

In this context, several scientific teams are working on the development of new internal-tide models, taking advantage of the very long altimeter time series now available, which represent an unprecedented and valuable global ocean database. The internal-tide models presented here focus on the coherent internal-tide signal and they are of three types: empirical models based upon analysis of existing altimeter missions, an assimilative model and a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model.

A detailed comparison and validation of these internal-tide models is proposed using existing satellite altimeter databases. The analysis focuses on the four main tidal constituents: M2, K1, O1 and S2. The validation process is based on a statistical analysis of multi-mission altimetry including Jason-2 and Cryosphere Satellite-2 data. The results show a significant altimeter variance reduction when using internal-tide corrections in all ocean regions where internal tides are generating or propagating. A complementary spectral analysis also gives some estimation of the performance of each model as a function of wavelength and some insight into the residual non-stationary part of internal tides in the different regions of interest. This work led to the implementation of a new internal-tide correction (ZARON'one) in the next geophysical data records version-F (GDR-F) standards."

However, canopy SIF and RS observations are impacted by topography, vegetation three dimension (3D) structure, leaf orientation, non foliar elements (e.g., tree woody skeleton), ... Physically based downscaling of canopy SIF RS data to leaf-level (i.e., to leaf photosynthesis) requires 3D radiative transfer (RT) models simulating canopy SIF and its observation. These models are necessary to better exploit the potential of SIF, by linking leaf SIF and SIF in RS observations as a function of canopy 3D architecture and experimental configurations (sun and viewing directions, etc.). The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is a comprehensive 3D radiative transfer (RT) model for urban and natural landscapes. This paper presents its SIF modeling for vegetation simulated with facets, its validation with the SCOPE/mSCOPE 1D models, and its recent extension to SIF modelling for landscapes simulated with 3D turbid medium."

This problem hinders accounting for the potentially large impact of regional differences in dust properties on clouds, the Earth's energy balance, and terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles. Here, we constrain the contribution of each of the world's main dust source regions to the global dust cycle. We use an analytical framework that integrates an ensemble of global aerosol model simulations with observationally informed constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD). We obtain a dataset that constrains the relative contribution of nine major source regions to size-resolved dust emission, atmospheric loading, DAOD, concentration, and deposition flux. We find that the 22–29 Tg (1 standard error range) global loading of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 µm is partitioned as follows: North African source regions contribute ∼ 50 % (11–15 Tg), Asian source regions contribute ∼ 40 % (8–13 Tg), and North American and Southern Hemisphere regions contribute ∼ 10 % (1.8–3.2 Tg). These results suggest that current models on average overestimate the contribution of North African sources to atmospheric dust loading at ∼ 65 %, while underestimating the contribution of Asian dust at ∼ 30 %. Our results further show that each source region's dust loading peaks in local spring and summer, which is partially driven by increased dust lifetime in those seasons. We also quantify the dust deposition flux to the Amazon rainforest to be ∼ 10 Tg yr−1, which is a factor of 2–3 less than inferred from satellite data by previous work that likely overestimated dust deposition by underestimating the dust mass extinction efficiency. The data obtained in this paper can be used to obtain improved constraints on dust impacts on clouds, climate, biogeochemical cycles, and other parts of the Earth system."

These model errors are partially caused by fundamental difficulties in simulating dust emission in coarse-resolution models and in accurately representing dust microphysical properties. Here we mitigate these problems by developing a new methodology that yields an improved representation of the global dust cycle. We present an analytical framework that uses inverse modeling to integrate an ensemble of global model simulations with observational constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth. We then compare the inverse model results against independent measurements of dust surface concentration and deposition flux and find that errors are reduced by approximately a factor of 2 relative to current model simulations of the Northern Hemisphere dust cycle. The inverse model results show smaller improvements in the less dusty Southern Hemisphere, most likely because both the model simulations and the observational constraints used in the inverse model are less accurate. On a global basis, we find that the emission flux of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 µm (PM20) is approximately 5000 Tg yr−1, which is greater than most models account for. This larger PM20 dust flux is needed to match observational constraints showing a large atmospheric loading of coarse dust. We obtain gridded datasets of dust emission, vertically integrated loading, dust aerosol optical depth, (surface) concentration, and wet and dry deposition fluxes that are resolved by season and particle size. As our results indicate that this dataset is more accurate than current model simulations and the MERRA-2 dust reanalysis product, it can be used to improve quantifications of dust impacts on the Earth system."

Significant crosstalk effect has also been found and characterized in TEBs of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP). NOAA-20 VIIRS, a follow-on instrument to SNPP VIIRS, was launched on November 18, 2017.

In this study, we propose a novel semi-analytical method for estimating TSS in clear to extremely turbid waters from remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs). The proposed method includes three sub-algorithms used sequentially. First, the remotely sensed waters are classified into clear (Type I), moderately turbid (Type II), highly turbid (Type III), and extremely turbid (Type IV) water types by comparing the values of Rrs at 490, 560, 620, and 754 nm. Second, semi-analytical models specific to each water type are used to determine the particulate backscattering coefficients (bbp) at a corresponding single wavelength (i.e., 560 nm for Type I, 665 nm for Type II, 754 nm for Type III, and 865 nm for Type IV). Third, a specific relationship between TSS and bbp at the corresponding wavelength is used in each water type. Unlike other existing approaches, this method is strictly semi-analytical and its sub-algorithms were developed using synthetic datasets only. The performance of the proposed method was compared to that of three other state-of-the-art methods using simulated (N = 1000, TSS ranging from 0.01 to 1100 g/m3) and in situ measured (N = 3421, TSS ranging from 0.09 to 2627 g/m3) pairs of Rrs and TSS. Results showed a significant improvement with a Median Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 16.0% versus 30.2–90.3% for simulated data and 39.7% versus 45.9–58.1% for in situ data, respectively. The new method was subsequently applied to 175 MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and 498 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images acquired in the 2003–2020 timeframe to produce long-term TSS time-series for Lake Suwa and Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. Performance assessments using MERIS and OLCI matchups showed good agreements with in situ TSS measurements."

The other edition comes from the 1-degree daily aggregation provided by standard MODIS Level-3 data, as in previous versions of the MODIS CRs, for easier use with datasets mapped on equal angle grids. Both editions consist of 11 clusters whose centroids are nearly identical.We provide a physical interpretation of the new CRs and aspects of their climatology that have not been previously examined, such as seasonal and interannual variability of CR frequency of occurrence.

The first step of our analysis compares the retrieved aerosol and cloud properties against equivalent products from the MODIS MOD06ACAERO retrieval (Meyer et al., 2015). While the correlation between the two satellite retrievals of the above-cloud aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is good (R = 0.78), the AOT retrieved by SEVIRI is 20.3 % smaller than that obtained from the MODIS retrieval. This difference in AOT is attributed mainly to the more absorbing aerosol model assumed for the SEVIRI retrieval compared to MODIS. The underlying cloud optical thickness (COT) derived from the two satellites is in good agreement (R = 0.90). The cloud droplet effective radius (CER) retrieved by SEVIRI is consistently smaller than MODIS by 2.2 µm, which is mainly caused by the use of different spectral bands of the satellite instruments. In the second part of our analysis, we compare the forecast water vapour profiles used for the SEVIRI atmospheric correction as well as the aforementioned aerosol and cloud products with in situ measurements made from the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) aircraft platform during the CLARIFY-2017 campaign. Around Ascension Island, the column water vapour used to correct the SEVIRI signal is overestimated by 3.1 mm in the forecast compared to that measured by dropsondes. However, the evidence suggests that the accuracy of the atmospheric correction improves closer to the African coast. Consistency is observed between the SEVIRI above-cloud AOT and in situ measurements (from cavity ring-down spectroscopy instruments) when the measured single-scattering albedo is close to that assumed in the retrieval algorithm. On the other hand, the satellite retrieval overestimates the AOT when the assumed aerosol model is not absorbing enough. Consistency is also found between the cloud properties retrieved by SEVIRI and the CER measured by a cloud droplet probe and the liquid water path derived from a microwave radiometer. Despite the instrumental limitations of the geostationary satellite, the consistency obtained between SEVIRI, MODIS and the aircraft measurements demonstrates the ability of the retrieval in providing additional information on the temporal evolution of the aerosol properties above clouds."

A theoretical and numerical investigation is performed to characterize the effects of nose bluntness on disturbance amplification over the circular cone for several angles of attack, with the goal of understanding the potential physical mechanisms behind the experimental observations. The three-dimensional laminar basic states over a 1.5 m long, 7-degree half-angle cone with 9.525 mm nosetip radius are computed for selected angles of attack values and freestream conditions that are selected to match the Mach 10 experiments conducted within the Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel 9 at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC). The solutions at a freestream unit Reynolds number of 17.1 million per meter are used to perform detailed instability analyses for angles of attack equal to 0, 1, 3, and 5 degrees. Results indicate that the linear amplification of stationary crossflow waves along inflection lines may begin to influence transition along the acreage of the cone for angles of attack equal to or larger than 5 degrees. The measured trend in transition front with respect to increasing angle of attack is found to be consistent with the predicted increase in the amplification factors for Mack mode disturbances along the streamline trajectories. The increase in Mack mode amplification along the windward ray for higher angles of attack is shown to be the result of a progressively earlier entropy-layer swallowing. Computations also indicate that the transition amplification factor along the windward ray is not constant and increases with the angle of attack and that the transition #-factors along the leeward ray are rather small. The nonmodal analysis for zero degrees angle of attack shows that entropy-layer disturbances with appreciably strong energy growth can coexist with Mack mode instabilities at the measured transition location."

The presence of the transient electromagnetic counterpart of the binary neutron star GW170817 led to the first standard-siren measurement of H(0). Here we additionally use binary black hole detections in conjunction with galaxy catalogs and report a joint measurement. Our updated measurement is H(0) = 69(+16,-8) km/s Mpc (68.3% of the highest density posterior interval with a flat-in-log prior) which is an improvement by a factor of 1.04 (about 4%) over the GW170817-only value of 6(+17,-8) km/s Mpc. A significant additional contribution currently comes from GW170814, a loud and well-localized detection from a part of the sky thoroughly covered by the Dark Energy Survey. With numerous detections anticipated over the upcoming years, an exhaustive understanding of other systematic effects are also going to become increasingly important. These results establish the path to cosmology using gravitational-wave observations with and without transient electromagnetic counterparts."

Here we assess the potential of MIRI photometry to constrain galaxyproperties in the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science(CEERS)survey. We derive estimated MIRIfluxes fromthe spectral energy distributions(SEDs)of real sources that fall in a planned MIRI pointing. We also obtain MIRIfluxes for hypothetical active galactic nucleus(AGN)–galaxy mixed models varying the AGN fractionalcontribution to the total IR luminosity(fracAGN). Based on these modelfluxes, we simulate CEERS imaging(3.6 hrexposure)in six bands from F770W to F2100W usingMIRISIMand reduce these data usingJWST PIPELINE.Weperform point-spread-function-matched photometry withTPHOTandfit the source SEDs withX-CIGALE,simultaneously modeling photometric redshift and other physical properties. Adding the MIRI data, the accuracyof both redshift and fracAGNis generally improved by factors of2 for all sources atz3. Notably, for pure-galaxy inputs(fracAGN=0), the accuracy of fracAGNis improved by∼100 times thanks to MIRI. The simulatedCEERS MIRI data are slightly more sensitive to AGN detections than the deepest X-ray survey, based on theempiricalLX–L6μmrelation. Like X-ray observations, MIRI can also be used to constrain the AGN accretionpower(accuracy≈0.3 dex). Our work demonstrates that MIRI will be able to place strong constraints on the mid-IR luminosities from star formation and AGNs and thereby facilitate studies of the galaxy/AGN coevolution."

Prior studies compared the relative safety of NASA concept vehicles, Figure ES1, designed for UAM and provided recommendations for industry research, aircraft architectural improvements, and regulatory updates. After the prior study completed, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) released regulatory guidance in the form of a special condition (SC), SC-VTOL-01, for multirotors with distributed propulsion and flight controls (DPFC).
The objective of the current work was to develop DPFC architectures that will comply with SC-VTOL-01. Vehicle designs, DPFC architectures, and stability & control (S&C) models were developed to find limitations and trends to guide industry. To guide this task, NASA developed quad, hex, and an octorotor to better define vehicle attributes and trade space. Aircraft for study included electric, hybrid-electric, and turboshaft powerplants and collective and RPM control schemes. Assessments are in terms of the safety level achieved, and/or aircraft component/features needed to meet SC-VTOL-01. The most challenging criteria being the catastrophic failure rate, ≤10-9 catastrophic failures per flight hour, and that no single failures may result in a catastrophic event.
A disciplined process was followed, similar to that in Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) 4761. A preliminary system safety assessment (PSSA) leveraged prior work as a basis of creating failure rate budgets for system design teams. System designs were updated and iterated upon, working with reliability and safety subject matter experts to develop SC-VTOL-01 compliant designs. Design changes were reflected in updated PSSAs for initial verification of compliance.
The DPFC architecture was broken into four system design teams, the (1) flight control system (FCS), (2) drive and power system, (3) thermal management system (TMS), and (4) electrical power and distribution system. The FCS including elements necessary to control the aircraft, drive and power including elements necessary to generate and transmit shaft power, the TMS including elements necessary to maintain temperature limits in all operating environments, and electrical pow-er and distribution including equipment necessary to store and transmit electrical energy.
Results found that all aircraft evaluated may have paths to comply with SC-VTOL-01, Figure ES2. However, S&C models showed large power transients that must be addressed and PSSA results show that future work is needed in single load path structures, high voltage power storage and distribution, and in motor/rotor overspeed protection."

With these new country-level components in place, and by adding global and regional estimates of energy use in food supply chains, we estimate that total GHG emissions from the food system were about 16 CO2eq yr−1 in 2018, or one-third of the global anthropogenic total. Three quarters of these emissions, 13 Gt CO2eq yr−1, were generated either within the farm gate or in pre- and post-production activities, such as manufacturing, transport, processing, and waste disposal. The remainder was generated through land use change at the conversion boundaries of natural ecosystems to agricultural land. Results further indicate that pre- and post-production emissions were proportionally more important in developed than in developing countries, and that during 1990–2018, land use change emissions decreased while pre- and post-production emissions increased. We also report results on a per capita basis, showing world total food systems per capita emissions decreasing during 1990–2018 from 2.9 to 2.2 t CO2eq cap−1, with per capita emissions in developed countries about twice those in developing countries in 2018. Our findings also highlight that conventional IPCC categories, used by countries to report emissions in the National GHG inventory, systematically underestimate the contribution of the food system to total anthropogenic emissions. We provide a comparative mapping of food system categories and activities in order to better quantify food-related emissions in national reporting and identify mitigation opportunities across the entire food system."

We find that the ZTF sample of TDE hosts is dominated by compact “green valley” galaxies. After we restrict the comparison sample to galaxies with a similar concentration, as measured by the Sérsic index, we find this green valley overrepresentation is even larger. That is, concentrated red sequence galaxies are not producing TDEs at elevated levels. We present host galaxy spectra that show that E+A galaxies are overrepresented in the ZTF sample by a factor of≈22, which is lower than previous TDE host galaxy studies have found. We find that this overrepresentation can be fully accounted for when taking into account the masses, colors, and Sérsic indices of the ZTF TDE hosts. The combination of both green colors and high Sérsic index of the typical TDE host galaxy could be explained if the TDE rate is temporarily enhanced following a merger that leads to a higher central concentration of stars."

This document addresses a need within the research community for a consistent means of documenting recordings of the ambient soundscape via a metadata framework (Rizzi, et al. 2020). Such recordings can provide a cognitive context for AAM vehicle sounds, as well as a fixed condition or independent variable against which experimental manipulations of vehicle sounds can be evaluated in listening tests. This document also provides recommendations for recording and reproduction techniques of ambient sound. A brief review is made of the use of ambient recordings in prior aircraft noise studies, and of psychoacoustic motivations for its implementation is reviewed from the fields of soundscape, auditory scene analysis, and time-varying partial specific loudness research."

The present paper is related to the NASA-led roughness experiment on the secondary side of the BOLT-II configuration. First, computations are performed to aid mean-flow based correlations for the transition measurements acquired during an experimental campaign in the Ludwieg Tube facility at the United States Air Force Academy. To that end, both laminar and turbulent flow computations are performed for selected conditions of the experiment with a 1:3 scale model of the slightly shorter BOLT configuration. The variation in well-known correlation parameters for transition due to isolated roughness elements with respect to element position, height, and flow Reynolds number is delineated. Furthermore, the wake instability theory is used to examine the amplification of unstable disturbances behind the centerline trip at the design conditions of the BOLT-II flight experiment and for its dynamically scaled version on the 1:3 scale model of the wind tunnel experiment. To our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of the wake instabilities in the presence of a prominent entropy layer outside the boundary layer. At the nominal flight design condition of Re<sub>∞</sub>) = 5.44 and Re<sub>∞</sub> = 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup>/m, a diamond planform (“pizza-box”) trip with k/δ = 0.70 and planform-halfwidth-to-height ratio of b/k = 3.0 at X/L = 0.254 induces a strong distortion of the boundary-layer flow in the vicinity of the symmetry plane, such that the wake structure includes a centerline streak produced by the flow retardation behind the trip along with multiple additional, prominent vorticity structures representing the necklace vortex system. Stability results reveal that each of these streaks can support a strong amplification of wake instabilities within a frequency band of 95 kHz–255 kHz, with a peak N-factor of greater than 15 beyond X/L ≈ 0.42. The dynamically scaled wind tunnel configuration with Re<sub>∞</sub> = 20.25 x 10<sup>6</sup>/m is also found to support N > 15 at similar axial stations."

In this paper we propose a novel recursive multi-step machine learning (ML) approach to predict airport configuration. The multi-step approach guarantees stability of the predicted configuration by taking as input the configuration predicted at the previous time step. The features of the proposed model include weather data, future arrival and departure counts and current configuration.

This work extends our prior research on developing an impedance-based complexity metric for unmanned aircraft system traffic scenario classification. Impedance-based metric was evaluated for 1045 randomly generated scenarios. Scenarios with overall impedance above a certain threshold were declared as not feasible. A ground-delay-based approach was developed to be applied to the rest of the scenarios so as to remediate any scenarios with small areas of high impedance on their impedance maps. A sample application is shown for a scenario with sixty flights. The detailed trade-offs between overall accrued system delay, the number of delayed flights, the total number of conflicts and the highest impedance observed as a function of the delay tolerance for each aircraft are provided. Potential applications to Urban Air Mobility traffic scenarios are also discussed."

The first step predicts a landing time by using mediation rules to select from among physics-based predictions (relying on the expected flight trajectory) already available in real time in the Federal Aviation Administration System Wide Information Management system data feeds. The second step uses a machine learning model built upon the mediated predictions. The model is trained to predict the error in the mediated prediction, using features describing the current state of an airborne flight. These features are calculated in real time from a relatively small number of data elements that are readily available for airborne flights. Initial results based on five months of data at six large airports demonstrate that incorporating a machine learning model on top of the mediated physics-based prediction can lead to substantial additional improvements in prediction quality."

A federated scheduling algorithm is first developed, together with data that needs to be shared among schedulers. Two mechanisms for coordinating scheduling and conflict resolution functions are then introduced and studied as conflicts in high-density operations may not be completely resolved by conflict resolution function alone. The first coordination mechanism is constructed based on the arrival scheduler at the destination and another one utilizes the departure scheduler at the origin. Experiments and trade space studies are conducted to compare these two mechanisms using fast-time traffic simulations. Results show that both mechanisms perform well in coordinating scheduling and conflict resolution functions and helping resolve all potential conflicts. Experiments also show that with proper parameter selection, both mechanisms can achieve better efficiency (less delay) while maintaining zero losses of separation."

To ensure that this type of autonomy is feasible, one of the critical steps from a safety and efficiency perspective is understanding various factors that affect the spatial separation between airborne flights and ensure that these factors can be managed. In terms of separation assurance and scheduling, an important real-world concern is that future states of aircraft cannot be perfectly predicted.  The focus of this research paper is to understand how these prediction errors affect separation and scheduling services and to explore mitigation strategies to handle these errors. 

In this research, we have simulated these types of uncertainty by adding wind-prediction errors to trajectory predictions for separation.  With these wind-prediction errors, we decompose the problem into two separate questions. First, using both simulation and analytical methods, we look at conflict-detection-only scenarios to understand how the wind errors affect required minimum temporal separation between crossing flights to ensure a specific spatial separation. Next, we study how trajectory errors effect conflict resolution, and we explore different combinations of scheduling and separation assurance to mitigate the effects of uncertainty between crossing flights. The conflict resolution algorithm aims to minimize necessary temporal separation between crossing flights under uncertainty, still ensuring safety-critical spatial separation.

In summary, this research suggests that the required minimum temporal separation at a crossing waypoint is dependent on factors such as inbound crossing angle, the relative angle between wind direction and bearing of each route, wind magnitude, wind magnitude uncertainty, nominal cruise airspeed of aircraft, and look-ahead time of the conflict detection algorithm. This research also suggests that different combinations of scheduling and separation have different qualitative results.  Using a combination of strategic, flow-based scheduling, tactical scheduling at crossings, speed control near crossing points, and separation management leads to a system that is insensitive to trajectory prediction errors with high throughput and flexibility for aircraft away from shared resources."

Over time, the surface boulders associated with ejecta deposits break down into fine-grained regolith due to a combination of later impacts and thermal fatigue. Nonetheless, observations of old (>2.0 Ga) kilometer-scale (0.8–2.0 km) lunar impact craters in high-resolution images reveal >1 m boulders along their rims and in their near-proximal ejecta deposits on the lunar maria. Here, we use a combination of radar and thermal-infrared data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft to show that the rims of kilometer-sized impact craters exhibit elevated rock abundances for the lifetime of the lunar maria. We interpret these results as indicating that boulders are continually being uncovered at crater rims due to downslope movement of the overlying regolith. Moreover, rocks found at crater rims that have been exhumed from depth in geologically recent times are locally derived and unlikely to have come from other areas of the Moon. Future collection of lunar samples at crater rims will serve to mitigate the potential for sample contamination from distal sources, helping to ensure accurate geologic interpretations from the collected samples."

The on-orbit change of the value of the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is quantified by a numerical factor, called the H-factor, and is determined by the onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM). Because the spectral response function of an SDSM detector spreads in wavelength, the directly measured H-factor is the true H-factor convolved with the spectral response function. To find the true H-factor, we use the traditional direct method and an innovative iterative approach to separately deconvolve the measured H-factor. Our iterative approach relies on two properties of the SDSM detector spectral response function: the central peak width is narrow enough so that the H-factor does not change much over the peak width, and the dominance of the spectral response function’s integral with respect to the wavelength over the width. The iterative approach is more accurate, of a smaller noise impact, much more flexible in terms of interpolation and extrapolation of function values, and faster. We have used deconvolved H-factors to calibrate the NASA SNPP VIIRS RSB Collections 1 and 2 Level-1B products."

Here we approximate the mean age in terms of an ""SF6 age"" (ΓSF6), derived from surface and aircraft measurements of SF6 that are broader in spatial scope and cover a longer time period (1997-2018) than considered previously. At the surface, ΓSF6 increases from near-zero values north of 30°N to ~1.5 years over the Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropics, with the largest meridional gradients occurring in the tropics. By comparison, vertical gradients in ΓSF6 are weak throughout, with only slight increases/decreases with height in the NH/SH. The broader spatial coverage of the measurements reveals strong variations in the seasonal cycle of ΓSF6 within the (sub)tropics that are weaker over the Atlantic and Pacic oceans, compared to over the Indian Ocean. Observations from 2000-2018 reveal that the SF6 age at sites in the SH has been decreasing by ~0.12 yr/dec. However, this decrease is not due to changes in transport but, rather, is likely related to changes in emissions, which have increased globally and reportedly shifted from northern midlatitudes into the subtropics. Simulations, which reproduce the SF6 age trends, show no decreases in an age-of-air tracer, reinforcing the fact that ΓSF6 represents only an approximation to the mean age. Finally, the modeled SF6 ages are older than observed, by ~0.3-0.4 years throughout the southern extratropics. We show that this bias is partly related to an overestimation in simulated SF6 near emissions regions,"

To accomplish this, the Orbiting Sample container (OS) will be sent to Mars to accommodate the collected samples then launched from Mars and returned to Earth, where the samples will be removed for examination in the Sample Return Facility (SRF).

Crucial to this entire sequence will be establishment of the required level of cleanliness inside the OS. In February 2021, the NASA Headquarters' Mars Sample Return Program and Office of Planetary Protection assembled an MSR OS Tiger Team (OSTT) to discuss the appropriate cleanliness level options of the interior of the OS. The team's remit was primarily focused on evaluating the trade-offs between Planetary Protection cleanliness levels 4a and 4b. These cleanliness levels are determined by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) planetary protection regulations, where 4a requires <300 bacterial spores/m^2 and <3 x 10^5 bacterial spores on the spacecraft (in this case, the interior of the OS) and 4b mandates the more stringent requirement of <30 bacterial spores on the spacecraft. This report documents the consensus opinion submitted by the OSTT that recommended the interior of the OS be cleaned to a 4a requirement with any feasible added effort toward 4b. This report provides, as well, the rationale for that decision."

Through these, remote operators have learned to manage several UAS at the same time in a variety of operational environments. The present work details a component piece of an ongoing body of research into multi-UAS operations. Beginning in early 2020, NASA has collaborated with Uber Technologies to design and develop concepts of operations, roles and responsibilities, and ground control station (GCS) concepts to enable food delivery operations via multiple, small UAS (sUAS). A cognitive walkthrough was chosen as the method for data collection. This allowed information to be gathered from UAS subject matter experts (SMEs) that could further mature designs for future human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations; in addition, it allowed information to be collected remotely during the stringent restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, the described cognitive walkthrough activity utilized remote data collection protocols mediated through the usage of programs designed for presentation and telecommunications. Scenarios were designed, complete with airspace, contingencies, and remedial actions, to be presented to the SMEs. Information was collected using a combination of rating scales and open-ended questions. Results received from the SMEs revealed expected hazards, workloads, and information concerns inherent in the contingency scenarios. SMEs also provided insight into the design of GCS tools and displays as well as the duties and relationships of human operators (i.e., monitors) and automation (i.e., informers and flight managers). Implications of these findings are discussed."

Transferring  propellants  inmicrogravity environments is necessary to support the long-duration space missionsplanned for the coming decades.  A key developmental milestone to developing thiscapability fully is the simulation and experimentation of NVF/NVTO in 1-g settings.This work seeks to advance the former by assessing the effectiveness of different heattransfer correlations used in a 1-g non-equilibrium model.  Heat transfer correlationsfor natural convection and two-phase boiling heat transfer are compared against ex-perimental results for 34 different tests.  Two distinct experiments, comprised of 21tests, are presented in detail here.  These tests cover a variety of different injectionmethods, receiver tank geometries, receiver tank materials, cryogenic propellants, andinitial tank states.  Overall for the cases tested in this work, the model was able topredict the pressure response within the receiver tank to a mean absolute percentageerror of 25.9%. The temperature response error rate was 29.5% and 24.9% for wall-gasand two-phase nodes, respectively.  Compared to the worst case correlation set tested,the pressure prediction error rate represents a 31% improvement.  For the cases pre-sented in this work, the mean pressure prediction error rate was 15.5%.  Future workcould  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  this  model  against  experiments  conducted  withdifferent propellants or different initial conditions.

Unfortunately, the primary SWCX emission lines also happen to be important diagnostics of astrophysical plasmas.  Models of SWCX emission are  limited  by  two  main  uncertainties:   the  local  solar  wind  fluxes  along  the line-of-sight,  and  the  charge  exchange  cross  sections.   The  He  cone,  a  localized density enhancement of helium neutrals, is the only heliospheric SWCX emission feature  that  is  small  enough  and  bright  enough  to  be  observationally  isolated from the X-ray background and the broader SWCX emission.

The measured SWCX emission for the set of observations near the ecliptic plane were consistent with the line intensities predicted by the model, but were underpredicted for the set of observations at high ecliptic latitude near the south  ecliptic  pole.

The first objective of the investigation is to conduct computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to investigate the noise characteristics of several anti-phase rotor designs. The second objective is to conduct a series of acoustic tests of anti-phase rotors in an anechoic chamber at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) to evaluate the merit of the anti-phase rotor concept. 

The CFD investigation seeks to optimize the anti-phase alternating trailing edge patterns for rotor noise suppression. The design objective is to maximize the noise reduction while maintaining the aerodynamic thrust. The investigation is performed using a three-dimensional (3D) Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) commercial solver STAR-CCM+ together with the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) formula to obtain the aerodynamic thrust and far-field noise level. An acoustic study is conducted for 13 anti-phase design candidates based on a proprietary rotor design. The CAD geometry of the rotor is furnished by PSU. These design candidates include different alternating trailing edge (TE) waveforms, TE segment lengths, TE deflection amplitudes, and transition characteristics. The best design candidate among those explored is an anti-phase rotor that has a four-period TE waveform which results in a reduction in far-field noise level of 2.1 dB in the hover condition and a reduction of 1.1 dB in the forward flight condition at 9.7 m/s. 

A further acoustic study is conducted for a different rotor manufactured by APC. Five APC rotor design candidates are simulated. The best anti-phase design candidate for the APC rotor results in a reduction in far-field noise level of 4.0 dB in the hover condition. An in-phase design candidate is also studied. This in-phase design provides a noise reduction of 2.5 dB. 

A series of acoustic experiments in the PSU anechoic chamber have been conducted in July 2019 and October 2019. Both anti-phase and in-phase rotors fabricated for the left-hand and right-hand rotations are tested. In the hover condition, all the rotors do not provide sufficient evidence of improved acoustic performance. However, the experimental data in the hover condition are deemed to be inconclusive due to the flow recirculation in the anechoic chamber caused by the rotor downwash. In the forward flight condition at 9.7 m/s, the anti-phase right-hand rotor produces a noise reduction by as much as 6.5 dB in the frequency range of 2000-4000 Hz, while the in-phase right-hand rotor produces a noise reduction by as much as 5 dB in the same frequency range. Both the anti-phase and in-phase left hand rotors offer no evidence of noise reduction. The difference in the acoustic performance of the left-hand and right-hand rotors could be explained by the location of the microphone array which is placed to the left side of the rotors. This microphone array location could create a bias in the sound pressure level in favor of the right-hand rotor. Using the average noise reduction values, the anti-phase 4H rotor could offer a noise reduction by as much as 3.25 dB while the in-phase 4I rotor could produce up to a 2.5 dB noise reduction. Both the computational and experimental results have provided sufficient evidence to support the noise suppression capability of the proposed anti-phase rotor concepts."

to the warm-core nature of the system with peak velocities located at lower levels.
One barrier that has inhibited a more complete characterization of energy transfer in
the boundary layer is a lack of observations that resolve large, turbulent eddies. In
particular, the occurrence and structure of upscale energy transfer (backscatter) in the
hurricane boundary layer as well as the effects of backscatter on the vortex intensity
are unknown. The analysis presented here of very high-resolution, three-dimensional
wind observations from Hurricane Rita (2005) at peak intensity reveals large regions of
organized backscatter in the boundary layer associated with coherent, turbulent eddies.
Strong forwardscatter is also found next to the backscatter regions due to the interaction
between adjacent eddies. Two components of the stress tensor are primarily responsible
for this alternating scatter structure, as shown by large correlation coefficients between
the fields: the radial–vertical component (τ13) and the azimuthal–vertical component
(τ23) with average correlations of 79% and 49 %, respectively. The Leonard, Reynolds
and cross-term stress components are also provided. The impact of the sub-filter-scale
energy transfer is estimated by computing the kinetic energy budget for the resolved-scale
and eddy-scale motions. The results show that the sub-filter-scale energy transfer term
is of the same order as the other terms in the eddy-scale budgets, contributing between
16% and 40% to the local time tendency with an average contribution of approximately
30 %. These results indicate that the coherent turbulent eddies can affect the vortex
dynamics through wave–wave nonlinear interactions, which can subsequently influence
the wave–mean flow interactions. This is the first study to examine the full sub-filter-scale"

The dynamic coupling between the test article and test fixture complicates the model updating process because significant effort needs to be spent on modeling the test fixture and boundary conditions in addition to the test article. If the modal results could be corrected for fixture coupling, then setups used for other structural testing could be adequate for modal testing and would allow significant schedule and cost savings by eliminating a unique setup for only modal testing. To simplify future modal tests, this report describes a Fixed Base Correction method that was investigated during modal testing of a full-scale, half-span,  flexible wing cantilevered from a static test fixture. The results of this Fixed Base Correction approach look very promising. The method aided in producing similar wing modal characteristics for two different physical boundary configurations of a dynamically active test fixture."

Several studies have searched for such a signature, as summarized in Buratti et al.; however, none has yet produced sufficient evidence to dissipate doubts. In the radiation environment characteristic of Saturn's icy moons, the presence of crystalline H2O ice has been used as a marker of a high-temperature region. Because ion bombardment will, over time, drive crystalline ice toward an increasingly amorphous state, the current phase of the H2O ice can be used to gauge the temporal temperature evolution of the surface. We adopt a technique described by Dalle Ore et al. to map the fraction of amorphous to crystalline H2O ice on Dione's surface, observed by the Cassini Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer, and provide an ice exposure age. We focus on a region observed at high spatial resolution and centered on one of the faults of the Wispy Terrain, which is measured to be fully crystalline. By assuming an amorphous to crystalline ice fraction of 5% (i.e., 95% crystallinity), significantly higher than the actual measurement, we obtain an upper limit for the age of the fault of 152 Ma. This implies that the studied fault has been active in the last ~100 Ma, supporting the hypothesis that Dione might still be active or was active a very short time ago, and similarly to Enceladus, might still be harboring a body of liquid water under its crust."

Determining the effects of high energy radiation and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on these organic compounds is critical for understanding the potential for the preservation of organic molecules associated with past or present life, and where to look for possible chemical bio- signatures during future Mars missions. Understanding how these effects are attenuated by the mineral matrix and the depth at which they are buried have been challenging to determine in situ on Mars. There have been very few experimental studies on the survival of organic compounds under radiation from a gamma source under realistic conditions, and their interpretation until now has been difficult due to the lack of data for actual radiation levels on Mars. Using the in-situ data obtained by the MSL/RAD instrument to anchor the dose calculations, here we show that the N-heterocycles purine and uracil, crucial components of biochemical processes in extant living systems, mixed with calcite, anhydrite, and kaolinite as Mars analogue minerals can survive the effects of radiation with a dose corresponding to ~500,000 years on the Martian surface. The extent of survival varied not only with the nature of the organic compound, but its depth from the surface. These results provide new experimental data for the degree of protection offered by the regolith, in conjunction with minerals, for organic compounds that may be present on Mars."

Their basin has become a regional hotspot of climatic   and    limnological    change, potentially    threatening    its    vital    natural    resources.  Consequentially, there is a need to assess the current state of climate models regarding their performance across the Great Lakes region and develop the next generation of high-resolution regional   climate   models to   address   complex   limnological   processes   and lake-atmosphere interactions. In response to this need, the current paper focuses on the generation and analysis of a 20-member ensemble of 3-km National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) simulations for the 2014-2015 cold season.  The study aims to identify the model’s strengths and weaknesses; optimal configuration for the region; and the impacts of different physics parameterizations, coupling to a 1D lake model, time-variant lake-surface temperatures, and spectral nudging. Several  key  biases  are  identified  in  the cold-season simulations for the Great Lakes region, including an atmospheric cold bias that is amplified by coupling to a 1D lake model but diminished by applying the Community Atmosphere Model radiation scheme and Morrison microphysics scheme; an excess precipitation bias; anomalously early initiation of fall lake turnover and subsequent cold lake bias; excessive and overly persistent lake ice cover; and insufficient evaporation over Lakes Superior and Huron. The research team is currently addressing these key limitations by coupling NU-WRF to a 3D lake model in support of the next generation of regional climate models for the critical Great Lakes Basin."

Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in the development and application of ST-ChlF methods in aquatic ecosystems, and in the interpretation of the resulting observations. At the same time, however, an increasing number of sensor types, sampling protocols, and data processing algorithms have created confusion and uncertainty among potential users, with a growing divergence of practice among different research groups. In this review, we assist the existing and upcoming user community by providing an overview of current approaches and consensus recommendations for the use of ST-ChlF measurements to examine in-situ phytoplankton productivity and photo-physiology. We argue that a consistency of practice and adherence to basic operational and quality control standards is critical to ensuring data inter-comparability. Large datasets of inter-comparable and globally coherent ST-ChlF observations hold the potential to reveal large-scale patterns and trends in phytoplankton photo-physiology, photosynthetic rates and bottom-up controls on primary productivity. As such, they hold great potential to provide invaluable physiological observations on the scales relevant for the development and validation of ecosystem models and remote sensing algorithms."

MERRA-2 reanalysis. A dynamically consistent response is found in terms of static stability, zonal wind, and upwelling. Eruptions are found to bias the QBO towards a westerly state, such that the QBO period response depends upon the phase at the time of
eruption. The QBO does not have a clear amplitude response to an eruption, based on

Magnetospheric models determine the plasma properties on magnetic field lines connected to the auroral ionosphere, but the precipitation of energetic

This absorption is indicative of carbon species, including organics, on the sur-face.

Aims: We aim to describe the composition of the organic matter on Bennu by investigating the spectral features in detail.

Methods: We use a curated set of spectra acquired by the OSIRIS-REx Visible and InfraRed Spectrometer  (OVIRS)  that  have  features  near  3.4μm  (3.2  to  3.6μm)  attributed  to  organics. We assess the shapes and strengths of these absorptions in the context of laboratory spectra of extraterrestrial organics and analogs.

Results: We find spectral evidence of aromatic and aliphatic CH bonds. The absorptions are broadly consistent in shape and depth with those associated with insoluble organic matter in meteorites. Given the thermal and space weathering environments on Bennu, it is likely that the organics have not been exposed for long enough to substantially decrease the H/C and destroy all aliphatic molecules."

NASA ARC is partnering with NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to provide a comprehensive sensor suite, including a DLR-provided Data Acquisition System (DAS). DrEAM will provide key aerothermodynamic data and performance analysis for Dragonfly’s forebody and backshell Thermal Protection System (TPS).
Titan’s atmosphere predominantly consists of ni-trogen (~98% by mole) with small amounts of me-thane (~2% by mole) and other trace gases. CN is a strong radiator, and is found in nonequilibrium con-centrations for Titan entry. The accurate modeling of nonequilibrium CN radiation has proven to be a diffi-cult task. Prompted by the Huygens mission, many experimental campaigns and analyses were performed to better understand the aerothermal environments experienced by the probe during Titan entry [1]. How-ever, the Huygens probe carried no heatshield instru-mentation. Therefore, the DrEAM sensor suite will sig-nificantly advance the state-of-the-art not only by documenting the environment and performance of Dragonfly’s entry system but also by making key in situ measurements in Titan’s atmosphere for the first time.
Aerothermal environments and TPS response will be measured using sensors whose flight heritage is tak-en from the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing In-strumentation 2 (MEDLI2) thermocouple plugs and the COMbined Aerothermal and Radiometer Sensor (COMARS) suite [2], with the latter supplied by DLR. The MEDLI2 project used embedded thermocouples to directly measure the in-depth TPS temperature-time history at several locations on the heat shield and backshell of the Mars 2020 entry vehicle. These tem-perature measurements, in turn, can be used to infer surface environments via an inverse analysis proce-dure analogous to that used for MEDLI. For DrEAM, the thermocouple plug subsystem will be known as Dragonfly Sensors for Aero-Thermal Reconstruction (DragSTR). On Schiaparelli, the COMARS suite in-cluded three total surface-mounted heat flux sensors, three pressure sensors, and one radiometer. For DrEAM, the COMARS package will be known as the COmbined Sensor System for Titan Atmosphere (COSSTA). Since the methane concentration in the Titan atmos-phere is directly proportional to the radiative heat flux, the COSSTA measurements will be used to reduce the current uncertainty in the methane volume fraction. Atmospheric density measurements and capsule aero-dynamic data will be obtained through the onboard Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), supplemented by pressure transducers similar to those used by the MEDLI and MEDLI2 projects. The DrEAM pressure sensors will be known as the Dragonfly Atmospheric Flight Transducers. (DrAFT). The pressure measure-ments, when combined with data from the on-board IMU, will allow for reconstruction of such quantities as vehicle Mach number, freestream density, and atmos-pheric winds. DrAFT measurements will enhance Dragonfly trajectory reconstruction and enable a sepa-ration of the aerodynamics from the atmosphere, as was done for MEDLI [3] and is currently in process for the MEDLI2 flight data set."

This paper focuses on mitigation of shot noise which is introduced into the image data set by the cameras. Shot noise impacts the quality of data collected, increasing the system error in its pressure value calculations. This paper characterises statistical methods to reduce shot noise within experimental data by taking an average or weighted average across an area of pixels of their respective counts. Each combined-pixel has a higher total effective intensity value and therefore exhibits reduced noise throughout its time history. This is demonstrated by calculating the standard deviations of the combined pixel values through time, which decrease as the combined pixel area increases. Finally, these methods are compared across experimental wind tunnel conditions to examine their effectiveness at different Mach numbers. Ultimately, the results are used to recommend a blur filter type and size which will be applied to the raw image data prior to processing, as well as a minimum camera resolution for future experiments. Downstream of the filter application, the software to convert the 2D image data sets into surface pressure readings on a 3D grid use a ratio of decimation that assigns multiple pixels to each 3D grid node. This decimation ratio will also be aligned with the size of the blur filter, resulting in a more manageable data set size and compromised spatial resolution. Combined with the effect of the blur filter, the resulting pixel intensity readings will exhibit significantly reduced shot noise, reducing the magnitude of uncertainty and error in the final calculated pressure. For future tests, the camera spatial resolution must be sufficient to capture small flow and model features even after the recommended blur filter is applied. The image data set is taken from a uPSP experiment of the Space Launch System Block 1 cargo vehicle model in September 2019."

If these features are indeed explosive calderas, dispersion modeling suggests extensive ash deposits should be common throughout the region. However, such deposits have not previously been linked with the suggested calderas. Here, we describe layered deposits containing minerals both consistent with and diagnostic of altered volcanic ash throughout Arabia Terra.
These deposits include Al-dominant minerals such as montmorillonite, imogolite, and allophane among others. Altered ash deposits are found to thin (from 1-km to 100-m thickness) away from the suggested calderas. We estimate that the volcanic ash observed in Arabia Terra is the result of between 1,000 and 2,000 individual explosive eruptions over 500-million years. Our observations support the hypothesis that Arabia Terra hosted supereruptions in the late Noachian-early Hesperian that repeatedly blanketed the region with layers of ash."

Snow distribution is a function of interactions among static variables, such as terrain, vegetation, and soil properties, and dynamic meteorological variables, such as solar radiation, wind speed and direction, and soil moisture. However, identifying the dominant physical drivers responsible for spatial patterns of the snowpack, particularly for ephemeral, shallow snowpacks, has been challenging due to the lack of the high-resolution snowpack and physical variables with high vertical accuracy as well as inherent limitations in traditional approaches. This study uses an Unpiloted Aerial System (UAS) lidar-based snow depth and static variables (1-m spatial resolution) to analyze field-scale spatial structures of snow depth and apply the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model to identify primary controls over open terrain and forests at the University of New Hampshire Thompson Farm Research Observatory, New Hampshire, United States. We found that, among nine topographic and soil variables, plant functional type and terrain roughness contribute up to 80% and 76% of relative importance in the MaxEnt framework to predict locations of deeper or shallower snowpacks, respectively, across a mixed temperate forested and field landscape. Soil variables, such as organic matter and saturated hydraulic conductivity, were also important controls (up to 70% and 81%) on snow depth spatial variations for both open and forested landscapes suggesting spatial variations in soil variables under snow can control thermal transfer among soil, snowpack, and surface-atmosphere. This work contributes to improving land surface and snow models by informing parameterization of the sub-grid scale snow depths, down-scaling remotely sensed snow products, and understanding field scale snow states."

This paper presents the first attempt at producing a drop in replacement for hydraulic cylinders on heavy construction equipment with an electromechanical actuator utilizing pulleys for the conversion of a single motor’s rotational motion to bidirectional linear motion. By utilizing a twin block and tackle arrangement and paired spools, the system can generate bidirectional motion nearly identical to a hydraulic cylinder. More importantly, the use of rope builds in shock resistance to the system which is often a weak point for screw style actuators. Significant work remains to refine the concept into flight hardware, but the concept shows promise. The produced actuator can be applied or scaled for near direct replacement of hydraulic cylinders on terrestrial mining and construction equipment for faster development of off Earth use."

One of these water bodies include the Little Patuxent River (LPR) in the Anne Arundel and Howard Counties in Maryland, which is the subject of this report.
In the 1996, 1998, and then 2006 Maryland Integrated Report, the LPR was found to be impaired by nutrients, bacteria, suspended sediments, and cadmium (Cd). As a result, TMDLs were created to limit factors that were contributing to these problems (Maryland Department of the Environment 2011, December). But later in 2008 and 2009, water quality analyses (WQAs) found that the LPR’s condition had improved. From a Category 5 Cd and phosphorus classification in 1996 it was reduced to Category 2 in 2008 for Cd and in 2009 for phosphorus (Maryland Department of the Environment 2011, December).
However, it has been more than a decade since the last WQA and the environmental conditions may have changed. This lack of testing could result in untracked, accumulated damages to the overall health of the LPR.

As a first step, we studied the effects of spatial averaging the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD retrievals, and of temporal averaging the AERONET AOD around the satellite (Aqua) overpass, on the agreement between the two products. AERONET AOD averaging over a time-window of ±15 min around the satellite overpass and the 1 ×1 km2 spatial grid of MAIAC were found to provide the best AOD retrieval performance. Next, MAIAC AOD were stratified according to different co-measured environmental attributes (aerosol loading, dominant particle size, vegetation cover, and prevailing particle type) and analyzed against the AERONET AOD. The envelope of the expected retrieval error varied considerably among different environmental attributes categories, with more accurate AOD retrievals obtained over highly vegetated areas (i.e. less surface reflectance) than over arid areas. Moreover, the retrieval accuracy was found to be sensitive to the aerosol loading and particle size, with a large bias between the MAIAC and AERONET AOD during high aerosol loading of coarse particles. In addition, the retrieval accuracy of MAIAC AOD was found to depend on the aerosol type due to the aerosol model assumptions regarding their optical properties."

We used the IGRF 12th to remove the long-wavelength regional anomalies. We  will use an inverse procedure, which always requires a solution of the direct problem, and a  horizontal polygonal prism given in the Descartes coordinate system.

An accurate prediction of future states of ecosystems depends on not only model structures but also parameterizations. Model parameters can be constrained by data assimilation. However, applications of data assimilation to ecology are restricted by highly technical requirements such as model-dependent coding. To alleviate this technical burden, we developed a model-independent data assimilation (MIDA) module. MIDA works in three steps including data preparation, execution of data assimilation, and visualization. The first step prepares prior ranges of parameter values, a defined number of iterations, and directory paths to access files of observations and models. The execution step calibrates parameter values to best fit the observations and estimates the parameter posterior distributions. The final step automatically visualizes the calibration performance and posterior distributions. MIDA is model independent, and modelers can use MIDA for an accurate and efficient data assimilation in a simple and interactive way without modification of their original models. We applied MIDA to four types of ecological models: the data assimilation linked ecosystem carbon (DALEC) model, a surrogate-based energy exascale earth system model: the land component (ELM), nine phenological models and a stand-alone biome ecological strategy simulator (BiomeE). The applications indicate that MIDA can effectively solve data assimilation problems for different ecological models. Additionally, the easy implementation and model-independent feature of MIDA breaks the technical barrier of applications of data–model fusion in ecology. MIDA facilitates the assimilation of various observations into models for uncertainty reduction in ecological modeling and forecasting."

The scanner assembly consists of a rotating polygon scanner for line scanning along the fast axis, a galvanometer (galvo) scanner for scanning along the slow axis, angular position sensors and motor controllers. The polygon scanner sweeps the lidar beam at up to 10,000 lines/s across a 27 deg angular field-of-regard in the fast axis, while the galvo scanner covers an angular range of 20 deg in the slow axis.

Kevlar® KM2® has become an essential element of numerous meteoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shield systems primarily as a multi-layer insulation (MLI) enhancement, and as such,  the  migration  has  implications  for  numerous  system  level  risk  assessments  for  future vehicles that will need to use the newer KM2® Plus fiber system. While the chemical makeup of the  two  fabrics  are  identical,  differences  in  processing  have  yielded  higher  tenacities  and toughness  for  the  KM2®  Plus  system.  To  address  this  migration,  the  Hypervelocity  Impact Technology (HVIT) group in NASA Exploration Sciences at Johnson Space Center (JSC) has worked with the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC), the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and the MPCV European Service Module (MPCV-ESM) group of the European Space Agency (ESA) with its contractors Airbus and Thales Alenia Space-Italy (TAS-I) to study how KM2® Plus in the woven form of 850 denier 775 compares with  KM2® in the woven form of 850 denier 705. The two forms of Kevlar® fabrics have been compared by direct-impact with a known mass and as the rear wall in Whipple shields using the two-stage, light-gas-gun at the Remote Hypervelocity Test Laboratory (RHTL) of NASA JSC White Sands Test Facility (WSTF). From these  examinations,  it  has  been  found  that  KM2®  Plus  does  in  fact  improve  the  ballistic performance as  a  ballistic  enhancement  of MLI with  an  estimated  improvement of  9.5±6.1% between the two fabrics, and on a mass basis, the estimated mass of KM2® Plus 775 is 3.6±0.7% lighter than KM2 705, which means the mass performance improvement is even higher."

ATLAS is a single wavelength (532 nm) lidar system designed to acquire high resolution measurements of the earth's surface while also obtaining atmospheric backscatter from molecules, clouds, and aerosols. Because ATLAS is optimized for altimetry, the atmospheric data acquired is unique in many respects and requires non-standard analysis techniques. For example, the high repetition rate laser limits the vertical extent of the profiles to just 14 km and causes atmospheric scattering from above 15 km to be added to the scattering in the lower 0–14 km profile. In addition, the limited vertical range of the acquired profiles renders it difficult to compute the magnitude of the solar background and hinders the application of standard calibration techniques. Despite these limitations, methods have been developed to successfully produce data products that have value to the atmospheric community for cloud and aerosol research and are currently available at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). In this paper we describe the ICESat-2 atmospheric channel and the methods used to process the ATLAS raw photon count data to obtain calibrated backscatter and higher level products such as layer heights and type, blowing snow, column optical depth and apparent surface reflectance."

However, at spatial scales between 1 to 10 km (grey scales), these improvements are often illusive due to the competing benefits from spatial resolution and  cumulus  parameterization. This study provides insights into the  impact of model  resolution and cumulus parameterization on precipitation prediction in the Central Great Plains by using an object-based evaluation  method. Our  results show  limited  improvement solely  from finer  resolution but  larger improvement without using the cumulus scheme at a 4-kmresolution. Compared to traditional evaluation methods,  the  object-based  analysis  shows  that  without  the  cumulus  scheme  the  spatial  properties  of precipitation are better represented. In contrast, all model configurations show a dry bias in precipitation days  and  a tendency  to  produce  widespread  precipitation  but  with  fewer  hours  with  precipitationwhich indicates other shortcomings in the model."

Our best tools to capture state-of-the-art knowledge in an internally self-consistent modelling framework are the increasingly complex fully coupled Earth System Models (ESMs). However, computational limitations and the structural rigidity of ESMs mean that the full range of uncertainties across multiple domains are difficult to capture with ESMs alone. The tools of choice are instead more computationally efficient reduced complexity models (RCMs), which are structurally flexible and can span the response dynamics across a range of domain-specific models and ESM experiments. Here we present Phase 2 of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP Phase 2), the first comprehensive intercomparison of RCMs that are probabilistically calibrated with key benchmark ranges from specialized research communities. Unsurprisingly, but crucially, we find that models which have been constrained to reflect the key benchmarks better reflect the key benchmarks. Under the low-emissions SSP1-1.9 scenario, across the RCMs, median peak warming projections range from 1.3 to 1.7°C (relative to 1850-1900, using an observationally-based historical warming estimate of 0.8°C between 1850-1900 and 1995-2014). Further developing methodologies to constrain these projection uncertainties seems paramount given the international community's goal to contain warming to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial in the long-term. Our findings suggest that users of RCMs should carefully evaluate their RCM, specifically its skill against key benchmarks and consider the need to include projections benchmarks either from ESM results or other assessments to reduce divergence in future projections."

The data cover 11 epochs from 2009 to 2020. Long-term monotonic trends in size and shape previously noted from the visible cloud appearance are paralleled by changes in the high-speed ring around the vortex. The circularization of the GRS cannot be explained by changes in the horizontal wind shear of the surrounding environment. The velocity fields suggest no long-term trend in the static stability inside or outside the vortex. Instead, the changes are accompanied by a 4%–8% increase in the mean wind speeds of the high-speed ring from 2009 to 2020. Changes in the wind field coincided with the South Equatorial Belt Outbreak storms of 2016–2017, but not with 2019 ""flaking"" events involving detachment of red material from the main oval."

Extensive research and development has been performed on EBCs, and their corresponding failure mechanisms under different environmental conditions. However, one key failure mechanism, solid particle erosion (SPE), has not been thoroughly investigated. As a result, the present work investigates the SPE behavior of a ytterbium disilicate (Yb2Si2O7) environmental barrier coating (EBC) deposited via plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD). Erosion testing was performed at elevated temperature (1,200 °C) in a simulated combustion environment at the NASA Glenn Research Center Erosion Burner Rig Facility. Alumina (Al2O3) particles were used as the eroding media. A range of particle kinetic energies and impingement angles were investigated along with the effect of coating surface roughness. The post-erosion damage morphology was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SPE behavior of the PS-PVD EBC was shown to be comparable to other EBC systems reported in the literature."

Soil moisture is a valuable indicator of drought and flood vulnerability but can be difficult to measure since in situ monitoring is limited to discrete stations throughout the state. The team created a framework to compare in situ, modeled, and NASA satellite soil moisture measurements to increase the spatial coverage of soil moisture monitoring. The team partnered with the Illinois State Weather Survey, USDA Midwest Climate Hub, NOAA Regional Climate Services of the Central Region, NOAA National Integrated Drought Information System’s Midwest Drought Early Warning System, and the NOAA North Central River ForecastCenter. The team standardized and compared soil moisture data from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, modeled soil moisture outputs from NASA’s SPoRT Land Information System (SPoRT-LIS), and in situ measurements from the Illinois State Weather Survey’s Water and Atmospheric Resources Monitoring (WARM) program. Compared to the WARM data, the satellite and modeled data showed seasonally variable differences and bias. The difference was highest in the winter months and lowest in the late summer and early fall months for the SMAP and SPoRT-LIS data products. SPoRT-LIS produced lower seasonal variability and SMAP demonstrated higher correlation values and lower differences. These analyses suggest that both SMAP and SPoRT-LIS products offer unique strengths and limitations when used for soil moisture monitoring"

A warming climate makes this carbon increasingly vulnerable to decomposition and release into the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases. The resulting climate feedback can be estimated using land surface models, but the high complexity and computational cost of these models make it challenging to use them for estimating uncertainty, exploring novel scenarios, and coupling with other models. We have added a representation of permafrost to the simple, open-source global carbon–climate model Hector, calibrated to be consistent with both historical data and 21st century Earth system model projections of permafrost thaw. We include permafrost as a separate land carbon pool that becomes available for decomposition into both methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) once thawed; the thaw rate is controlled by region-specific air temperature increases from a preindustrial baseline. We found that by 2100 thawed permafrost carbon emissions increased Hector’s atmospheric CO2 concentration by 5 %–7 % and the atmospheric CH4 concentration by 7 %–12 %, depending on the future scenario, resulting in 0.2–0.25 ∘C of additional warming over the 21st century. The fraction of thawed permafrost carbon available for decomposition was the most significant parameter controlling the end-of-century temperature change in the model, explaining around 70 % of the temperature variance, and was distantly followed by the initial stock of permafrost carbon, which contributed to about 10 % of the temperature variance. The addition of permafrost in Hector provides a basis for the exploration of a suite of science questions, as Hector can be cheaply run over a wide range of parameter values to explore uncertainty and can be easily coupled with integrated assessment and other human system models to explore the economic consequences of warming from this feedback."

Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70_ N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest–steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM2:5 emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65_ N are larger than emissions from heanthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60_ N, with 56% of black carbon emissions above 65_ N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning – indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic  wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities."

A comparison of the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievalsfor GPM (IMERG) and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stationsversion 2 (CHIRPS2) rainfall products over the continentalUnited States (CONUS) wasperformed to quantify the impacts of the daily distributionof precipitation on biases anderrors in soil moisture, runoff, and evapotranspiration (ET). Since the total accumulatedprecipitation between the IMERG and CHIRPS product differed, a third precipitationproduct, CHIRPS-to-IMERG (CHtoIM), was produced that usedCHIRPS2 accumulatedprecipitation totals and the daily precipitation frequency distribution of IMERG. Thisnew product supported a controlled analysis of the impact ofprecipitation frequencydistribution on simulated hydrological fields. The CHtoIM had higher occurrences ofprecipitation in the 0–5 mm day−1range, with a lower occurrence of dry days, whichdecreased soil moisture and surface runoff in the land-surface model. The surface soillayer had a tendency to reach saturation more often in the CHIRPS2 simulations, wherethe number of moderate to heavy precipitation days (>5mm day−1) was increased. Usingthe blended CHtoIM product as input reduced errors in surface soil moisture by 5–15%when compared to Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) data.Similarly, ET errors werealso slightly decreased (∼2%) when compared to SSEBop data. Moderate changes indaily precipitation distributions had a quantifiable impact on soil moisture, runoff, andET. These changes usually improved the model when compared to other modeled andobservational datasets, but the magnitude of the improvements varied by region andtime of year."

However, the mechanics involved in formation of these outlets has not been studied in detail.  Here, we study this outlet formation process through a series of numerical experiments accomplished by adding erosion and sediment transport routines to an existing hydrodynamic simulation, ANUGA. These experiments are consistent with outlets being carved in single flood events, at least if sediment was available throughout outlet formation as in a transport-limited regime. Peak discharges from these open-basin lakes, including from Jezero crater, were 10^4–10^6 m^3/s, and the outlet-forming floods lasted for days to weeks, depending on lake size. Moreover, we find that sediment transport by suspension was likely important during these floods – outlets could not have reached their observed sizes if flow was limited to bedload transport alone. This in turn may explain why small open-basin lakes are less commonly recognized on Mars, as small lakes had less inherent capacity to transport sediment in suspension and thus incise confining topography catastrophically. Geometry, topographic setting, and earlier fluvial valley development may have played a significant role in influencing the magnitude of outlet-forming floods and resulting outlet canyon incision."

Search results are presented for gravitational waves produced by cosmic string loop features such as cusps, kinks, and, for the first time, kink-kink collisions. A template-based search for short-duration transient signals does not yield a detection. We also use the stochastic gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits derived from the O3 data to constrain the cosmic string tension Gμ as a function of the number of kinks, or the number of cusps, for two cosmic string loop distribution models. Additionally, we develop and test a third model that interpolates between these two models. Our results improve upon the previous LIGO–Virgo constraints on Gμ by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude depending on the model that is tested. In particular, for the one-loop distribution model, we set the most competitive constraints to date: Gμ ≲ 4×10−15. In the case of cosmic strings formed at the end of inflation in the context of grand unified theories, these results challenge simple inflationary models."

We observe several characteristics of the merging binary black hole (BBH) population not discernible until now. First, the primary mass spectrum contains structure beyond a power law with a sharp high-mass cutoff; it is more consistent with a broken power law with a break at 39.7^(+20.3)(-9.1)M or a power law with a Gaussian feature peaking at 33.1^(+4.0)(-5.6)M (90% credible interval). While the primary mass distribution must extend to ~65M or beyond, only 2.9^(+3.5)(-1.7)M% of systems have primary masses greater than 45M. Second, we find that a fraction of BBH systems have component spins misaligned with the orbital angular momentum, giving rise to precession of the orbital plane. Moreover, 12% to 44% of BBH systems have spins tilted by more than 90°, giving rise to a negative effective inspiral spin parameter, χeff. Under the assumption that such systems can only be formed by dynamical interactions, we infer that between 25% and 93% of BBHs with nonvanishing |χeff| > 0.01 are dynamically assembled. Third, we estimate merger rates, finding RBBH = 23.9^(+14.3)(-8.6) Gpc^(-3) yr^(-1) for BBHs and RBNS = 320^(+490)(-240) Gpc^(-3) yr^(-1) for binary neutron stars. We find that the BBH rate likely increases with redshift (85% credibility) but not faster than the star formation rate (86% credibility). Additionally, we examine recent exceptional events in the context of our population models, finding that the asymmetric masses of GW190412 and the high component masses of GW190521 are consistent with our models, but the low secondary mass of GW190814 makes it an outlier."

Using events detected by LIGO-Virgo up to 1 October 2019, we evaluate the consistency of the data with predictions from the theory. We first establish that residuals from the best-fit waveform are consistent with detector noise, and that the low- and high-frequency parts of the signals are in agreement. We then consider parametrized modifications to the waveform by varying post-Newtonian and phenomenological coefficients, improving past constraints by factors of ∼2; we also find consistency with Kerr black holes when we specifically target signatures of the spin-induced quadrupole moment. Looking for gravitational-wave dispersion, we tighten constraints on Lorentz-violating coefficients by a factor of ∼2.6 and bound the mass of the graviton to m(g)≤1.76 x 10^(-23) eV/sq. c with 90% credibility. We also analyze the properties of the merger remnants by measuring ringdown frequencies and damping times, constraining fractional deviations away from the Kerr frequency to δ{\hat {f}}(220)=0.03(+0.38,-0.35) for the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and δ{\hat {f}}(221)=0.04(+0.27,-0.32) for the first overtone; additionally, we find no evidence for postmerger echoes. Finally, we determine that our data are consistent with tensorial polarizations through a template-independent method. When possible, we assess the validity of general relativity based on collections of events analyzed jointly. We find no evidence for new physics beyond general relativity, for black hole mimickers, or for any unaccounted systematics."

While precise two dimensional positional information is easy to obtain for observations in the electromagnetic spectrum, the positional accuracy of current and near future gravitational wave detectors is limited to between tens and hundreds of square degrees, which makes it extremely challenging to identify the host galaxies of gravitational wave events or to detect any electromagnetic counterparts. Gravitational wave observations provide information on source properties that is complementary to the information in any associated electromagnetic emission. Observing systems with multiple messengers thus has scientific potential much greater than the sum of its parts. A gravitational wave detector with higher angular resolution would significantly increase the prospects for finding the hosts of gravitational wave sources and triggering a multi-messenger follow-up campaign. An observatory with arcminute precision or better could be realised within the Voyage 2050 programme by creating a large baseline interferometer array in space and would have transformative scientific potential. Precise positional information of standard sirens would enable precision measurements of cosmological parameters and offer new insights on structure formation; a high angular resolution gravitational wave observatory would allow the detection of a stochastic background and resolution of the anisotropies within it; it would also allow the study of accretion processes around black holes; and it would have tremendous potential for tests of modified gravity and the discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model."

We apply our magnetically driven wind models in the context of magnetohydrodynamic(MHD)calculations to constrain(1)their global density slope(p),(2)their density (n17) at the foot point of the inner most launching radius, and(3)the abundances of heavier elements(AFe,S,Si). Incorporating the MHD winds into xstar photoionization calculations in a self-consistent manner, we create a library of synthetic absorption spectra given the observed X-ray continua. Our analysis clearly indicates a characteristic bimodal transition of multi-ion X-ray winds; i.e., the wind density gradient is found to steepen(fro mp∼1.2–1.4 to∼1.4–1.5)while its density normalization declines as the source transitions from the wind-onto the wind-off state. The model implies that the ionized wind remains physically present even in the wind-off state, despite its apparent absence in the observed spectra. Super solar abundances for heavier elements are also favored. Our global multi-ion wind models, taking into account soft X-ray ions as well as Fe K absorbers, show that the internal wind condition plays an important role in wind transitions besides photoionization changes. Simulated XRISM/Resolve and Athena/X-IFU spectra are presented to demonstrate a high fidelity of the multi-ion wind model for a better understanding of these powerful ionized winds in the coming decades"

Even specially designed radiation-hardened parts may not be tolerant to all types of radiation effects. Radiation hardness is a multi-dimensional property of any part that describes intrinsic abilities to tolerate various radiation environments [1,2].  Effects to be concerned with include total ionizing dose, total non-ionizing dose, and single-event effects (SEE) – all of which depend on the mission, environment, application, and lifetime. Radiation effects concerns may be the same whether a EEE part is Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), MIL-SPEC, or some other variant, all of which are susceptible to the same radiation threats [3]. SEE consequences range from recoverable faults to catastrophic failure. Like other random faults, SEE can be mitigated with informed circuit design practices at the device, card, and/or system level."

The search is enabled by a contemporaneous timing ephemeris obtained using Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data. The NICER ephemeris has also been extended through 2020 October and includes three new glitches. PSR J0537−6910 has the largest spin-down luminosity of any pulsar and exhibits fRequent and strong glitches. Analyses of its long-term and interglitch braking indices provide intriguing evidence that its spin-down energy budget may include gravitational-wave emission from a time-varying mass quadrupole moment. Its 62 Hz rotation frequency also puts its possible gravitational-wave emission in the most sensitive band of the LIGO/Virgo detectors. Motivated by these considerations, we search for gravitational-wave emission at both once and twice the rotation frequency from PSR J0537−6910. We find no signal, however, and report upper limits. Assuming a rigidly rotating triaxial star, our constraints reach below the gravitational-wave spin-down limit for this star for the first time by more than a factor of 2 and limit gravitational waves from the l = m = 2 mode to account for less than 14% of the spin-down energy budget. The fiducial equatorial ellipticity is constrained to less than about 3 ×10^(−5), which is the third best constraint for any young pulsar."

The computational method employs transient analysis to predict detailed interfacial behavior and heat transfer characteristics along a rectangular channel heated along two opposite walls.  Predicted results are validated against experimental temperature measurements and high-speed video images captured during a series of parabolic aircraft maneuvers for three sets of operating conditions which include variations of both mass velocity and wall heat flux.  The computational method is based on the multi-phase volume of fluid (VOF) model, which is combined with appropriate phase change and turbulence models, and accounts for both shear-lift force on bubbles and conjugate heat transfer along the heating walls.  A key advantage of the CFD method is ability to capture details that are very difficult to measure experimentally, including detailed spatial variations of bubble shape, void fraction, mixture fluid temperature, liquid velocity, and vapor velocity, results for which are presented for each of the three test cases.  Different flow regimes predicted along the heated length exhibit a number of dominant mechanisms including bubble nucleation, bubble growth, coalescence, vapor blankets, interfacial waviness, and residual liquid sub-layer, all of which agree well with experiment.  Vapor velocity is shown to increase appreciably along the heated length because of increased void fraction, while liquid velocity experiences large fluctuations.  Non-equilibrium effects are accentuated with increasing mass velocity, contributing minor deviations of fluid temperature from simulations compared to those predicted by the analytical method.  Predicted wall temperature is fairly uniform in the middle of the heated length but increases in the entrance region, due to sensible heat transfer in the subcooled liquid, and decreases toward the exit, mostly because of flow acceleration resulting from increased void fraction."

Custom thin, flexible polyimide printed circuit boards (PCBs) were designed and procured for fabrication of test specimens. A custom interface PCB was designed and fabricated to monitor the newly developed damage detection test specimens. Test specimens were fabricated using the novel flexible circuitry that were either fully or partially encapsulated. The fully encapsulated specimens were used to demonstrate embedded damage detection concepts and the partially encapsulated specimens were used to demonstrate surface-mounted (laminate) damage detection concepts. The new composite damage detection test specimens were tested and evaluated to determine if the novel damage detection sensory panels could withstand low-cycle threshold fatigue loading per a modified version of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 7264 for up to 50 cycles without void formation. The data for multiple sensory panels indicates that the newly fabricated sensory panels are robust and do indeed withstand three-point bend flexural loading for more than 50 cycles. Additionally, testing was performed to determine if damage could be detected in damage detection test specimens subjected to failure using a 3-point bend test per a modified version of ASTM D 7264. Again, multiple sensory panels (both fully and partially encapsulated) showed the ability to detect damage to specimens subjected to failure per a modified version of ASTM D 7264. Additionally, a novel concept for tracking and monitoring of cracking (and potentially delamination) in composites was designed and developed that utilizes painted-on conductors."

This mysterious part of the gamma-ray sky is perhaps one of the largest unknowns in current astronomical pursuits, and as such has been probed extensively by various techniques at various frequencies. Radio frequencies have been perhaps one of the most fruitful, producing a large fraction of the identied and associated Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and pulsars noted in each update of the point source catalogs.

parameters in the atmosphere/ionosphere during the M7.8 and M7.3 earthquakes in
Nepal, namely: 1) outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA); 2)
GPS/TEC; 3) the very-low-frequency (VLF/LF) signals at the receiving stations in Bishkek
(Kyrgyzstan) and Varanasi (India); 4) Radon observations; 5) Atmospheric chemical
potential from assimilation models; and; 6) Air Temperature from NOAA ground
stations. We found that in mid-March 2015, there was a rapid increase in the radiation
from the atmosphere observed by satellites. This anomaly was located close to the future
M7.8 epicenter and reached a maximum on April 21–22. The GPS/TEC data analysis
indicated an increase and variation in electron density, reaching a maximum value during
April 22–24. A strong negative TEC anomaly in the crest of EIA (Equatorial Ionospheric
Anomaly) occurred on April 21, and a strong positive anomaly was recorded on April 24,
2015. The behavior of VLF-LF waves along NWC-Bishkek and JJY-Varanasi paths has
shown abnormal behavior during April 21–23, several days before the first, stronger
earthquake. Our continuous satellite OLR analysis revealed this new strong anomaly on
May 3, which was why we anticipated another major event in the area. On May 12, 2015,
an M7.3 earthquake occurred. Our results show coherence between the appearance of
these pre-earthquake transient’s effects in the atmosphere and ionosphere (with a short
time-lag, from hours up to a few days) and the occurrence of the 2015 M7.8 and M7.3
events. The spatial characteristics of the pre-earthquake anomalies were associated with a
large area but inside the preparation region estimated by Dobrovolsky-Bowman. The preearthquake
nature of the signals in the atmosphere and ionosphere was revealed by
simultaneous analysis of satellite, GPS/TEC, and VLF/LF and suggest that they follow a

To study this regime, we approximate the spacetime metric of close orbiting black holes bysuperimposing two boosted Kerr-Schild terms.  After demonstrating the quality of this approximation,we carry out very long-term general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the circumbinarydisk.  We consider black holes with spin dimensionless parameters of magnitude 0.9,  in one simula-tion parallel to the orbital angular momentum of the binary, but in another anti-parallel.  These arecontrasted with spinless simulations.  We find that, for a fixed surface mass density in the inner cir-cumbinary disk, aligned spins of this magnitude approximately reduce the mass accretion rate by 14%and counter-aligned spins increase it by 45%, leaving many other disk properties unchanged."

Part I: Theory and Tests on Simulated Data.,"The Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) is an airborne along-track scanner measuring the polarized and total reflectances in 9 spectral channels. The RSP was a prototype for the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS) launched on-board the NASA Glory satellite. Currently the retrieval algorithms developed for the RSP are being adopted for the measurements of the space-borne polarimeters on the upcoming NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud Ocean Ecosystem (PACE)satellite mission. The RSP’s uniquely high angular resolution coupled with the high frequency of measurements allows for characterization of liquid water cloud droplet sizes using the polarized rainbow structure. It also provides geometric constraints on the cumulus cloud’s 2D cross section yielding the cloud’s geometric shape estimates. In this study we further build on the latter technique to develop a new tomographic approach to retrieval of cloud internal structure from remote sensing measurements. While tomography in the strict definition is a technique based on active measurements yielding a tomogram (directional optical thickness as a function of angle and offset of the view ray), we developed a “semi-tomographic” approach in which tomogram of the cloud is estimated from passive observations instead of being measured directly. This tomogram is then converted into 2D spatial distribution of the extinction coefficient using inverse Radon transform (filtered back projection) which is the standard tomographic procedure used e.g., in medical CT scans. This algorithm is computationally inexpensive compared to techniques relying on highly-multi-dimensional least-square fitting; it does not require iterative 3D RT simulations. The resulting extinction distribution is defined up to an unknown constant factor, so we discuss the ways to calibrate it using additional independent measurements. In the next step we use the profile of the droplet size distribution parameters from the cloud’s side (derived by fitting the polarized rainbows) to convert the 2D extinction distribution into that of the droplet number concentration. We illustrate and validate the proposed technique using 3D-RT-simulatedRSP observations of a LES-generated Cu cloud. Quantitative comparisons between the retrieved and the original optical and microphysical parameters are presented."

However, determining the energetics of these outflows is difficult with spatially unresolved observations that are subject to strong global selection effects. We present part of an ongoing study using Hubble Space Telescope and Apache Point Observatory spectroscopy and imaging to derive spatially resolved mass outflow rates and energetics for narrow-line region outflows in nearby AGN that are based on multi-component photoionization models to account for spatial variations in gas ionization, density, abundances, and dust content. This expanded analysis adds Mrk 3, Mrk 78, and NGC 1068, doubling our earlier sample. We find that the outflows contain total ionized gas masses of M ≈ 10(exp 5.5)-10(exp 7.5) M⨀ and reach peak velocities of v ≈ 800-2000 km s(exp -1). The outflows reach maximum mass outflow rates of M(sub OUT) ≈ 3-12 M⨀ yr(exp -1) and encompass total kinetic energies of E ≈ 10(exp 54)-10(exp 56) erg. The outflows extend to radial distances of r ≈ 0.1-3 kpc from the nucleus, with the gas masses, outflow energetics, and radial extents positively correlated with AGN luminosity. The outflow rates are consistent with in situ ionization and acceleration where gas is radiatively driven at multiple radii. These radial variations indicate that spatially resolved observations are essential for localizing AGN feedback and determining the most accurate outflow parameters."

Here, harmonic analysis was applied to four 0.25° satellite products and two 1° in situ products between 2016 and 2018 to determine seasonal harmonic patterns. The 0.25° World Ocean Atlas (WOA) version 2018 was referenced to help assess the harmonic patterns from a long-term perspective based on the 3-year period. The results show that annual harmonic is the most characteristic signal of the seasonal cycle, and semiannual harmonic is important in regions influenced by monsoon and major rivers. The percentage of the observed variance that can be explained by harmonic modes varies with products, with values ranging between 50% and 72% for annual harmonic and between 15% and 19% for semiannual harmonic. The large spread in the explained variance by the annual harmonic reflects the large disparity in nonseasonal variance (or noise) in the different products. Satellite products are capable of capturing sharp SSS features on meso- and frontal scales and the patterns agree well with the WOA 2018. These products are, however, subject to the impacts of radiometric noises and are algorithm dependent. The coarser-resolution in situ products may underrepresent the full range of high-frequency small scale SSS variability when data record is short, which may have enlarged the explained SSS variance by the annual harmonic."

Although there are now only a few commonly used data file formats, the diversity in mechanisms for automated access to and aggregation of such data holdings can make analysis that requires intercomparison of data from multiple data providers difficult. The Heliophysics Application Programmer's Interface (HAPI) is a recently developed standard for accessing distributed time series data to increase interoperability. The HAPI specification is based on the common elements of existing data services, and it standardizes the two main parts of a data service: the request interface and the response data structures. The interface is based on the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) or RESTful architecture style, and the HAPI specification defines five required REST endpoints. Data are returned via a streaming format that hides file boundaries; the metadata is detailed enough for the content to be scientifically useful, e.g., plotted with appropriate axes layout, units, and labels. Multiple mature HAPI-related open-source projects offer server-side implementation tools and client-side libraries for reading HAPI data in multiple languages (IDL, Java, MATLAB, and Python). Multiple data providers in the US and Europe have added HAPI access alongside their existing interfaces. Based on this experience, data can be served via HAPI with little or no information loss compared to similar existing web interfaces. Finally, HAPI has been recommended as a COSPAR standard for time series data delivery."

The Mars Science Laboratory Rover Environmental Monitoring Station pressure sensor dataset is now the longest duration record of surface pressure on Mars.  We use the first 2580 martian sols, nearly 4 Mars years,of measurements to identify atmospheric pressure waves with periods of tens of minutes to hours using wavelet analysis on residual pressure after the tidal harmonics are removed.  We find these waves have a clear diurnal cycle with strongest activity in the early morning and late evening and a seasonal cycle with the strongest waves in the second half of the martian year (Ls= 180-360°).  The strongest such waves of the entire mission occurred during the Mars Year 34 global dust storm.  Comparable atmospheric waves are identified using atmospheric modeling with the MarsWRF general circulation model in a “nested” high spatial resolution mode.  With the support of the modeling, we find these waves best fit the expected properties of inertia-gravity waves with horizontal wavelengths of O(100s) of km.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY

Measuring air pressure from the surface of Mars has revealed a wide variety of atmospheric phenomena.  The Curiosity rover's record or surface air pressure is now the longest yet made on Mars.We use the first ~8 years of Curiosity's pressure observations to look for atmospheric waves with periods of tens of minutes to hours.  We find these waves have a clear pattern in their daily behavior with the strongest activity in the early morning and late evening and a seasonal cycle with the strongest waves in the second half of the martian year (Northern hemisphere fall and winter).  The strongest such waves occurred in 2018 during a global dust storm.  We find comparable waves in atmospheric modeling.  With the support of modeling, we find these waves best fit the expected properties of buoyancy waves forced by airflow over topography with horizontal wavelengths of 100-1000 km."

Changes in 2020 were strongly dependent on the choice of background period since 2005 and whether trends in atmospheric composition were accounted for. Over central east China during the 23 January–8 April lockdown window, CO in 2020 was between 3 % and 12 % lower than average depending on the background period. The 2020 CO was not consistently less than expected from trends beginning between 2005 and 2016 and ending in 2019 but was 3 %–4 % lower than the background mean during the 2017–2019 period when CO changes had flattened. Similarly for AOD, 2020 was between 14 % and 30 % lower than averages beginning in 2005 and 14 %–17 % lower compared to different background means beginning in 2016. NO2 in 2020 was between 30 % and 43 % lower than the mean over different background periods and between 17 % and 33 % lower than what would be expected for trends beginning later than 2011. Relative to the 2016–2019 period when NO2 had flattened, 2020 was 30 %–33 % lower. Over southern China, 2020 NO2 was between 23 % and 27 % lower than different background means beginning in 2013, the beginning of a period of persistently lower NO2. CO over southern China was significantly higher in 2020 than what would be expected, which we suggest was partly because of an active fire season in neighboring countries. Over central east and southern China, 2020 SO2 was higher than expected, but this depended strongly on how daily regional values were calculated from individual retrievals and reflects background values approaching the retrieval detection limit. Future work over China, or other regions, needs to take into account the sensitivity of differences in 2020 to different background periods and trends in order to separate the effects of COVID-19 on air quality from previously occurring changes or from variability in other sources."

This paper investigates the effects of snow-cover depth and cloud liquid water content on microwave signatures of terrestrial snowfall using reanalysis data and multi-annual observations by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core satellite with particular emphasis on the 89 and 166 GHz channels. It is found that over shallow snow cover (snow water equivalent (SWE) ≤100 kg/sq. m) and low values of cloud liquid water path (LWP 100–150 g/sq. m), the scattering of light snowfall (intensities ≤0.5 mm/ h) is detectable only at frequency 166 GHz, while for higher snowfall rates, the signal can also be detected at 89 GHz. However, when SWE exceeds 200 kg/sq. m and the LWP is greater than 100–150 g/sq. m, the emission from the increased liquid water content in snowing clouds becomes the only surrogate microwave signal of snowfall that is stronger at frequency 89 than 166 GHz. The results also reveal that over high latitudes above 60°N where the SWE is greater than 200 kg/sq. m and LWP is lower than 100–150 g/sq. m, the snowfall microwave signal could not be detected with GPM without considering a priori data about SWE and LWP.

Satellite remote-sensing technology and air quality models can provide pollution data on a global scale, necessary for riskcommunication efforts in regions without ground-based monitoring networks. Several large centers, including NASA, produce global pollution forecasts that may be used alongside air quality indices to communicate local, daily risk information to the public. Here we present a health-based, globally applicable air quality index developed specifically to reflect the respiratory health risks among children exposed to elevated outdoor air pollution. Additive, excess-risk air quality indices were developed using 51 different coefficients derived from time-series health studies evaluating the impacts of ambient fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone on children's respiratory morbidity outcomes. A total of four indices were created which varied based on whether or not the underlying studies controlled for co-pollutants and in the adjustment of excess risks of individual pollutants. Combined with historical estimates of air pollution provided globally at a 25x25 km2 spatial resolution from the NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS-CF) model, each of these indices were examined in a global sample of 664 small and 140 large cities for study year 2017. Adjusted indices presented the most normal distributions of locally-scaled index values, which has been shown to improve associations with health risks, while indices based on coefficients controlling for co-pollutants had little effect on index performance. We provide the steps and resources need to apply our final adjusted index at the local level using freely-available forecasting data from the GEOS-CF model, which can provide risk communication information for cities around the world to better inform individual behavior modification to best protect children's respiratory health."

In an effort to more rigorously constrain ice growth processes (e.g., vapor deposition) with observations of natural clouds, a novel framework is developed to compare simulated and observed radar measurements, coupling a bulk adaptive-habit model of vapor growth to a polarimetric radar forward model. Bayesian inference on key microphysical model parameters is then used, via a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, to estimate the probability distribution of the model parameters. The statistical formalism of this method allows for robust estimates of the optimal parameter values, along with (non-Gaussian) estimates of their uncertainty. To demonstrate this framework, observations from Department of Energy radars in the Arctic during a case of pristine ice precipitation are used to constrain vapor deposition parameters in the adaptive habit model. The resulting parameter probability distributions provide physically plausible changes in ice particle density and aspect ratio during growth. A lack of direct constraint on the number concentration produces a range of possible mean particle sizes, with the mean size inversely correlated to number concentration. Consistency is found between the estimated inherent growth ratio and independent laboratory measurements, increasing confidence in the parameter PDFs and demonstrating the effectiveness of the radar measurements in constraining the parameters. The combined Doppler and polarimetric observations produce the highest-confidence estimates of the parameter PDFs, with the Doppler measurements providing a stronger constraint for this case."

The search explores distances from 300 au to 2000 au and velocities up to 6\farcm3 per year, depending on the distance (r). For a 5 Earth-mass Planet 9 the detection limit varies from 325 au to 625 au, depending on the sky location. For a 10 Earth-mass planet the corresponding range is 425 au to 775 au. The predicted aphelion and most likely location of the planet corresponds to the shallower end of these ranges. The search covers the whole 18,000 square degrees of the ACT survey. No significant detections are found, which is used to place limits on the millimeter-wave flux density of Planet 9 over much of its orbit. Overall we eliminate roughly 17% and 9% of the parameter space for a 5 and 10 Earth-mass Planet 9, respectively. These bounds approach those of a recent INPOP19a ephemeris-based analysis, but do not exceed it. We also provide a list of the 10 strongest candidates from the search for possible follow-up. More generally, we exclude (at 95% confidence) the presence of an unknown solar system object within our survey area brighter than 4–12 mJy (depending on position) at 150 GHz with current distance 300 au < r < 600 au and heliocentric angular velocity 1\farcm5 per yr < v x (500au/r) < 2\farcs3 per yr, corresponding to low-to-moderate eccentricities. These limits worsen gradually beyond 600 au, reaching 5–15 mJy by 1500 au."

These measurements of HCN, CS, CH3OH, H2CO, and HNC (along with continuum emission from dust) probed the inner coma of C/2015 ER61, revealing asymmetric outgassing and discerning parent from daughter/distributed source species. This work presents spectrally integrated flux maps, autocorrelation spectra, production rates, and parent scale lengths for each molecule and a stringent upper limit for CO. HCN is consistent with direct nucleus release in C/2015 ER61, whereas CS, H2CO, HNC, and potentially CH3OH are associated with distributed sources in the coma. Adopt- ing a Haser model, parent scale lengths determined for H2CO (Lp ∼ 2200 km) and HNC (Lp ∼ 3300 km) are consistent with previous work in comets, whereas significant extended source production (Lp ∼ 2000 km) is indicated for CS, suggesting production from an unknown parent in the coma. The continuum presents a point-source distribution with a flux density implying an excessively large nucleus, inconsistent with other estimates of the nucleus size. It is best explained by the thermal emission of slowly moving outburst ejectas, with total mass 5–8 × 1010 kg. These results demonstrate the power of the ACA for revealing the abundances, spatial distributions, and locations of molecular production for volatiles in moderately bright comets such as C/2015 ER61."

A key uncertainty is how forests will respond to
(resistance) and recover from (resilience) rising levels of disturbance of varying intensities. This
knowledge gap can optimally be addressed by integrating manipulative field experiments with
ecophysiological modeling. We used the Ecosystem Demography-2.2 (ED-2.2) model to project
carbon fluxes for a northern temperate deciduous forest subjected to a real-world disturbance
severity manipulation experiment. ED-2.2 was run for 150 years, starting from near bare ground
in 1900 (approximating the clear-cut conditions at the time), and subjected to three disturbance
treatments under an ensemble of climate conditions. Both disturbance severity and climate
strongly affected carbon fluxes such as gross primary production (GPP), and interacted with one
another. We then calculated resistance and resilience, two dimensions of ecosystem stability.
Modeled GPP exhibited a two-fold decrease in mean resistance across disturbance severities of
45%, 65%, and 85% mortality; conversely, resilience increased by a factor of two with
increasing disturbance severity. This pattern held for net primary production and net ecosystem
production, indicating a trade-off in which greater initial declines were followed by faster
recovery. Notably, however, heterotrophic respiration responded more slowly to disturbance, and
its highly variable response was affected by different drivers. This work provides insight into
how future conditions might affect the functional stability of mature forests in this region under
ongoing climate change and changing disturbance regimes."

Transiting sub-Neptune-type planets, with radii approximately between 2 and 4R⊕, are of particular interest as their study allows us to gain insight into the formation and evolution of a class of planets that are not found in our Solar System. Aims. We exploit the extreme radial velocity (RV) precision of the ultra-stable echelle spectrograph ESPRESSO on the VLT to unveil the physical properties of the transiting sub-Neptune TOI-130 b, uncovered by the TESS mission orbiting the nearby, bright, late F-typestar HD 5278 (TOI-130) with a period of Pb=14.3 days. Methods. We used 43 ESPRESSO high-resolution spectra and broad-band photometry information to derive accurate stellar atmospheric and physical parameters of HD 5278. We exploited the TESS light curve and spectroscopic diagnostics to gauge the impact of stellar activity on the ESPRESSO RVs. We performed separate as well as joint analyses of the TESS photometry and the ESPRESSORVs using fully Bayesian frameworks to determine the system parameters. Results. Based on the ESPRESSO spectra, the updated stellar parameters of HD 5278 are Teff=6203±64K, logg=4.50±0.11dex, [Fe/H] =−0.12±0.04dex,M?=1.126+0.036−0.035M,  and R?=1.194+0.017−0.016R. We determine HD  5278 b’s mass and radius to be Mb=7.8+1.5−1.4M⊕ and Rb=2.45±0.05R⊕. The derived mean density, %b=2.9+0.6−0.5g cm−3, is consistent with the bulk composition of a sub-Neptune with a substantial (∼30%) water mass fraction and with a gas envelope comprising ∼17% of the measured radius. Given the host brightness and irradiation levels, HD 5278 b is one of the best targets orbiting G-F primaries for follow-up atmospheric characterization measurements with HST and JWST. We discover a second, non-transiting companion in the system, with a period of Pc=40.87+0.18−0.17days and a minimum mass of Mcsinic=18.4+1.8−1.9M⊕. We study emerging trends in parameters space (e.g., mass, radius, stellar insolation, and mean density) of the growing population of transiting sub-Neptunes, and provide statistical evidence for a low occurrence of close-in,10−15M⊕companions around G-F primaries withTeff&5500K."

We assume the landing is near dawn within Lacus Mortis at 45oN. We consider a set of water desorption scenarios especially focusing on the water-surface desorption activation energy that can possess a distribution of energy states. Our initial simulation starts with a deposition surface having 1020 water molecules per square meter in a 2 km × 2 km region where 90% of the water is retained by weak water-water sorption interactions and 10% are bound by water-regolith sorption interactions. We find that the loosely bound water molecules in water-water interactions quickly desorb within hours after landing. However, water molecules bound to surface sites having a desorption activation greater than 0.7 eV were found to be retained until the source region rotated to later local times (i.e., surface temperature becomes relatively high). We found such time-delayed desorption leads to a tenuous but lingering exosphere emitted from the lander plume deposit region for many 10's of hours after landing. We also adjusted the initial condition by considering different landing local times and considered a case where 100% of the water is bound by water-regolith interactions (mimicking a porous regolith)."

However, whether and to what extent photoperiod (i.e., daylength) affects the phenological advancement is unclear, leading to large uncertainties in projecting future phenological changes. Here we examined the photoperiod effect on spring phenology at a regional scale using in situ observation of six deciduous tree species from the Pan European Phenological Network during 1980-2016. We disentangled the photoperiod effect from the temperature effect (i.e., forcing and chilling) by utilizing the unique topography of the northern Alps of Europe (i.e., varying daylength but uniform temperature distribution across latitudes) and examining phenological changes across latitudes. We found prominent photoperiod-induced shifts in spring leaf-out across latitudes (up to 1.7 daysper latitudinal degree). Photoperiod regulates spring phenology by delaying early leaf-out and advancing late leaf-out caused by temperature variations. Based on these findings, we proposed two phenological models that consider the photoperiod effect through different mechanisms and compared them with a chilling model. We found that photoperiod regulation would slow down the advance in spring leaf-out under projected climate warming and thus mitigate the increasing frost risk in spring that deciduous forests will face in the future. Our findings identify photoperiod as a critical but understudied factor influencing spring phenology, suggesting that the responses of terrestrial ecosystem processes to climate warming are likely to be overestimated without adequately considering the photoperiod effect."

The goal is to better understand aerosol behaviors and to help better represent the radiative effects of aerosols on climate. For this, the paper presents a statistical analysis of a multi-month global dataset that combines data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) satellite instruments with data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) global reanalysis. Among other findings, the results reveal that near-cloud enhancements in lidar backscatter (closely related to aerosol optical depth) are larger (1) over land than ocean by 35%, (2) near optically thicker clouds by substantial amounts, (3) for sea salt than for other aerosol types, with the difference from dust reaching 50%. Finally, the study found that mean lidar backscatter is higher near clouds not because of large-scale variations in meteorological conditions, but because of local processes associated with individual clouds. The results help improve our understanding of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions and our ability to represent them in climate models and other atmospheric models"

This study evaluates the capability of a sun/sky photometer to perform additional surface reflectance observations. The ground station of Toulouse, France, which belongs to the AERONET sun/sky photometer network, is used for this feasibility study. The experiment was conducted for a 5-year period (between 2016 and 2020). The sun/sky photometer was mounted on a metallic structure at a height of 2.5 m, and the acquisition software was adapted to add a periodical (every hour) ground-observation scenario with the sun/sky photometer observing the surface instead of being inactive. Evaluation is performed by using a classical metric characterizing the vegetation health: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using as reference the satellite NDVI derived from a Sentinel-2 (S2) sensor at 10 × 10 m resolution. Comparison for the 5-year period showed good agreement between the S2 and sun/sky photometer NDVIs (i.e., bias = 0.004, RMSD = 0.082, and R = 0.882 for a mean value of S2A NDVI around 0.6). Discrepancies could have been due to spatial-representativeness issues (of the ground measurement compared to S2), the differences between spectral bands, and the quality of the atmospheric correction applied on S2 data (accuracy of the sun/sky photometer instrument was better than 0.1%). However, the accuracy of the atmospheric correction applied on S2 data in this station appeared to be of good quality, and no dependence on the presence of aerosols was observed. This first analysis of the potential of the CIMEL CE318 sun/sky photometer to monitor the surface is encouraging. Further analyses need to be carried out to estimate the potential in different AERONET stations. The occasional rerouting of AERONET stations could lead to a complementary network of surface reflectance observations. This would require an update of the software, and eventual adaptations of the measurement platforms to the station environments. The additional cost, based on the existing AERONET network, would be quite limited. These new surface measurements would be interesting for measurements of vegetation health (monitoring of NDVI, and also of other vegetation indices such as the leaf area and chlorophyll indices), for validation and calibration exercise purposes, and possibly to refine various scientific algorithms (i.e., algorithms dedicated to cloud detection or the AERONET aerosol retrieval algorithm itself). CIMEL is ready to include the ground scenario used in this study in all new sun/sky photometers."

First, the control volume model of a strain-gage balance and the concepts of load state, load space, and output space are introduced. These important abstractions provide a better understanding of fundamental characteristics of different balance load prediction approaches. Then, the description of strain-gage balance data and the definition of the primary gage sensitivity is discussed. Afterwards, basic elements of the calibration of a typical six-component balance are reviewed. Two fundamentally different balance load prediction methods, the processing of check loads, and related topics are also discussed. Three real-world balance data examples are reviewed  in great detail to illustrate typical analysis results for a variety of strain-gage balance designs. Finally, important observations are summarized and recommendations are provided. Additional information and detailed mathematical derivations can be found in the appendices of the document. They include the following topics: balance terminology, definitions of important statistical metrics, balance axis system conventions, balance load transformations, the combined load diagram, electrical output format options, bi-directional gage output characteristics, determination of the natural zeros, derivation of two balance load prediction methods, description of two tare load iteration algorithms, modeling of balance temperature effects, basics of three-component moment balances, definition of the percent contribution, detection of linear and near-linear dependencies in balance calibration data, a regression model term selection algorithm, and other related topics."

and Chemicals (SHERLOC) is a robotic arm-mounted instrument on NASA’s Perseverance
rover. SHERLOC has two primary boresights. The Spectroscopy boresight generates
spatially resolved chemical maps using fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy coupled to
microscopic images (10.1 μm/pixel). The second boresight is a Wide Angle Topographic
Sensor for Operations and eNgineering (WATSON); a copy of the Mars Science Laboratory
(MSL) Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) that obtains color images from microscopic
scales (∼13 μm/pixel) to infinity. SHERLOC Spectroscopy focuses a 40 μs pulsed deep UV
neon-copper laser (248.6 nm), to a ∼100 μm spot on a target at a working distance of ∼48
mm. Fluorescence emissions from organics, and Raman scattered photons from organics
and minerals, are spectrally resolved with a single diffractive grating spectrograph with a
spectral range of 250 to ∼370 nm. Because the fluorescence and Raman regions are naturally
separated with deep UV excitation (<250 nm), the Raman region ∼ 800 – 4000 cm−1
(250 to 273 nm) and the fluorescence region (274 to ∼370 nm) are acquired simultaneously
without time gating or additional mechanisms. SHERLOC science begins by using an Autofocus
Context Imager (ACI) to obtain target focus and acquire 10.1 μm/pixel greyscale
images. Chemical maps of organic and mineral signatures are acquired by the orchestration
of an internal scanning mirror that moves the focused laser spot across discrete points on
the target surface where spectra are captured on the spectrometer detector. ACI images and
chemical maps (< 100 μm/mapping pixel) will enable the first Mars in situ view of the spatial
distribution and interaction between organics, minerals, and chemicals important to the
assessment of potential biogenicity (containing CHNOPS). Single robotic arm placement
chemical maps can cover areas up to 7x7 mm in area and, with the < 10 min acquisition
time per map, larger mosaics are possible with arm movements. This microscopic view of
the organic geochemistry of a target at the Perseverance field site, when combined with
the other instruments, such as Mastcam-Z, PIXL, and SuperCam, will enable unprecedented
analysis of geological materials for both scientific research and determination of which samples
to collect and cache for Mars sample return."

A basin-scale flood monitoring system requires an effective observation platform that offers extensive ground coverage of flood conditions, low latency, and high spatiotemporal resolution. While satellite imagery offers substantial spatial flood extent in detail due to its high spatial resolution, the coarse temporal resolution and cloud obstruction limit its near real-time application. Daily soil moisture data derived from satellite sensors at a scale of a few km can be used to monitor extreme wet surface conditions arising in flood occurrences. This study analyses the flood detection capabilities of several sources of soil moisture information, including the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E), the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on MetOp, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM). In addition to soil moisture, the analysis includes measurements of surface reflectance from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), precipitation measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and terrestrial water storage estimates from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) as proxies for flood inundations. The analysis was conducted over the Chao Phraya River Basin (CPB) in Thailand, where the Great Flood of 2011 led to one of the most significant economic losses in the country's history. Satellite-derived soil moisture exhibits a stronger correlation with the flood inundations than the precipitation, model-derived soil moisture, and terrestrial water storage data. SMOS soil moisture observation agrees best with the MODIS-derived flood extent/occurrence, both in terms of spatial distribution and timing, and providing approximated flood lead-time of one week or longer. A neural network constructed from SMOS and MODIS data is used to predict flood intensity/occurrence (given soil moisture input) with a predicted time window from eight days to thirty-two days. The short-term prediction (e.g., eight days) achieves the highest accuracy with an averaged recovery rate of approximately 60% (correlation coefficient). This study's results suggest a potential application of satellite soil moisture data in assisting flood monitoring and warning systems."

Combining our measurements of H I 21 cm emission with Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based optical and near-infrared images allows multiple distance measurements for 19 galaxies and single measurements for the remaining 5. Separation of the nucleus from its host galaxy via surface brightness decomposition yields galaxy-only luminosities, thus allowing measurements of the distance moduli free of contamination from the AGNs. For 14 AGN hosts, these are the first reported distances independent of redshift, and hence independent of peculiar velocities. For the remaining galaxies, we show good agreement between our distances and those previously reported from surface brightness fluctuations and Cepheids. We also determine the total galaxy mass enclosed within the estimated H I radius, which when compared to the baryonic content allows for constraints on the dark matter masses. We find a typical mass fraction of M(sub DM)/M(sub DYN) = 62%, and find significant correlations between M(sub BH)–M(sub DYN) and M(sub BH)–M(sub DM). Finally, we scale our galaxy radii based on estimated relationships between visible and halo radii and assume a flat rotation curve out to the halo radius to approximate M(sub HALO). Over the range of M(sub BH) and M(sub HALO) in this sample, we find good agreement with observationally constrained relationships between M(sub BH) and M(sub HALO) and with hydrodynamical simulations."

However, these observations are subject to substantial uncertainty due to the complex radiative properties of snow and from interference in forested areas. Physical radiative transfer models can be leveraged to improve the fidelity of these observations and as a data-assimilation tool. In this article, the Dense Media Radiative Transfer model with Multiple Layers (DMRT-ML) is used to simulate snow brightness temperatures from data collected from snow pits excavated during a two-day-long field study performed a temperate forest in the Northeast United States. The simulations are evaluated against surface-based radiometer observations collected at the snow pits. The DMRT-ML is configured with varying complexity to determine the snowpack characteristics most essential toward simulating brightness temperature within a temperate forest with complicated snow stratigraphy. In general, the single-layer configurations were not sufficiently complex to accurately simulate snow brightness temperature without significant tuning. The most accurate simulation was a two-layer configuration with a prescribed ice layer separating the snow layers. This simulation had a root-mean-square error <;15 K for the 37-GHz frequency. More complicated snowpack stratigraphy configurations did not substantively improve the results over the two-layer model configuration. The DMRT-ML was also used to examine differences between redundant datasets of density and grain size. It was determined that similar snow data collection and radiative transfer model configuration techniques are critical to ensure cross-study comparability."

Therefore, an accurate representation of FT is valuable to adequately monitor and model these processes. In this study, we assess the relationship between satellite-based FT products and modeled surface and soil temperatures over North America. In addition, hourly land surface temperature (LST) from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system is also compared to FT classifications. Utilizing the higher spatial resolution temperatures (5 km), we assess subgrid-scale variability and its relationship to coarser microwave FT classifications (>25 km). We also examine product agreement and subpixel characteristics across the land cover, climate, and topography. FT classifications are shown to vary widely depending on these variables, leading to an ambiguous definition of frozen and thawed states. Our results suggest that current products can characterize FT transitions with consistent subfreezing surface characteristics in far northern regions (>50 °N). However, uncertainty associated with FT classifications is shown to increase considerably as latitude decreases. Our results also suggest that fractional FT products, utilizing data inputs, such as LST, would provide a considerable improvement in mountainous regions with high intergrid cell heterogeneity, in regions characterized by ephemeral FT events (i.e., regions <40 °N), as well as during freeze and thaw onset periods. This study also provides insight to improving the representation of surface FT state by providing a clearer definition of the subpixel scale temperature characteristics that govern existing frozen classifications."

Generating realistic simulations of photometric SN surveys constitutes anessential step for training and testing photometric classification algorithms, and for correcting biases introduced by selectioneffects and contamination arising from core-collapse SNe in the photometric SN Ia samples. We use published SN time-seriesspectrophotometric templates, rates, luminosity functions, and empirical relationships between SNe and their host galaxies toconstruct a framework for simulating photometric SN surveys. We present this framework in the context of the Dark EnergySurvey (DES) 5-yr photometric SN sample, comparing our simulations of DES with the observed DES transient populations.We  demonstrate  excellent  agreement  in  many  distributions,  including  Hubble  residuals,  between  our  simulations  and  data.We estimate the core collapse fraction expected in the DES SN sample after selection requirements are applied and beforephotometric classification. After testing different modelling choices and astrophysical assumptions underlying our simulation,we find that the predicted contamination varies from 7.2 to 11.7 per cent, with an average of 8.8 per cent and an r.m.s. of 1.1 percent. Our simulations are the first to reproduce the observed photometric SN and host galaxy properties in high-redshift surveyswithout fine-tuning the input parameters. The simulation methods presented here will be a critical component of the cosmologyanalysis of the DES photometric SN Ia sample: correcting for biases arising from contamination, and evaluating the associatedsystematic uncertainty."

We find that the source evolves through the soft-intermediate, high-soft, hard-intermediate, and low-hard states during the outburst. No evidence of quasi-periodic oscillations is found in the power-density spectra of the source. Weak variability with fraction alarms amplitude<5 per cent is found in the softer spectral states. In the hard-intermediate and hard states, high variability with the fractional rms amplitude of>20 per cent is observed. The 0.7–10 keV spectra with NICER are studied with a combined disc-black-body and nth comp model along with the interstellar absorption. The temperature of the disc is estimated to be 0.6 keV in the rising phase and decreased slowly to 0.1 keV in the declining phase. The disc component was not detectable or absent during the low-hard state. From the state-transition luminosity and the inner edge of the accretion flow, we estimate the mass of the black hole to be in the range of 5–12 M, assuming the source distance of d<10 kpc."

Using four spacecraft in a tetrahedron shape, it could measure, for the first time, 3D quantities such as electrical currents, plasma gradients or divergence of the electron pressure tensor and 3D structures such as boundaries, surface waves or vortices. Launched in pairs in July and August 2000, on two Soyuz rockets from Baikonur, the four spacecraft have been collecting data continuously for more than 20 years. The mission faced many challenges during the years of operations as some spacecraft subsystems had a lifetime of a few years beyond the initial two-year mission. The major one was to operate without functioning batteries and to successfully pass short and long eclipses, up to 3 h long, without damaging the on-board computers and transmitters and without freezing the fuel. More than 1,000 eclipses have been successfully passed since 2010 using a specially made procedure which switches off the complete spacecraft before entering into eclipse and switches it on when the Sun is again illuminating the solar panels. During 20 years, many discoveries and science results have been published in more than 2,700 scientific papers. A few highlights are presented here, focusing on how varying the spacecraft separation was essential to achieve the science goals of the mission. The Cluster Science Data System and the Cluster archive allows public access to all science data as well as spacecraft ancillary data."

We evaluate the impact of prior knowledge of planet existence and orbital parameters on yield for four mission concept architectures: HabEx 4m telescope with hybrid starshade and coronagraph, HabEx4m telescope with starshade only, HabEx 4m telescope with coronagraph only, and LUVOIR B8m telescope with coronagraph only. We use perfect prior knowledge to establish an upperbound on yield and use partial prior knowledge from a potential future extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) instrument with3cm∕ssensitivity. We detail a modeling framework that per-forms dynamically responsive observation scheduling with realistic mission constraints. We evaluate exo-Earth yields against three metrics of spectral characterization for the four mission architectures and three levels of prior knowledge (none, partial, and perfect). The EPRV pro-vided prior knowledge increases yields by∼30%and accelerates by a factor of 3 to 6 the time to achieve half of the yield of the mission. Prior knowledge makes all the mission architectures more nimble and powerful, and most especially starshade-based architectures. With prior knowledge, a small telescope with a starshade can achieve comparable yield to a larger telescope with a coronagraph."

These large-scale structures vary temporally and spatially, both in latitude and with radial distance. The additions of Parker Solar Probe(PSP) and Solar Orbiter have allowed for investigations into the radial evolution of these structures over a wide range of heliocentric distances for the first time since the Helios era. To better enable investigations of SIRs and CIRs within the inner heliosphere, we have developed a living catalog of SIR and CIR observations by Parker Solar Probe with corresponding observations by STEREO-A as well as ACE and Wind at 1 au. The methodology used for the identification of events and the generation of this catalog, the initial catalog of PSP observations spanning orbits one through five along with corresponding 1 au observations, and information on accessing the living catalog for future studies is described. This list of SIR and CIR events from PSP and corresponding observations from other heliophysics missions will enable case studies utilizing unique orbital arrangements, as well as aid in future statistical studies to further understand the properties and evolution of these structures."

However, one aspect that remains to be investigated is the intrinsic IR spectral intensities of solid HCN as opposed to relative band strengths, intrinsic intensities being needed to measure HCN abundances. Here we report measurements of IR absorption coefficients and band strengths, along with supporting refractive indices and densities, of both amorphous and crystalline HCN at two temperatures, one for interstellar work and one more relevant to the outer solar system. Spectra are presented at both temperatures, along with optical constants that can be used in numerical models. Despite widespread and longstanding interest in and investigations of solid HCN, this is the first time that the properties we are reporting have been measured in a single laboratory, avoiding the need for estimates or to combine results from various authors. We find that our measured band strength of ~1 × 1017 cm molecule1 for the CN vibration of HCN, in both amorphous HCN and in an H2O-rich ice, is substantially higher than an earlier estimate. Unless errors of 100% can be tolerated then our new value requires a rescaling of earlier work. Our results shed light on why HCN and other nitriles have been so difficult to identify in the solid state, in contrast to their many detections in the gas phase."

If the smallest inferred ionization parameters correspond to plasma at a few 104 K, then the gas undergoes a transition from being bound to unbound, provided it is further heated to ∼106 K at larger radii. Dannen et al. recently discovered that, under these circumstances, thermally driven wind solutions are unsteady and even show very dense clumps due to thermal instability. To explore the observational consequences of these new wind solutions, we compute line profiles based on the one-dimensional simulations of Dannen et al. We show how the line profiles from even a simple steady-state wind solution depend on the ionization energy (IE) of absorbing ions, which is a reflection of the wind ionization stratification. To organize the diversity of the line shapes, we group them into four categories: weak Gaussians, saturated boxy profiles with and without an extended blue wing, and broad weak profiles. The lines with profiles in the last two categories are produced by ions with the highest IE that probe the fastest regions. Their maximum blueshifts agree with the highest flow velocities in thermally unstable models, both steady-state and clumpy versions. In contrast, the maximum blueshifts of the highest-IE lines in thermally stable models can be less than half of the actual solution velocities. Clumpy solutions can additionally imprint distinguishable absorption troughs at widely separated velocities."

The reduction in population of this species is attributed to loss of low elevation habitat, changing local environmental and climatic conditions, and increased disturbance from backcountry recreation. In response to these changes, this population of sheep employs a unique high-elevation wintering strategy in which they amass large fat stores in the summer and expend as little energy as possible in the winter while foraging on high elevation wind-swept and snow-free areas. For this project, DEVELOP partnered with Grand Teton National Park and used NASA Earth observations including Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data to assess habitat suitability. Landcover change analyzed between 1987 and 2020 indicated shifting trends in grass and forb cover and tree cover. These trends persisted in the 2031 prediction, with grass cover decreasing and tree cover increasing, which translates to a loss of overall favorable habitat for bighorn sheep. Snow cover analyzed between 2001 and 2020 indicated similar unfavorable trends for the sheep with a decrease in barren areas, important for winter foraging. Finally, habitat suitability was modeled for 2020 and predicted to 2031 to determine habitat gains and losses for this species across the landscape. Overall, the results predicted decreases in suitable habitat and indicated that while these sheep are highly adaptable, strategies to manage suitable bighorn habitat may need to be employed rapidly to effectively conserve this species."

In this study, the first and second-order spectral derivatives of aerosol optical depth (AOD) with respect to wavelength are explored to determine the partitions of the major components of aerosols based on the spectral dependence of their particle optical size and complex refractive index. With theoretical simulations from the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) model, AOD spectral derivatives are characterized for collective models of aerosol types, such as mineral dust (DS) particles, biomass-burning (BB) aerosols and anthropogenic pollutants (AP), as well as stretching out to the mixtures among them.  Based on the intrinsic values from normalized spectral derivatives, referenced as the Normalized Derivative Aerosol Index (NDAI), a unique pattern is clearly exhibited for bounding the major aerosol components; in turn, fractions of the total AOD (fAOD) for major aerosol components can be extracted. The subtlety of this NDAI method is examined by using measurements of typical aerosol cases identified carefully by the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun–sky spectroradiometer. The results may be highly practicable for quantifying fAOD among mixed-type aerosols by means of the normalized AOD spectral derivatives."

The fine fraction dominated in northern China and also played a crucial role on the Tibetan Plateau and in southern China and Southeast Asia, whereas the coarse fraction prevailed in Northwest Asia. Furthermore, the fine-mode aerosol on the Tibetan Plateau exhibited its maximum radiative forcing efficiency (110.3  W  m–2)  during  high  concentrations  of  SA  aerosol.  Also,  the  lowest  values  for  both  the  radiative forcing and the radiative forcing efficiency in southern China occurred during summer.

Furthermore, because cheatgrass can quickly dominate disturbed landscapes it has the potential to exacerbate wildfire risk by increasing fuel loads. In 2020, the Cameron Peak fire burned more than 200,000 acres on the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in Colorado. These issues are of imminent concern for our partners at the Forest Service (USFS), as they are tasked with wildfire risk and invasive species mitigation. Disturbances such as wildfires can substantially increase the rate and extent of cheatgrass spread. Current cheatgrass mitigation methods rely on field crews to physically locate cheatgrass on the landscape, which takes time, money, and extensive manpower. Here, we developed two Random Forest models within the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) using remote sensing predictors derived from Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The first model identified suitable cheatgrass habitat while the other detected cheatgrass presence during the 2021 growing season. Topographic variables were found to be the most important in driving the habitat suitability model. Cheatgrass detection was also found to be possible within a short timespan with limited imagery surrounding a phenological shift of the plant. Maps produced from these models provide natural resource managers the ability to implement early detection and rapid response to prevent the spread of cheatgrass to new locations."

The proposed method first converts the 3D path planning problem to a 2D problem by constructing an obstacle map at a given above-ground-level altitude. A quad-tree decomposition is then used to build a search space in terms of obstacle occupancy and wind difference. The wind cost of traveling through each cell is defined based on energy consumption under various wind conditions. A repulsive potential is also adopted to make sure that the flight plans stay away from obstacles. The Theta* search algorithm, a variant of A* algorithm, is applied to mitigate the path angle change constraints introduced by grid-based graphs. With the Theta* and postsmoothing techniques, an obstacle-free, wind efficient, and constant above-ground-level flight plan can be quickly generated for sUAV operations in urban environments while meeting the lateral path angle constraints. The results showed that the path planning algorithm is efficient and can be finished within several seconds. With a proper choice of wind coefficient, the proposed path planning algorithm outperforms the multiple-shooting trajectory optimization method even in an obstacle-free environment. With the flexibility of incorporating other geo-related costs and computation efficiency, the proposed algorithm shows the potential for real-time flight path planning in complex urban environments."

The noise can be effectively filtered out on the ground through a specific technique called time-delay interferometry (TDI), which  relies on the measurements of time-delays between spacecraft and careful modeling of how laser noise enters the interferometric data. Recently, this technique has been recast into a matrix-based formalism by several authors, offering a different perspective on TDI, particularly by relating it to principal component analysis (PCA). In this work, we demonstrate that we can cancel laser frequency noise by directly applying PCA to a set of shifted data samples, without any prior knowledge of the relationship between single-link measurements and noise, nor time-delays. We show that this fully data-driven algorithm achieves a gravitational-wave sensitivity similar to classic TDI."

However, recent ‘space weathering’ and/or ‘solar   heating’ create ambiguities between the uppermost layer observable by   remote-sensing and the pristine material from the parent body. Hayabusa2 remote-sensing observations found that on the asteroid (162173) Ryugu both north and south pole regions preserve the material least processed by space weathering: spectrally blue carbonaceous  chondritic material with a 0.7-μm band absorption, indicative of Fe-bearing phyllosilicates. This discovery suggests that Ryugu’s parent body   experienced intensive aqueous alteration and subsequent thermal metamorphism at 670 – 970 K. Ryugu’s parent body was heated by radioactive decay of short-lived radionuclides possibly because of its early formation 2-2.5 Ma. Ryugu’s parent body which is spectrally blue represents some of the most ancient of carbonaceous chondritic compositions from the solar system.

Embedded between these alternating jets, large vortices, characterized by their high speed closed circulations can be found in several latitudinal bands. The Great Red Spot (GRS) and the White Ovals (WOS) located at ≈22 and ≈30 degrees south respectively1 are the largest of these vortices. The GRS has undergone significant changes in size, coloration and maximum circumferential wind speed over the last two decades. The three WOS also experienced changes in size, and they merged over time until there was only one remaining, which since then has been formally known as oval BA. Here we used over four decades worth of data from the Database for Object Positions on Jupiter (JUPOS), to investigate the long-term mean longitudinal drift of these largest vortices, and to characterize the deviations from this mean drift. A linear fit to the GRS drift speed for the last two decades gives a rate of change of (3.1 ± 0.4)^(-3°)/day/year. For oval BA we find that its annual drift rate changed from -0.39°/day in 2016 to -0.58°/day in 2020 following a steep trend that is best fitted by a second order polynomial. Regarding oscillations, we find that for the last two decades the GRS has continued to oscillate longitudinally with the same period (90 days) and peak-to-peak amplitude (1.2 degrees longitude) as reported historically. For the WOS, the data prior to 2000 seems to indicate that they presented similar oscillations with periods of ≈158 days and peak-to-peak amplitudes of ≈1.6 degrees. The analysis of the data for oval BA since the year 2000 reveals evidence of an oscillation with a period of ≈138 days and peak-to-peak amplitude of ≈1.6 degrees longitude."

Unfortunately, the desires of concept developers are often in conflict with the limited technical budgets afforded within the constraints of a SmallSat mission. Chief amongst these limited technical budgets, ironically, are the limited mass and volume budgets that enable them in the first place.Mass and volume budgets are consumed in closure of the other technical budgets in space systems: science error budgets, delta-v and propellent budgets, power and energy budgets, and thermal budgets, to name a few. Most aspects of these budgets are unaffected by the miniaturization of digital electronics enabled by modern physics, but are instead governed by the laws of classical physics, worked out by Europeans, long since dead.The fundamental laws of classical physics provide the couplings between these budgets, and provide a way to help potential users realize the practical limitations inherent in SmallSat systems. Understanding the fundamental limitations better positions concept developers to find innovative solutions with these systems and not inefficiently pursue infeasible approaches to their needs."

Throughout the last 25 years, Team-X at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has expanded its application of the collaborative, concurrent study approach into every facet necessary to win competed proposals. The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 created an immediate and new constraint on these studies – the need to conduct them with remote participants, both on the client side requesting the study, but also on the provider side producing the study. This paper provides lessons learned from dozens of design studies run by Team-X at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory during the COVID-19 pandemic. These lessons span all aspects of the information infrastructure: the people, processes, procedures, methods, tools, and “facilities”. These lessons learned will have applicability post-pandemic, as they have shown how best to incorporate participants, both on the provider side, and on the client side, who cannot travel or otherwise be co-located during collaborative, concurrent study sessions."

The most common patching method has been a hot patch, in which running flight software is modified after being copied into RAM from its persistent storage. The latest hot patch to be installed on Curiosity fixed an issue in the robotic arm software that computes generalized inverse kinematics. Additional unit testing performed since the start of the surface mission revealed that this software can sometimes produce erroneous solutions.The cause was identified as numerical instability in a quartic root finder. When the inputs to that solver are not well conditioned, floating-point numerical issuescan cause erroneous roots to be reported. In theory, this could result in the robotic arm turret instruments being commanded to unintended positions, for example, below the terrain surface. Out of approximately 3.7 million unit test cases, 97.2\% of the position errors were below 5 mm. However, there were 16 test cases where theposition error was greater than 20 cm, and the maximum position error was 1.2 meters.The patch was uploaded to Curiosity on sol 2642 (January 11, 2020) after the solution was developed, re-implemented as a hot patch, and validated and verified using Earth-based Curiosity testbeds. A checkout test of the patch was performed on Curiosity on sol 2657, and nominal use of the patch began on sol 2658. In this paper, we describe the steps that led to integrating the arm kinematic hot patch into Curiosity's flight software, from the discovery of the bug to the nominal use of the patch in flight."

Low cost small spacecraft missions can enable unique mission concepts with higher than normal mission risk. This increase in risk can create opportunities for low-cost, compelling science missions in regions that may be otherwise unexplored, provide opportunities for constellations, networks scouts, and fundamentally new measurements. Potential science instruments for MEPAG high-priority investigations suited to small spacecraft mass, volume, power, and cost constraints include compact versions of a camera (MSL EECam), Meteorology (MEDA-ATS or FMI wind, barometry, T, and P), Seismometer (INSIGHT SEIS), Atmosphere and trace Gases (MSL Tunable Laser Spectrometer), Dust (ExoMars MicroMED) analyzers, and fluxgate magnetometers (INSIGHT Mag).

Each of the detector pixels is made of an IR-sensitive GaN microresonator developed to be operated at up to 500 0C. The pixels are employed in sparse array configuration to allow for routing the signal carrying traces and to ease the routing from pixel to circuit, as well as to reduce the power consumption at the expense of moderate post-processing time and increased complexity to recover the image. Three 128 by 128 sparse resonator arrays with the array densities of 10%, 25% and 37.5% are designed, and used in conjunction with the Compressed Sensing (CS) method to reconstruct complex test images from highly incomplete data.

They have evolved from small, university educational opportunities, to industry and governments using them make new discoveries and monetize space. However, with the small, constrained CubeSat form factor; there is often a need to expand the CubeSat through deployable mechanisms once the satellite is in space. This paper is a survey of deployable structures and their actuating mechanisms for CubeSats. The goal of this paper is to provide the applications within which deployable structures have been used in the past for CubeSats, the mechanisms with regards to how they deploy, the lessons learned, and limitations of the various types of deployables. The inputs to this paper come from a relational database in development to track launched CubeSat missions with deployable structures. From this database we can find insightful trends. This paper specifically focuses on the first decade of CubeSat deployables, from 2000 to 2010."

We use3D hydrodynamical simulations to characterize the disc conditions needed for instability, together with its long-term evolution.Tilt growth occurs for disc aspect ratios, evaluated near the disc outer edge, ofH/r0.05, with a weak dependence on viscosityin the wave-like regime of warp propagation.  Lower  mass giant planets are more likely to have circumplanetary  discs thatsatisfy the conditions for instability. We show that the tilt instability can excite the inclination to above the threshold where thecircumplanetary disc becomes unstable to Kozai–Lidov (KL) oscillations. Dissipation in the KL unstable regime caps furthertilt growth, but the disc experiences large oscillations in both inclination and eccentricity. Planetary accretion occurs in episodicaccretion events. We discuss implications of the joint tilt–KL instability for the detectability of circumplanetary discs, for theobliquity evolution of forming giant planets, and for the formation of satellite systems."

The team analyzed inundation dynamics in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Earth observation products from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) 2, and International Space Station (ISS) Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR (GEDI). The team improved the landcover classification using the Random Forest algorithm in GEE by adding canopy height data derived from GEDI, elevation and slope data from Copernicus, and additional multi-spectral band ratios from Landsat 8. The pixel-based land cover classification produced an overall accuracy of 88%. Experiments measuring inundation extent using L-band SAR included comparing results with a priori knowledge, topography datasets, and auxiliary datasets. We iteratively tested and found threshold values for identifying forested inundation using the ratio for HH divided by HV.

We have followed up this object in the X-rays with an ongoing campaign that started in 2018 May and that includes 265 NICER (for a total of 678 ks) and 14 Swift/XRT (26 ks) observations, as well as three simultaneous XMM-Newton/NuSTAR (158/169 ks) exposures. In the X-rays, 1ES 1927+654 shows a behavior unlike any previously known AGN. The source is extremely variable both in spectral shape and flux and does not show any correlation between X-ray and UV flux on timescales of hours or weeks/months. After the outburst, the power-law component almost completely disappeared, and the source showed an extremely soft continuum dominated by a blackbody component. The temperature of the blackbody increases with the luminosity, going from kT∼80 eV (for a 0.3–2 keV luminosity ofL0.3−2∼1041.5erg s−1) to∼200 eV (forL0.3−2∼1044erg s−1). The spectra show evidence of ionized outflows and of a prominent feature at ∼1 keV, which can be reproduced by a broad emission line. The unique characteristics of1ES 1927+654 in the X-ray band suggest that it belongs to a new type of changing-look AGN. Future X-ray surveys might detect several more objects with similar properties."

However, practical applications of polarization technology are still limited because of complexity of measurement and interpretation of polarimetric observations. In this study, we analyze the performance of a new component approach developed in the frame of the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. In addition to aerosol optical properties including particle size distribution, non-sphericity and index of refraction that are commonly derived from multi-angle radiance and polarization measurements, the GRASP/Component approach also provides some information about aerosol composition. Specifically, in this approach aerosol is modeled as an internal mixture of several components with distinctly different chemical compositions and known refractive indices. The approach is intended not only to provide additional insight on aerosol composition but also to improve retrieval of basic aerosol optical properties. This study presents comprehensive validation and evaluation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Ångstrom exponent (AE), fine mode AOD (AODF), coarse mode AOD (AODC), and single scattering albedo (SSA) as retrieved by the GRASP/Component approach. The GRASP/Component products include aerosol retrievals using two different aerosol component mixing rules, i.e., Maxwell-Garnett (MG) effective medium approximation and a simple Volume- Weighted averaging (VW). The differences between the results obtained using these two assumptions are also discussed. The obtained results show that the aerosol optical property products of GRASP/Component approach have good agreement with the ground-based AERONET measurements, which is comparable to other PARASOL/ GRASP approaches. Specifically, the AOD retrieved by GRASP/Component approach show high correlation and nearly no bias both over land and ocean, as compared with AERONET. The more detailed aerosol properties such as AE, AODF, AODC and SSA also show one of the best comparisons with AERONET. These improvements can probably be attributed to the use of the additional physical constraints on spectral dependence of the complex refractive index and the reduction of total number of aerosol parameters directly retrieved in the GRASP/Component approach. In addition, the choice of mixing rules had no significant effect on optical retrievals. With the exception of SSA, the results obtained based on the MG mixing rule were found to be slightly better over those obtained using VW mixing rule, especially for bias."

The decline of these forests not only threatens the integrity of valuable ecosystems but can also produce detrimental impacts on mangrove-dependent
communities. Ecuador is the largest producer of farmed Pacific white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in South America. This industry’s growth and success have come at the expense of the country’s mangrove forests. This
paper analyzes the impacts of shrimp aquaculture development on a mangrove-dependent community in Esmeraldas province, Ecuador. Furthermore, this research highlights how gender and gendered norms inform the strategies adopted by different actors in response to these processes. Drawing from ethnographic and Global Positioning System data collected in situ, this study shows that women are disproportionately affected by the loss of mangrove forests. Mangrove forests have historically provided women sustenance, opportunities for income generation, and the ability to pass on cultural traditions. The establishment of the aquaculture sector also created a collapse of local livelihoods. Losing access to traditional livelihood practices pushed men into the mangroves to gather cockles, a productive activity customarily only practiced by women. This livelihood shift for men further contributes to the displacement of women from the mangrove forests. The introduction of industrial shrimp farming increased the community’s reliance on mangrove resources. The overuse of these resources is leading to a depletion of mangrove cockle populations, putting the community in a vulnerable position as both men and women are increasingly dependent on this fishery to subsist."

Eddy covariance (EC) measurements of CH4 flux are ideal for constraining ecosystem-scale CH4 emissions due to quasi-continuous and high-temporal-resolution CH4 flux measurements, coincident carbon dioxide, water, and energy flux measurements, lack of ecosystem disturbance, and increased availability of datasets over the last decade. Here, we (1) describe the newly published dataset, FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0, the first open-source global dataset of CH4 EC measurements (available at https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/, last access: 7 April 2021). FLUXNET-CH4 includes half-hourly and daily gap-filled and non-gap-filled aggregated CH4 fluxes and meteorological data from 79 sites globally: 42 freshwater wetlands, 6 brackish and saline wetlands, 7 formerly drained ecosystems, 7 rice paddy sites, 2 lakes, and 15 uplands. Then, we (2) evaluate FLUXNET-CH4 representativeness for freshwater wetland coverage globally because the majority of sites in FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 are freshwater wetlands which are a substantial source of total atmospheric CH4 emissions; and (3) we provide the first global estimates of the seasonal variability and seasonality predictors of freshwater wetland CH4 fluxes. Our representativeness analysis suggests that the freshwater wetland sites in the dataset cover global wetland bioclimatic attributes (encompassing energy, moisture, and vegetation-related parameters) in arctic, boreal, and temperate regions but only sparsely cover humid tropical regions. Seasonality metrics of wetland CH4 emissions vary considerably across latitudinal bands. In freshwater wetlands (except those between 20°S to 20°N) the spring onset of elevated CH4 emissions starts 3 d earlier, and the CH4 emission season lasts 4 d longer, for each degree Celsius increase in mean annual air temperature. On average, the spring onset of increasing CH4 emissions lags behind soil warming by 1 month, with very few sites experiencing increased CH4 emissions prior to the onset of soil warming. In contrast, roughly half of these sites experience the spring onset of rising CH4 emissions prior to the spring increase in gross primary productivity (GPP). The timing of peak summer CH4 emissions does not correlate with the timing for either peak summer temperature or peak GPP. Our results provide seasonality parameters for CH4 modeling and highlight seasonality metrics that cannot be predicted by temperature or GPP (i.e., seasonality of CH4 peak). FLUXNET-CH4 is a powerful new resource for diagnosing and understanding the role of terrestrial ecosystems and climate drivers in the global CH4 cycle, and future additions of sites in tropical ecosystems and site years of data collection will provide added value to this database. All seasonality parameters are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4672601 (Delwiche et al., 2021). Additionally, raw FLUXNET-CH4 data used to extract seasonality parameters can be downloaded from  https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/ (last access: 7 April 2021), and a complete list of the 79 individual site data DOIs is provided in Table 2 of this paper."

Primarily, AERONET-OC measurements allow determination of the water-leaving radiance required for the validation of ocean color satellite data products. In this study, we characterized and calibrated one instrument from the AERONET-OC network, identified as AERONET #080. A laser-illuminated integrating sphere of known radiance enabled determination of the absolute radiance responsivity for 7 bands. We compared the results to calibrations from the AERONET facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. These results agree within the estimated mean comparison uncertainty of 1.88 % (k = 2). We also assessed these results using calibrated lamp-illuminated integrating spheres and observed a spectral dependence to the comparison results that is unexplained."

MS sensors are limited to cloud free conditions, whereas SAR imagery is plagued by noise-like speckle. Prior studies that use combinations of MS and SAR data to overcome individual limitations of these sensors have not fully examined sensitivity of flood mapping performance to different combinations of SAR and MS derived spectral indices or band transformations in color space. This study explores the use of diverse bands of Sentinel 2 (S2) through well-established water indices and Sentinel 1 (S1) derived SAR imagery along with their combinations to assess their capability for generating accurate flood inundation maps. The robustness in performance of S-1 and S-2 band combinations was evaluated using 446 hand labeled flood inundation images spanning across 11 flood events from Sen1Floods11 dataset which are highly diverse in terms of land cover as well as location. A modified K-fold cross validation approach is used to evaluate the performance of 32 combinations of S1 and S2 bands using a fully connected deep convolutional neural network known as U-Net. Our results indicated that usage of elevation information has improved the capability of S1 imagery to produce more accurate flood inundation maps. Compared to a median F1 score of 0.62 when using only S1 bands, the combined use of S1 and elevation information led to an improved median F1 score of 0.73. Water extraction indices based on S2 bands have a statistically significant superior performance in comparison to S1. Among all the band combinations, HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) transformation of S2 bands provides a median F1 score of 0.9, outperforming the commonly used water spectral indices owing to HSV’s transformation’s superior contrast distinguishing abilities. Additionally, U-Net algorithm was able to learn the relationship between raw S2 based water extraction indices and their corresponding raw S2 bands, but not of HSV owing to relatively complex computation involved in the latter. Results of the paper establishes important benchmarks for the extension of S1 and S2 data-based flood inundation mapping efforts over large spatial extents."

The impact of this revision was tested over the South American Dry Chaco, an ecoregion characterized by deforestation and forest degradation since the 1980s. Most large-scale LSMs may lack the ability to correctly represent the ongoing deforestation processes in this region, because most LSMs use climatological vegetation indices and static land cover information. The default LIS parameters were revised with improved soil parameters, satellite-based interannually varying vegetation indices (leaf area index and green vegetation fraction) instead of climatological vegetation indices, and yearly land cover information instead of static land cover. A relative comparison in terms of water budget components and “efficiency space” for various baseline and revised experiments showed that large regional and long-term differences in the simulated water budget partitioning relate to different LSM structures, whereas smaller local differences resulted from updated soil, vegetation and land cover parameters. Furthermore, the different LSM structures redistributed water differently in response to these parameter updates. A time-series comparison of the simulations to independent satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration and brightness temperature (Tb) showed that no LSM setup significantly outperformed another for the entire region and that not all LSM simulations improved with updated parameter values. However, the revised soil parameters generally reduced the bias between simulated surface soil moisture and pixel-scale in situ observations and the bias between simulated Tb and regional Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) observations. Our results suggest that the different hydrological responses of various LSMs to vegetation changes may need further attention to gain benefits from vegetation data assimilation."

Even in the absence of incident light, the Si detectors are occasionally excited by high energy charged particles that pass through the spacecraft. These particle radiation events are, fortunately, infrequent enough that they do not lead to significant degradation of the detectors and they do not have a significant impact on the Earth scene radiance images. On the other hand, they are frequent enough that the cumulative data from many years on orbit may provide valuable diagnostic information about the sensors. In this paper, we provide some basic statistics on the frequency and magnitude of the particle excitation events for MODIS and VIIRS and explore the usefulness of this data as a measure of electronic crosstalk. Large amounts of crosstalk can degrade the quality of the Earth images, so it is crucial to have methods to characterize and correct for it on-orbit, which has previously been done for MODIS using lunar image analysis. The particle excitations can manifest as single-pixel spikes in the otherwise dark space view background, which may be an ideal source for evaluating crosstalk. We derive crosstalk coefficients between the NIR band detectors of Terra MODIS, and compare them to coefficients previously derived from lunar observations. The same approach is applied to SNPP VIIRS, which does not show any significant electronic crosstalk. While the HgCdTe detectors used in the MODIS and VIIRS infrared bands can also be excited by particle radiation, the magnitudes of the excitations are much smaller compared to the Si detectors and in general are not large enough to be useful for examining crosstalk."

After more than 21 and 19 years on-orbit, the TEB performances for Terra and Aqua MODIS have been generally stable. However, contamination from electronic crosstalk, a known issue since prelaunch, has affected the L1B image quality and measurement accuracy. In addition to the photovoltaic (PV) longwave infrared (LWIR) bands crosstalk correction included in Terra MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1), a crosstalk correction for select detectors in the Terra and Aqua mid-wave infrared (MWIR) and Aqua PV LWIR bands are applied in C7. The mission-long crosstalk coefficients for the selected detectors are derived and populated in the form of LUTs. The crosstalk correction is applied to both on-orbit calibration and the algorithm used to generate Earth-view L1B products. Among these detectors, the Aqua MODIS band 24 detector 1 crosstalk has the largest impact on image quality, with striping observed over cold scenes for both Terra and Aqua MODIS. The images of C7 L1B and C6.1 are compared to assess the impact of the correction. Additional assessments using Earthview measurements and inter-comparison also revealed the need for improvement of calibration stability and consistence for select bands. Additional improvements for long-term stability and mirror side consistence were developed using quasideep convective clouds (qDCC), Dome-C, ocean, desert, and inter-comparison with other instruments."

This band operates in three different gain stages: low, mid, and high gain (LG, MG, and HG) that cover a remarkable dynamic range with its HG stage being extremely sensitive to low-light scenes. Similar to its reflective solar bands, the VIIRS uses an on-board solar diffuser for its DNB LG stage calibration, whereas the DNB MG and HG calibrations are performed using relative or ratioing approaches. In this paper, we provide an assessment of VIIRS DNB HG calibrations using stars that appear in the field-of-view of its space view (SV), focusing on the computation of the gain trending and associated tool development. We also describe various strategies and procedures developed for DNB HG calibration stability monitoring and inter-comparisons among different VIIRS instruments and discuss some of the complications and limits to this approach, including under-sampling of the stellar image, saturation, and crowding. For S-NPP VIIRS, it includes the use of the modulated relative spectral response (RSR) resulting from wavelength-dependent degradation of the sensor optics. Results show that the star-based response trending for the DNB HG is consistent with that derived from on-board solar diffuser and that the calibration difference between S-NPP and N-20 VIIRS DNB requires additional effort to address, especially for research studies and applications using data from both sensors."

However, their ability to withstand harsh cyclone conditions depends on plant resilience traits and geomorphology. Using airborne lidar and satellite imagery collected before and after Hurricane Irma, we estimated that 62% of mangroves in southwest Florida suffered canopy damage, with largest impacts in tall forests (>10 m). Mangroves on well-drained sites (83%) resprouted new leaves within one year after the storm. By contrast, in poorly-drained inland sites, we detected one of the largest mangrove diebacks on record (10,760 ha), triggered by Irma. We found evidence that the combination of low elevation (median = 9.4 cm asl), storm surge water levels (>1.4 m above the ground surface), and hydrologic isolation drove coastal forest vulnerability and were independent of tree height or wind exposure.

To this end, this study systematically evaluates four sets of model simulations at point scale, basin scale, and domain scale obtained from different spatial resolutions including 0.01° (∼1-km) and 0.25° (∼25-km). The assessment is conducted via comparisons against ground-based observations and satellite-derived reference products. The key variables of interest include surface net shortwave radiation, surface net longwave radiation, skin temperature, near-surface soil temperature, snow depth, snow water equivalent, and total runoff. In the evaluation against ground-based measurements, the superiority of the 0.01° estimates are mostly demonstrated across relatively complex terrain. Specifically, hyper-resolution modeling improves the skill in meteorological forcing estimates (except precipitation) by 9% relative to coarse-resolution estimates. The model forced by downscaled forcings in its entirety yields the highest skill in model output states as well as precipitation, which improves the skill obtained by coarse-resolution estimates by 7%. These findings, on one hand, corroborate the importance of employing the hyper-resolution versus coarse-resolution modeling in areas characterized by complex terrain. On the other hand, by evaluating four sets of model simulations forced with different precipitation products, this study emphasizes the importance of accurate hyper-resolution precipitation products to drive model simulations."

Currently, no single sensor can provide data at the desired high temporal, spectral and spatial resolutions. Our field measurements obtained using the integrated UAS Piccolo system during the summers of2017 and 2018 demonstrate that science quality reflectance and solar induced fluorescence (SIF) data can be retrieved with high temporal frequency using small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). The implemented approach facilitates data comparisons through space and time, and the integration with other spectral satellite and airborne data. This investigation contributes for bridging the gap in Earth observation between field and airborne measurements by implementing autonomous methods for obtaining high temporal frequency spectroscopy measurements from an Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) at various illumination conditions. An advancement in the Intelligent Payload Module (IPM) facilitated the implementation of an optimization workflow to collect spectral data for characterizing vegetation reflectance and solar induced fluorescence (SIF)."

The basic idea for constructing a proxy is to capturethe conceptual difficulties one encounters when assimilating observations into high-resolution,3-D geodynamo simulations, but at a much lower computational cost. The framework of usingproxy models as ‘gate-keepers’ for numerical methods that could/should be considered formore extensive testing on operational models has proven useful in numerical weather predic-tion, where advances in data assimilation and, hence, improved forecast skill, are at least inpart enabled by the common use of a wide range of proxy models.

One possible avenue is the search for serendipitous optical/near-infrared counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and gravitational-wave (GW) signals, known as kilonovae. With surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which observes the sky with a cadence of ∼3 d, the existing counterpart locations are likely to be observed; however, due to the significant amount of sky to explore, it is difficult to search for these fast-evolving candidates. Thus, it is beneficial to optimize the survey cadence for realtime kilonova identification and enable further photometric and spectroscopic observations. We explore how the cadence of wide field-of-view surveys like ZTF can be improved to facilitate such identifications. We show that with improved observational choices, e.g. the adoption of three epochs per night on a ∼ nightly basis, and the prioritization of redder photometric bands, detection efficiencies improve by about a factor of two relative to the nominal cadence. We also provide realistic hypothetical constraints on the kilonova rate as a form of comparison between strategies, assuming that no kilonovae are detected throughout the long-term execution of the respective observing plan. These results demonstrate how an optimal use of ZTF increases the likelihood of kilonova discovery independent of GWs or GRBs, thereby allowing for a sensitive search with less interruption of its nominal cadence through Target of Opportunity programs."

The origin of this CO is unclear, in particular whether it is left over from the protoplanetary disk phase or is second-generation material released from collisions between icy bodies like debris dust. The primary unexplored avenue for distinguishing the origin of the material is understanding its molecular composition. Here we present a deep search for five molecules (CN, HCN, HCO+, SiO, and CH3OH) in the debris disk around 49 Ceti. We take advantage of the high sensitivity of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at Band 7 to integrate for 3.2 hr at modest spatial (1′′) and spectral (0.8 km s−1) resolution. Our search yields stringent upper limits on the flux of all surveyed molecular lines, which imply abundances relative to CO that are orders of magnitude lower than those observed in protoplanetary disks and solar system comets, and also those predicted in outgassing models of second-generation material. However, if CI shielding is responsible for extending the lifetime of any CO produced in second-generation collisions as proposed by Kral et al., then the line ratios do not reflect true ice phase chemical abundances but rather imply that CO is shielded by its own photodissociation product, CI, and other molecules are rapidly photodissociated by the stellar and interstellar radiation field."

In this study, we use the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model with coupled aerosol, cloud, radiation, and ecosystem modules to investigate the impact of Amazon biomass burning aerosols on ecosystem productivity, as well as the role of the Amazon’s clouds in tempering this impact. The study focuses on a seven-year period (2010-2016) during which the Amazon experienced a variety of dynamic environments (e.g., La Niña, normal years, and El Niño). The direct radiative impact of biomass burning aerosols on ecosystem productivity—called here the aerosol diffuse radiation fertilization effect —is found to increase Amazonian Gross Primary Production (GPP) by 2.6% via a 3.8% increase in diffuse PAR (DFPAR) despite a 5.4% decrease in direct PAR (DRPAR) on multiyear average during burning seasons. On a monthly basis, this increase in GPP can be as large as 9.9% (occurring in August 2010). Consequently, the net primary production (NPP) in Amazon is increased by 1.5%, or ~92 Tg C  a-1– equivalent to ~37% of the average carbon lost due to Amazon fires over the seven years considered.  Clouds, however, strongly regulate the effectiveness of the aerosol diffuse radiation fertilization effect. The efficiency of this fertilization effect is the highest in cloud-free conditions and linearly decreases with increasing cloud amount until the cloud fraction reaches ~0.8, at which point the aerosol-influenced light changes from being a stimulator to an inhibitor of plant growth. Nevertheless, interannual changes in the overall strength of the aerosol diffuse radiation fertilization effect are primarily controlled by the large interannual changes in biomass burning aerosols rather than by changes in cloudiness during the studied period."

However, there is large uncertainty in its burden and composition due to limited global measurements. Here, we present observations from eleven different aircraft campaigns from around the globe and investigate how aerosol pH and ammonium balance change from polluted to remote regions, such as over the oceans. Both parameters show increasing acidity with remoteness, at all altitudes, with pH decreasing from about 3 to about -1 and ammonium balance decreasing from almost 1 to nearly 0. We compare these observations against nine widely used chemical transport models and find that the simulations show more scatter (generally R(exp 2) < 0.50) and typically predict less acidic aerosol in the most remote regions. These differences in observations and predictions are likely to result in underestimating the model-predicted direct radiative cooling effect for sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium aerosol by 15-39%."

In most previous studies, chemical compositions of atmospheric particles were provided using filter-based offline analyses, which were unable to provide long-term and in-situ measurements that resolve sufficient temporal variations of air pollution and meteorology, hindering the resolution of the relationship between air quality and   visibility.   Here,   we   present   a   year-long   continuously   measured   data   from   a comprehensive suite of online instruments to investigate diurnal and seasonal impacts of the aerosol chemical compositions in PM2.5 on visibility seasonally and diurnally. The measured dry aerosol extinction at λ = 550 nm reached a closure with that predicted by aerosol compositions within 12%. However, the hygroscopic growth of particles under ambient RH could enhance the aerosol extinction by a factor of 2 – 6, matching the perceptive visibility of the public. Particulate ammonium nitrate was most sensitive to reducing visibility, while ammonium sulfate contributed the most to the light extinction. In spring and winter, the monsoon and stagnant air masses reduced the visibility and increased PM2.5 (> 35 μg m-3).The moisture was found to substantially enhance the light extinction under RH = 60 – 90%,reducing visibility by approximately 15 km, largely attributed to hygroscopic inorganic salts.This study serves as a metric to highlight the need to consider the influence of RH, and aqueous reactions in producing secondary inorganic aerosols on atmospheric visibility, underpinning the more accurate mitigation strategies of air pollution."

The study was limited to four tiles located in mid-Atlantic United States (H11V05), Canada (H12V03),central Amazon (H11V09), and North-Eastern China (H27V05) and used over 5000 MODIS granules in 2018. Overall, there is a remarkable agreement between the best quality pixels of the two products, in particular in the Red and NIR bands. Over selected tiles, the evaluation found that MAIAC provides from 4 to 25% more high-quality retrievals thanMOD09 annually, with the largest difference in tropical regions, confirming results of the previous studies. The comparison of spectral characteristics showed a systematic MAIAC-MOD09 difference increasing from NIR to Blue, typical of biases of a Lambertian assumption in MOD09 algorithm. Over the North-Eastern China, MCD19A1 SR is found more stable at wide range of aerosol optical depth (AOD) variations, whereasMOD09 SR shows a consistent positive bias increasing with AOD and at shorter wavelengths. The observed SR differences can be attributed to differences in cloud detection, aerosol retrieval and in atmospheric correction which is performed using an accurate BRDF-coupled radiative transfer model in MAIAC and a Lambertian surface model in MOD09. While this study is not representative of the global performance because of its limited geographical coverage, it should help the land community to better understand the differences between the two products."

Volatile and organic chemistry at the surface is critical in determining habitability and detecting the presence of past or extant life. Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) could be an enabling technology for in situ missions to ice worlds, providing both power and heat for long durations where solar power would not be feasible. However, it is necessary to understand the potential impact of RPS upon the local environment, to ensure that the rejected heat from RPS does not compromise science measurements or planetary protection requirements. To address these concerns, an RPS Ice World Lander Study was carried out in 2019 to investigate possible requirements on RPS surface mission concepts and approaches to excess heat management. The study focused on two destinations that are representative of the range of potential environments: Europa and Enceladus.Initial analysis showed that, due to the very low pressures on the surfaces of most ice world targets, surface melting does not occur because the water ice does not meet the triple-point. A 4 kW heat source suspended above the surface of Europa or Enceladus would not cause any melting, only sublimation.The study used a surface sublimation limit of 10 cm over a two-year period (the baseline for the recent Europa Lander study). To stay within this limit, Europa, with its relatively warm surface, could tolerate only 10 W/m2 of surface heat flux. Enceladus, with its relatively cold pure ice composition, could tolerate up to 100 W/m2.Various lander and heat shield configurations were analyzed for their heat flux radiated from the RPS to the surface. For a given heat shield configuration, the study team determined the minimum height of the RPS above the surface for which the heat flux would be within the accepted parameters for Europa and for Enceladus. Based on these thermal analyses, such RPS-powered landers could remain compliant with science investigation and planetary protection requirements with only modest mass allocated to spacecraft thermal accommodations."

In our solar system we have identified six Ocean and Ice Worlds, namely Earth, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Enceladus, and Titan. Other potential targets include Dione, Triton, and Pluto. As documented in the Planetary Decadal Survey [1] and the NASA Roadmap to Ocean Worlds [2], these worlds are compelling science destinations, with oceans situated below their tens of kilometers thick ice shells. To reach them we need a new exploration paradigm with novel technological solutions. Key technological challenges revolve around the power for the probe and for melting, as well as protecting the payload against the extreme environments, including high pressure, low temperature, corrosion, and radiation. Far away from the Sun, and melted into the ice, we may only rely on long-lived internal power generation. Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) with either static or dynamic conversion, utilizing the heat of decaying Plutonium-238, could be good candidates. We need suitable payloads that are protected and could survive the extreme environments, as well as enabling power and thermal systems for melting through the ice shield and to swim in the ocean below the ice. RPS could support the probe’s instruments and sub-systems, as well as provide a heat source for melting the ice while keeping the components at operating temperatures. Mitigating the external pressure while immersing inside the ice shell, and in the ocean, would require a new RPS design that operates inside a Pressure Vessel. In our paper, we will discuss general mission architecture trades and the sizing of a next generation RPS housed in a pressure vessel, broadly applicable to any of the Ocean Worlds satellites of interest. Through a technology focused approach, we address interconnected design and mission architecture aspects, including considerations for: the RPS and the Pressure Vessel; extreme environmental constraints; g-load tolerance; power and thermal systems sizing for science measurements; spacecraft operations through all mission phases; subsurface mobility; and planetary protection. The findings will inform the science community on instrument accommodation possibilities; the mission planning community on possible mission concepts; and the RPS development community on the science driven technology considerations."

ACE is crucial for maintaining the safety of the rover, but is computationally expensive. If the most promising candidates in the list of paths are all found to be infeasible, ENav must continue to search the list and run time-consuming ACE evaluations until a feasible path is found. In this paper, we present two heuristics that, given a terrain heightmap around the rover, produce cost estimates that more effectively rank the candidate paths before ACE evaluation. The first heuristic uses Sobel operators and convolution to incorporate the cost of traversing high-gradient terrain. The second heuristic uses a machine learning (ML) model to predict areas that will be deemed untraversable by ACE. We used physics simulations to collect training data for the ML model and to run Monte Carlo trials to quantify navigation performance across a variety of terrains with various slopes and rock distributions. Compared to ENav's baseline performance, integrating the heuristics can lead to a significant reduction in ACE evaluations and average computation time per planning cycle, increase path efficiency, and maintain or improve the rate of successful traverses. This strategy of targeting specific bottlenecks with ML while maintaining the original ACE safety checks provides an example of how ML can be infused into planetary science missions and other safety-critical software."

Current state-of-the-art in ground-based ranging accuracy is on the order of 30 cm, however complicated equipment calibration and significant post-processing is required to achieve this level of ranging accuracy. This article examines ad-hoc approaches that achieve near-optimum real-time ranging performance with reduced complexity by utilizing a DPLL (digital phase-locked loop) to track the phase of the residual carrier for both direct and subcarrier modulated PN sequences, and a DCL (digital Costas loop) to obtain independent estimates of carrier phase and optimal combinations of these implementations to achieve near-optimum real-time performance with reduced computational complexity."

The spacecraft instrument suite includes a magnetometer, a multispectral imager, a gamma ray neutron spectrometer, and an X-band radio telecommunications system. It also includes the Deep Space Optical Communication technical demonstration. These instruments along with other spacecraft components require pointing accuracy to meet their scientific and engineering performance requirements. Early on in the project development, the team established a methodology by which pointing accuracy (knowledge and control) is analyzed against the system requirements by means of pointing error budgets and requirement allocations. A margin policy was implemented to ensure the instrument and engineering component pointing accuracy requirements will be met during verification and in flight. Psyche’s pointing management framework defines detailed rationales for the system and subsystem error allocations of the top level pointing accuracy requirements, with sufficient project level pointing margin, and supports end-to-end pointing requirement verification. This paper will present an overview of the Psyche project’s pointing error budget development process, and discuss the rationale behind the methodology. Psyche’s pointing budget methodology integrates best practices and lessons learned from heritage missions, while focusing on the specific needs of the Psyche spacecraft and its science instruments. Key challenges in the pointing error budget development will be reviewed, and a deep dive into two key Psyche pointing budgets are presented.

Currently, Mars surface assetsrelay data to and from Earth using a number of orbiters inwhat’s known as the Mars Relay Network (MRN). This networkis characterized by a small number of surface assets distributedacross the Martian globe and a larger number of orbiters toprovide relay services. As of June 2020, there are two surfaceassets for which five orbiters are providing relay. During theMSR Campaign, there will be two rovers and a lander that allwill require relay communication from a small number of Marsorbiters to meet the aggressive MSR timeline. The inversion ofthe current MRN paradigm, a system of many surface assetsrequiring relay and few orbiters to provide relay, necessitatesthe unique challenge of optimally allocating relay passes tomaximize the operational capability of all assets. The allocationmust consider a large number of trade variables includingMars asset operational requirements and Earth ground systemconstraints, including staffing schedules, operations planningacross time zones, and more. To address these telecommunicationchallenges, the Mars Asset Relay Mission Link AllocationDesign Environment (MARMLADE) tool was developed. Itis a MATLAB-based tool to assign orbiter passes or Direct-From-Earth (DFE) links to each of the three surface assets andquantify the operational efficiency of each surface asset.MARMLADE uses a data set of simulated Mars relay orbitergeometry and telecommunication capabilities provided by JPL’sTelecom Orbit Analysis and Simulation Tool (TOAST) softwareto compute which asset should get each pass based on a seriesof heuristics and predictions of all assets’ states. WithinMARMLADE, the user can provide inputs including the optionfor time-based pass splitting, fixed FWD data rate capabilities,DFE communication capabilities, and link parameters allowingfor the assessment of complex operations and hardware tradesusing surface mission operational efficiency as a primary figureof merit.

and the composition of the phytoplankton community influences the magnitude and fates of this productivity.
Here, we create a 22-year monthly time series of phytoplankton biomarker pigment concentrations in the
SBC by combining 12 years of high performance liquid chromatography phytoplankton pigment concentrations
with bio-optical models and 10 additional years of bio-optical observations. The bio-optical models skillfully predict
biomarker pigment concentrations representative of five distinct phytoplankton groups (PGs; diatoms, dinoflagellates,
chlorophytes, prymnesiophytes, and picophytoplankton) and resolve seasonal responses to the annual
upwelling-relaxation cycle for all PGs except the dinoflagellates. Our observations indicate that nanophytoplankton
groups respond most rapidly to seasonal upwelling, followed by diatoms, and then by picophytoplankton
as the water column stratifies in the summer. A Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) solution is used to
relate advection of different source waters to the observed PG dynamics. The ROMS simulation results suggest
that, on seasonal time scales, pronounced cross-SBC differences in PG seasonality are related to cross-SBC differences
in source waters. El Niño Southern Oscillation events drive interannual variability in the upwelling response
of most PGs. On decadal time scales, dinoflagellate blooms are associated with the warm phase of the
North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and anomalous advection of Southern California Bight source waters into the SBC.
Taken together, our results provide a novel view of phytoplankton community succession in response to seasonal
upwelling by considering the dynamics of pico- and nano-phytoplankton and suggest that regional surface ocean
advection plays a substantial role in driving phytoplankton composition in the SBC."

GPM’s signature algorithm,  the integratedmultisatellite retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is a next-generation of precipitation product expectedfor wide variety of research and operational applications.  This study evaluates the latest version(V06B) of IMERG and its predecessor, the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) multisatelliteprecipitation (TMPA) 3B42 (V7) using ground-based and gauge-corrected multiradar multisensorsystem (MRMS) precipitation products over the conterminous United States (CONUS). The spatialdistributions of all products are analyzed. The error characteristics are further examined for 3B42 andIMERG in winter and summer by an error decomposition approach, which partitions total bias intohit bias, biases due to missed precipitation and false precipitation. The volumetric and categoricalstatistical metrics are used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the two satellite-basedproducts.  All products show a similar precipitation climatology with some regional differences.The two satellite-based products perform better in the eastern CONUS than in the mountainousWestern CONUS.  The evaluation  demonstrates the  clear  improvement  in IMERG  precipitationproduct in comparison with its predecessor 3B42, especially in reducing missed precipitation inwinter and summer, and hit bias in winter, resulting in better performance in capturing lighter andheavier precipitation."

This provides us a unique probe into the preheating era which we dub the “cosmic microscope”. We identify a distinctive effect of preheating on scalar perturbations that turns the Gaussian primordial fluctuations of a light scalar field into square waves, like a diode. The effect manifests itself as local non-Gaussianity. We present a model, “modulated partial preheating”, where this nonlinear effect is consistent with current observations and can be reached by near future cosmic probes."

We find that UKESM1 captures the historical trend for decreasing concentrations of atmospheric SO2 and SO4(2-) in both Europe and the USA over the period 1987 to 2014. However, in the polluted regions of the eastern USA and Europe, UKESM1 over-predicts surface SO2 concentrations by a factor of 3, while under-predicting surface SO4(2-) concentrations by 25-35%. In the cleaner western USA, the model over-predicts both surface SO2 and SO4(2-) concentrations by a factor of 12 and 1.5 respectively. We find that UKESM1’s bias in surface SO2 and SO4(2-) concentrations is variable according to region and season. We also evaluate UKESM1 against total column SO2 from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) using an updated data product. This comparison provides information about the model’s global performance, finding that UKESM1 over predicts total column SO2 over much of the globe, including the large source regions of India, China, the USA and Europe as well as over outflow regions. Finally, we assess the impact of a more realistic treatment of the model’s SO2 dry deposition parameterization. This change increases SO2 dry deposition to the land and ocean surfaces, thus reducing the atmospheric loading of SO2 and SO(sup 2-)(sub 4). In comparison with the ground-based and satellite observations, we find that the modified parameterization reduces the models over prediction of surface SO2 concentrations and total column SO2. Relative to the ground-based observations the simulated surface SO4(2-) concentrations are also reduced, while the simulated SO2 dry deposition fluxes increase."

PTC had three objectives: (1) validate thermal optical performance models, (2) derive thermal system stability specifications, and (3) demonstrate multi-zonal active thermal control. PTC successfully achieved its objectives and matured active thermal control technology to at least TRL 5. PTC’s key accomplishments are a demonstration of better than 2-mK root-mean-square (rms) stable thermal control of the 1.5-m ultra-low-expansion (ULE®) Advanced Mirror Technology Development-2 (AMTD-2) mirror when exposed to thermal disturbances in a relevant thermal/vacuum environment, and the ability to shape the 1.5-m AMTD-2 mirror to picometer precision."

Comparing our recent 3.6 and 4.5 μm photometry with previously published mid-IR and further multiwavelength data sets, we were able to draw some conclusions about the origin and heating mechanism of the dust in these SNe or in their environments, as well as about possible connection with circumstellar matter (CSM) originating from pre-explosion mass-loss events in the progenitor stars. We also present new results regarding both certain SN classes and single objects. We highlight the mid-IR homogeneity of SNe Ia-CSM, which may be a hint of their common progenitor type and of their basically uniform circumstellar environments. Regarding single objects, it is worth highlighting the late-time interacting Type Ib SNe 2003gk and 2004dk, for which we present the first-ever mid-IR data, which seem to be consistent with clues of ongoing CSM interaction detected in other wavelength ranges. Our current study suggests that long-term mid-IR follow-up observations play a key role in a better understanding of both pre- and post-explosion processes in SNe and their environments. While Spitzer is not available anymore, the expected unique data from the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as long-term near-IR follow-up observations of dusty SNe, can bring us closer to the hidden details of this topic."

To facilitate the technology and algorithm development required to enable this ambitious scientific goal, NASA’s Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) facility at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) recently commissioned the Decadal Survey Testbed (DST), a state-of-the-art, flexible, and extremely stable coronagraph testbed. This testbed integrates years of experience and lessons learned at HCIT and has now demonstrated contrast ratios as low as few times 10−10 in 10% bandwidth. Following the success of DST, the HCIT team has developed a companion testbed, the Decadal Survey Testbed 2 (DST2) that further implements lessons learned from DST, and will provide the HCIT with additional coronagraph testbed capacity and efficiency. Commissioning for DST2 is currently targeted for Fall 2021. Here we provide an update on the status of DST, and report on the design, performance modeling simulations, and status of integration and testing for DST2, highlighting updates to the design from the original DST."
2875,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230006933,2023-08-03,Mission Concept Design for Autonomous Space Missions using Mission-Level Modeling and Simulation,"NASA’s Europa Lander mission is to search for biosignatures on Europa based on in-situ science using a lander architecture. This mission presents a set of challenges that requires a high level of autonomy on the lander system, leading to the need for a new operational paradigm that supports better collaboration and coordination between the lander and the ground operations team. M\&S is used for both designing the onboard system-level autonomy and the ground operations paradigm that allows effective and efficient collaboration and coordination between the lander and the ground operations team. In this paper, M\&S as applied to the design of new mission and operational concepts will be discussed. At its current early stage of the mission development for Europa Lander, the M\&S is used to explore different mission concepts and gain insights for design (formative) rather than to verify and validate fully designed mission concepts quantitatively (summative). Organically, we established a new approach to mission and operational concept exploration using high-fidelity modeling and simulation. M\&S has been an integral part of the approach of defining constraints and assertions, designing mission concepts, assessing (i.e., simulating them), and discovering insights, which feeds back to the definition an design steps. This organically-established approach provided important benefits to the project at its early phase of the development by enabling the project team to be able to build shared understanding of impacts from design characteristics, constraints, and their interactions on the mission performance."
2876,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230006961,2023-08-03,"Long-Duration Wear Testing of the ASTRAEUS Hall Thruster, Phases II & III: 72 kg Xe Throughput & 1.2 MN-s Total Impulse","The thruster component of the Ascendant Sub-kW Transcelestial Electric Propulsion System successfully completed a propellant throughput demonstration of 72 kg Xe in a long-duration wear test planned to eventually exceed 100 kg. The thruster has been operated for a total of 5450 h over three operating conditions: 3287 h at 300 V – 1000 W, 1745 h at 500 V – 1000 W, and 417 h at 400 V – 600 W. A total of 1.2 MN-s of impulse has been demonstrated to date. Thrust, telemetry, and temperature measurements periodically recorded at four operating conditions spanning 200 – 500 V and 200 – 1000 W revealed constant performance across the full test duration. The erosion of the downstream faces of the thruster was observed to be higher than anticipated after the first 5032 h of thruster operation. This issue was traced to the application of sub-nominal magnetic field strengths throughout the LDWT, caused by an electrical-related ground-support equipment issue, which resulted in a downstream shift of the discharge plasma and enhanced erosion of the thruster’s pole covers. Nevertheless, the thruster performance and operational behaviour remained unaffected. High-fidelity plasma simulations of the erosion of the thruster’s downstream faces, supported by prior short-duration wear testing, suggest a theoretical lifetime capability of >30 kh, corresponding to propellant throughput of >450 kg Xe and a total impulse of >7 MNs, at the 300 V – 1000 W operating condition. The test was voluntarily paused after 68 kg Xe and 72 kg Xe throughput, respectively, to take these erosion measurements at the 500 V and 400 V operating conditions before the test was resumed at a different operating condition."
2877,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230006971,2023-08-03,Deriving Deformable Mirror Performance Requirements in Simulation with Experimental Verification,"Coronagraph instruments rely on predictable and stable deformable mirror (DM) surface displacement to achieve the contrast required to detect Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting nearby Solar-type stars. Anomalous DM behavior, such as unstable or pinned actuators, can limit contrast in coronagraphs. Simulating how these undesired behaviors affect the performance of a high contrast imaging architecture is important for developing requirements on their associated hardware.  Simulating a vortex coronagraph (VC) with two deformable mirrors, this study quantifies how the number of pinned actuators affect the performance of Focal Plane Wavefront Sensing and Control algorithms using both Grid Search Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) and Planned EFC, which uses Beta-Bumping. The simulation also quantifies how various types of voltage noise such as zero-mean Gaussian noise, zero-mean periodic noise, and drift can affect the contrast of a VC during an observation run. A tolerance of a change in the Mean Normalized Intensity of ${1\times10^{-11}}$ is allocated to both types of error.  If Planned EFC is used, only 1 pinned actuator on both DMs can be tolerated. If only pure Grid Search EFC is used the DMs cannot have any pinned actuators. For the case of zero-mean Gaussian noise and zero-mean periodic noise, one can tolerate a noise standard deviation of no more than ${\sigma = 0.45 \text{ mV}}$. For drift, we can only tolerate ${\sigma = 0.30 \text{ mV}}$ or less. These results show that the DM electronics and the DM themselves need to be nearly defect free to avoid having more than 1 pinned actuator. The electronics need to be tested for different types of noise statistics and that both the average and standard deviation of the noise should be measured."

The CubeSat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (CIRAS) instrument will demonstrate a fully functional infrared temperature, water vapor and carbon monoxide sounder in a CubeSat sized volume for at least an order of magnitude lower cost than legacy systems. Design for a CubeSat significantly reduces cost of access to space and enables flight in a constellation to reduce revisit time and enable new measurements including 3D winds. A technology demonstration of CIRAS is currently under development at JPL. The effort has completed integration and ambient testing of a high fidelity brassboard, complete with the flight configured optics assembly developed by Ball Aerospace with a JPL Immersion Grating and Black Silicon Entrance Slit. The brassboard includes a flight-configured High Operating Temperature Barrier Infrared Detector (HOT-BIRD) mounted in an Integrated Dewar Cryocooler Assembly (IDCA), enabling testing in the ambient environment. Ambient testing included radiometric testing of the system to characterize the instrument operability and NEdT. Spatial testing was performed to characterize the system line spread function (LSF) in two axes and report FWHM of the LSF. Spectral testing involved an air path test to characterize the spectral/spatial transformation matrix, and an etalon was used to measure the Spectral Response Functions (SRFs). Results of the testing show the CIRAS performs exceptionally well and meets the key performance required of the system. The end result of testing is the CIRAS instrument now meets TRL 4 with confidence in a brassboard configuration ready for thermal vacuum (TVac) testing necessary to achieve TRL 5 for the system."

Laboratory electron beam facilities can be used to test the performance of candidate spacecraft dielectrics. However, limited resources necessitate accelerated testing. The aim of this work is the development of a criterion for determining when an ESD test has run for sufficient time to capture representative ESD behavior. Such a criterion has the potential of saving hours of personnel and facility time per test. A comparison of the distributions of ESD event magnitudes from consecutive segments of an ESD test can be used to determine when the test has reached a quasi-steady state. Once this quasi-steady state has been observed the test may be truncated without a significant reduction in test fidelity."

We present a concept for radio detection of UHECRs impacting the Moon's regolith from low-lunar orbit called the Zettavolt Askaryan Polarimeter (ZAP). ZAP would observe several thousands of events above the cutoff (~40 EeV) with a full-sky field of view to test whether UHECRs originate from Starburst Galaxies, Active Galactic Nuclei, or other sources associated with the matter distribution of the local universe at a distance $>$ 1 MPc. The unprecedented sensitivity of ZAP to energies beyond 100 EeV would enable a test of source acceleration mechanisms. At higher energies, ZAP would produce the most stringent limits on super heavy dark matter (SHDM) via limits on neutrinos and gamma rays resulting from self-annihilation or decay."

Unlike all its predecessors, the tool allows to (i) visually model the operational problem and context entirely (ii) optimize to find near-optimal schedules while taking uncertainty into account and deals with (iii) a combination of various {key performance indicators (KPIs). It comes with a web user interface. Part or all of the modelled activities may be associated to random variables describing their stochastic durations, in order to produce schedules that are robust w.r.t. temporal uncertainty. Hence, depending on the pursued KPIs, the schedules maximize a combination of the following terms: the probability of satisfying the problem constraints, the expected return/efficiency, the expected outcome quality, and even the operators' wellness by minimizing its expected extra-hours. Initially developed for spatial exploration and demonstration in the context of Mars analog missions, this versatile tool is here applied to operations management in both biotechnology manufacturing and robots parametrization in a cave exploration context."

The testbed is configured as a vortex coronagraph, with one MEMS DM in the pupil plane to create a half dark hole in monochromatic light. High wavefront stability is achieved using an environmentally isolating enclosure, based on the enclosure design previously used on Caltech’s High Contrast Spectroscopy Testbed (HCST). Further, a smaller enclosure has been designed which will enforce humidity conditions necessary for the MEMS DM to operate. We expect this testbed to achieve 1e-8 contrast, and will use this contrast level as a baseline to assess survival or failure of MEMS DMs during vibration testing. In this presentation, we will present an overview of the design of the IACT, commissioning results, and plans for upcoming DM tests in preparation for launch on future space telescopes with coronagraph instruments."

In the absence of radiation effects, these devices are highly desirable for space use. The processor core architecture for ARM devices is licensed to provide computing on multiple hardware platforms. The A5 processor is in a unique pioneering space for providing detailed radiation response data to explore the baseline performance of these devices. These data can help set options for ARM processors and possibly impact design choices for the next generation of ARM fault tolerance capabilities. The SAMA5D3 was tested to establish general SEE performance for a relatively simple implementation of the ARM A5 core. This testing observed SRAM sensitivity starting at an LET of about 3 MeV-cm2/mg, with a saturated cross section of about 2x10-8cm2/bit, and this was determined by both active write and read of the caches, in addition to the use of a debugger to provide test results. Crash/SEFI data was collected using both Linux and bare metal C-code. The onset LET for crashes was about LET 1.5 MeV-cm2/mg, with saturated cross sections of about 2x10-5 cm2 for bare metal (low utilization), and 2x10-4cm2 for Linux (high utilization) tests."

The results add to our fundamental understanding about the formation and the evolution of our solar system. Of special interest are the Outer Planets Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, serving as missing puzzle pieces to the existing data sets. In order to maximize the data and science return from those missions, the tool VAPRE is developed to facilitate the design optimization of planetary entry probe missions by increasing the trade-space. Using a data set of interplanetary trajectories, it assesses the change in availability and accessibility of entry sites on the planets with respect to their latitudes depending on the hyperbolic arrival velocity. In this paper, we introduce the motivation behind the implementation of VAPRE, the science and engineering input gathered to bridge the knowledge between both fields, the design structure of the implementation as well as the significance and future development and potential of the tool VAPRE for future mission concept developments for planetary probe and lander missions."

As part of the NASA Exoplanet Explorations Program’s coronagraph technology development efforts, two sets of Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) deformable mirrors manufactured by Boston Micromachines Corporation were exposed to vibration and thermal cycles representative of launch conditions. The first set were 952-actuator Kilo-DMs that successfully demonstrated 100% actuator survival and achieved ~1e-8 contrast after the environment test. The second round used an engineering-grade 2048-actuator deformable mirror on which few changes were identified after the environmental test. However, each actuator that changed behavior was flagged as anomalous beforehand or was directly adjacent to a defective actuator. From this result, we hypothesized that typical actuators on a science grade deformable mirror are robust to environmental testing. A third set of 2048-actuator deformable mirror have been procured for a planned test to characterize the deformable mirrors using interferometric measurements, contrast results on a new in-air coronagraph testbed, and infrared microscopy on the internal structure of the MEMS devices."

These perturbations are representative of the type of perturbations possible in a flight design and serve as points of validation for dffraction models and error budgets. We show experimental results for two perturbed shapes, a mask with all petals shifted radially outward by 5 um and a mask with shallow sine waves built into two petals. We compare these data to outputs of the optical model and demonstrate better than 25% agreement. We also present images taken in crossed polarized light and use those data to constrain physical parameters of the optical edge. Bringing in previously obtained results for other perturbed shapes, we show an agreement between experiment and model of better than 25% and argue that this satisfies the Milestone 2 criteria."

Current state-of-the-art predictions for ice shelf behavior in a warming climate have large uncertainty, significantly hindered by a lack of in situ melt rate observations under ice shelves, especially near grounding zones. IceNode is a novel robotic vehicle under development at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory to acquire such measurements, but presents a complex design problem owing to the large design space and conflicting performance requirements. Evaluating a preliminary design requires several types of tedious analysis which prevents rapid iteration and exploration of the design space. We present the implementation of a custom system analysis framework which was used to automate analysis such as resource budgeting, mission simulation, mass and buoyancy balancing, and static landing stability analysis of a given design configuration. Using this framework, we selected parameters which had the largest effects on design success and conducted a generative design study in which we programmatically varied a handful of parameters to generate 1540 different design candidates and test them across 160 different environmental scenarios. The custom built system analysis tool enabled rapid development of critical analysis and automated exploration of a large design space to guide preliminary design of the IceNode vehicle."

These include the Crab, Vela, PSR B1706−44, and Geminga, with the first two having pulsed detections above 1 TeV. In some cases, there appears to be very-high-energy (VHE) emission that is an extension of the Fermi spectra to high energies, while in other cases, additional higher-energy spectral components that require a separate emission mechanism may be present. We present results of broadband spectral modeling using global magnetospheric fields and multiple emission mechanisms that include synchro-curvature (SC) and inverse Compton scattered (ICS) radiation from accelerated particles (primaries) and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from lower-energy pairs. Our models predict three distinct VHE components: SC from primaries whose high-energy tail can extend to 100 GeV, SSC from pairs that can extend to several TeV, and ICS from primary particles accelerated in the current sheet that scatter pair synchrotron radiation, which appears beyond 10 TeV. Our models suggest that H.E.S.S.-II and MAGIC have detected the high-energy tail of the primary SC component that produces the Fermi spectrum in Vela, Geminga, and PSR B1706−44. We argue that the ICS component peaking above 10 TeV from Vela has been seen by H.E.S.S. Detection of this emission component from the Crab and other pulsars is possible with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory and Cherenkov Telescope Array, and will directly measure the maximum particle energy in pulsars."

The existing NAQFC uses climatological chemical lateral boundary conditions ( CLBCs), which cannot capture pollutant intrusion events originating outside of the model domain. In this study, we developed a model framework to use dynamic CLBCs from the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS) to drive NAQFC. A mapping of the GEOS chemical species to the CMAQ’s Carbon Bond 5 (CB05)-Aero6 species was developed. The utilization of the GEOS dynamic CLBCs in NAQFC showed the best overall performance in simulating the surface observations during the Saharan dust intrusion and Canadian wildfire events in summer 2015.The simulated PM2.5 was improved from 0.18 to 0.37 and the mean bias was reduced from -6.74 μg/m3 to -2.96 μg/m3 over CONUS. Although the effect of CLBCs on the PM2.5 correlation was mainly near the inflow boundary, its impact on the background concentrations reached further inside the domain. The CLBCs could affect background ozone concentrations through the inflows of ozone itself and its precursors, such as CO. It was further found that the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from satellite retrievals correlated well with the column CO and elemental carbon from GEOS. The satellite-derived AOT CLBCs generally improved the model performance for the wildfire intrusion events during a summer 2018 case study, and demonstrated how satellite observations of atmospheric composition could be used as an alternative method to capture the air quality effects of intrusions when the global model CLBCs, such as GEOS CLBCs, are not available."

major pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) events that resulted in the injection of large amounts of smoke aerosols and other combustion products at the local upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). These plumes of UTLS smoke
with elevated values of aerosol extinction and backscatter compared to the background state were readily tracked by
multiple satellite-based instruments as they spread across the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The plumes were observed
in the lower stratosphere for about 8-10 months following the fire injections, with a stratospheric aerosol e-folding
time of about 5 months. To investigate the radiative impacts of these events on the Earth system, we performed a number of simulations with the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric general circulation model
(AGCM). Observations from multiple remote-sensing instruments were used to calibrate the injection parameters
(location, amount, composition and heights) and optical properties of the smoke aerosols in the model. The resulting
simulations of three-dimensional smoke transport were evaluated for a year from the day of injections using daily
observations from OMPS-LP (Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite Limb Profiler). The model simulated rate of ascent, hemispheric spread and residence time (or e-folding time) of the smoke aerosols in the stratosphere are in close
agreement with OMPS-LP observations. We found that both aerosol self-lofting and the large-scale atmospheric motion play important roles in lifting the smoke plumes from near the tropopause altitudes (~12 km) to about 22-23
km into the atmosphere. Further, our estimations of the radiative impacts of the pyroCb-emitted smoke aerosols showed that the smoke caused an additional warming of the atmosphere by about 0.6-1 W/m2 (zonal mean) that persisted for about 2-3 months after the injections in regions north of 40oN. The surface experienced a comparable
magnitude of cooling. The atmospheric warming is mainly located in the stratosphere, coincident with the location of the smoke plumes, leading to an increase in zonal mean shortwave (SW) heating rates of 0.02-0.04 K/day during
September 2017."

The GSPA is a scalable FPGA-based receiver which demodulates and decodes the DSOC downlink signal through novel signal processing algorithms implemented on Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs, as well as Python-based software monitor and control routines. Exploiting the unique TDC-based architecture, the GSPA supports over four orders of magnitude of downlink data rates across multiple orders of magnitude of signal and background powers.

The planetary protection process requires addressing the potential risks and would involve “breaking the chain of contact (BTC)”, where any returned material reaching Earth for further analysis would have to be sealed inside a container with extremely high confidence. The sterilization process would require destroying any potential biological materials that may contaminate the external surface of the container. A novel process for containing the returned samples has been conceived and developed at JPL. The process consists of using induction heated brazing to synchronously sterilize, separate, seam and seal the container. In this case. the braze material is heated to the level of melting at temperatures higher than 500°C to assure sterilizing exposed areas since carbon bonds are broken above this temperature. The container that encloses the samples consists of double walls with interstitial space that is Earth-clean. The process consists of two-steps, where one was intended to be prepared on Earth and the second potentially executed on orbit around Mars.  The latest results of this study that established the needed capability are described and discussed in this manuscript."

Since availability of semiconductor tunable monochromatic lasers is limited at short wavelengths, optical nonlinear processes are frequently used to produce the desirable radiation wavelength. Optical crystals with quadratic nonlinearity are promising for this purpose because of their transparency and high optical damage threshold. In this paper we discuss a possibility of generation of coherent deep UV light utilizing high quality factor (-Q) monolithic optical microcavities made of crystalline optical materials characterized with cubic nonlinearities. We show that the generation is feasible in spite of the relatively small cubic nonlinearities, due to the ultra-broad-band high optical transparency of the crystals and associated high-Q achievable in the cavities created out of the materials. We found that the birefringence as well as the tensor nature of the nonlinear susceptibility of the crystalline optical materials can simplify the phase matching of the nonlinear processes."

Juno ranged from 42°N to 51°N in magnetic latitude and 5.8–7.8 Jovian radii (1 RJ = 71,492 km) during this period. These dawn storm emissions consisted of two separate, elongated structures which extended into the nightside, rotated with the planet, had enhanced brightness (up to at least 1.4 megaRayleigh) and high color ratios. The color ratio is a proxy for the atmospheric penetration depth and therefore the energy of the electrons that produce the UV emissions. Juno observed electrons and ions on magnetic field lines mapping to these emissions. The electrons were primarily field-aligned, bidirectional, and, at times, exhibited sudden intensity decreases below ∼10 keV coincident with intensity enhancements up to energies of ∼1,000 keV, consistent with the high color ratio observations. The more energetic electron distributions had characteristic energies of ∼160–280 keV and downward energy fluxes (∼70–135 mW m−2) that were a significant fraction needed to produce the UV emissions for this event. Magnetic field perturbations up to ∼0.7% of the local magnetic field showing evidence of upward
and downward field-aligned currents, whistler mode waves, and broadband kilometric radio emissions were also observed along Juno's trajectory during this time frame. These high-latitude observations show similarities to those in the equatorial magnetosphere associated with dynamics processes such as interchange events, plasma injections, and/or tail reconnection."

This source shows a 35-day superorbital modulation in X-ray flux that is most likely caused by occultation by a warped, precessing accretion disk.  Our data set consists of four joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of Her X-1 which span a complete super orbital cycle.  However, We focus our analysis on the first and fourth observa-tion,  which occur during the bright “main-on” phase,  that have sufficient signal to noise to resolve pulsations.  In order to broaden our coverage of the superorbital cycle, we supplemented our weakly pulsed  observations  with  an  archival XMM-Newton observation  during  the  “short-on”  phase  of  the superorbital cycle.  We find that the energy-resolved pulse profiles show variations with superorbital phase and that pulse profiles from observations at similar superorbital phases show the same shape and relative phase, which we expect from a precessing disk.  We determine that the broad-band spectrum is well fit by an absorbed power law with a soft black body component.  We demonstrate that a simple precessing accretion disk model is sufficient to reproduce the observed pulse profiles.  The results of this model support the idea that the similarities in the observed pulse profiles are due to reprocessing by a precessing disk that has returned to its original precession phase.  We also present a brief analysis of the energy resolved light curves of a pre-eclipse dip, which shows soft X-ray absorption and hard X-ray variability during the dip."

Monitoring the state of droughts depends on integrating multiple indicators that each capture particular aspects of hydrologic impact and various types and phases of drought. As the capabilities of land surface models and remote sensing have improved, important physical processes such as dynamic, interactive vegetation phenology, groundwater, and snowpack evolution now support a range of drought indicators that better reflect coupled water, energy, and carbon cycle processes. In this work, we discuss these advances, including newer classes of indicators that can be applied to improve the characterization of drought onset, severity, and duration. We utilize a new model-based drought reconstruction to illustrate the role of dynamic phenology and groundwater in drought assessment. Further, through case studies on flash droughts, snow droughts, and drought recovery, we illustrate the potential advantages of advanced model physics and observational capabilities, especially from remote sensing, in characterizing droughts."

The version number corresponds to the particular design iteration, including major and minor changes that have been made throughout the design process. The catadioptric design is based on a reflective Cassegrain telescope configuration united with refractive tertiary components in order to approach a diffraction limited, laser beam expander communication transmitter. The configuration presented is intended to be used as an optical transmitter only. Optical design parameters, far-field beam propagations, optical component sensitivity studies, and design explorations are included to provide a high-level understanding of the beam expander’s basic design requirements and optical performance."

Unfortunately, the orbit design process for constellations can be significantly more involved, especiallywhen the relative placement of the individual spacecraft within the constellation is not constrained by mission and/or science objectives. Optimizing a satellite constellation in the presence of multiple, competing objectives is a highly complex problem to which many traditional mathematical optimization methods cannot be applied and few tools exist to help mission designers search for promising candidate mission designs. The Generation-based Evolutionary Tool for the Optimization of Constellations (GenETOC) has been created to search for near-optimal constellation design options. GenETOC combines a modified version of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) with STK Components libraries (a 3rdparty .NET package created by Analytical Graphics Inc.) to create a framework that enables a mission designer to generate a simulation that models the design problem and obtain a family of potential, near-optimal solutions that can be investigated more in detail."

Initial findings identified important SQ metrics as sharpness, tonality, and fluctuation strength. This document is a supplement to the initial findings in which the following are discussed: (i) a detailed treatment of the sound generation process, (ii) the impact of analyzing results with stimuli measured in the EER instead of the intended synthesized stimuli, (iii) an evaluation of annoyance responses with certification metrics, and (iv) adjunct analyses related to the test methodology."

The approach is similar to the author’s previous study, except now the oxidant is assumed to flow through the coating as oxygen ions via vacancies on the oxygen sublattice. The use of an “effective permeability” of the oxidant in the coating is required under the vacancy diffusion assumption. It is found that the linear-parabolic growth equation from Deal and Grove,   , is still applicable for the oxidation of the silicon bond coat, but the equation for the parameter A must be modified to account for the coating. The expression for B is the same as that obtained by Deal and Grove and thus is unaffected by the presence of a coating. The modified expression for A is a linear function of the coating thickness and includes the ratio of the oxidant permeability in the oxide to its effective permeability in the coating."

A scenario-based approach captures variability and uncertainty in the impacts with market adoption, aircraft design choices and regulatory scenarios, focusing on different overland flight restrictions. We find that the notional aircraft considered could attract a market of up to 2.5% of year-2035 seat-kilometers. Overland flight restrictions reduce this market by 80–100%. In comparison to subsonic aircraft, contrails are found to be ∼ 10 times less likely to form behind supersonic jets. A Mach 1.6 jet cruising at 17 km altitude causes 0.85 mDU of depletion per billion seat-km, with 54% of this impact attributable to sulfur emissions and 35% to NOx emissions. As a result, we find a net non-CO2, non-contrail radiative forcing of −0.020mWm−2 per billion seat-km. Long-term adjoint simulations show that net ozone-neutral cruise can be achieved by flying near 14 km, subject to fuel sulfur content and NOx emissions index."

In SSS missions, each type of job requires a group of vehicles to break off from the swarm for a given amount of time to service it. The required number of vehicles and the service rate are unique to each job type. Once a job has been completed, the vehicles are able to return to the swarm for use elsewhere. If not, enough vehicles are present in the swarm at the time that the job is identified, that job is dropped without being serviced. In SSS missions that occur in open environments, the arrival rate of jobs varies dynamically as vehicles move in and out of the swarm to service jobs. Human operators are tasked with effectively planning and managing these complex missions. This paper presents a user study that seeks to test the efficacy and ease-of-use of a prediction model known as the Hybrid Model as an aid in planning and monitoring tasks. Results show that the novel computational model aid allows operators to more effectively choose the necessary swarm size to handle expected mission workload, as well as, maintain sufficient situation awareness to evaluate the performance of the swarm during missions."

Test section  flow  angle  can  be  modulated  using  sinusoidally  oscillating  vanes  which  are  located  in  pairs  within  the contraction section of the tunnel circuit.  A compilation of previously published experimental data for validation has been reviewed that contains hot-wire anemometer and fast-response probe data acquired in an empty test section with the vanes oscillating in-phase and out-of-phase.  These experimental data have not previously been compared with computational results.  The present results provide an opportunity for validation of the simulations of the sinusoidal AOS flow field in the TDT test section.  Computed tunnel centerline, lateral and cross-section contour data of flow angle and vorticity show that resolving the vane tip vortex is critical to accurately predicting the test section center flow angle. The computed results show, as do the experimental data, what  appears  to  be  a  resonance  at  higher  frequencies.   It  is  currently  not  known  what  is  the  cause  of  that resonance. Further refinement of the mesh is expected to improve the comparisons with experimental data"

One possible solution to help reduce this risk is the addition of in situ produced supplemental fresh produce to supplement and enhance the astronaut diet.  A number of ground and ISS-based studies are being conducted which are helping to reduce this risk by filling the gaps in knowledge and technology associated with space crop production.   These include studies with the Veggie vegetable production system on the International Space Station.  Key focus areas include water and nutrient delivery, food safety and the crop microbiome, crop selection and testing, automation and robotics, radiation impacts, seed storage and handling, and scalability for different concepts and architectures.  All of these areas have significant challenges that need to be addressed prior to successful integration of crop production into the crew diet.  Data from these studies is feeding the development of new technologies and systems for space crop production.  This research was funded by NASA Space Biology and NASA’s Human Research Program."

NASHM is trained on historical variations in TC characteristics with two SST indices: global-tropical mean SST and the difference between tropical North-Atlantic (NA) SST and the rest of the global tropics, often referred to as “relative SST.” Testing confirms the model’s ability to reproduce historical US TC activity, as well as to make skillful predictions. When NASHM is driven by SST projections into the 2030s, overall NA annual TC counts increase, and the fractional increase is the greatest at the highest wind intensities. However, an eastward anomaly in mean TC tracks and an eastward shift in TC formation region result in a geographically-varied signal in US coastal activity. Florida’s Gulf coast is projected to see significant increases in TC activity, compared to the long-term historical mean, and these increases are fractionally greatest at the highest intensities. By contrast, the northwestern US Gulf and the US East Coast will see little change."

Three overarching themes emerged from the workshop and are presented with additional details:

•Machines made out of machines

•Active materials and metamaterials

This report lays out only some of the potential directions for soft matter dynamics over the next two decades. It also lays out the role that gravity plays in the organization of the basic building blocks of matter. Not only will research on soft matter have tremendous application towards understanding its behavior in our terrestrial environment, but also potentially in other NASA programs such as planetary science, exploration, robotics, etc."

At times, pilots do not comply with these criteria, perhaps owing to their conservative nature or complexity. This paper examines potential refinements to the continue-to-land decision from the combined results of three flight simulator experiments. Potential refinements include simplifying the number of parameters and lowering the altitude at which pilots make the decision. First, refinements were developed by evaluating pilots’ touchdown performance and qualitative data in a variety of starting and environmental conditions. Second, 30 of those pilots evaluated the refinements under several induced instabilities during the approach. The results showed little difference in touchdown performance when lowering the decision altitude from 500 to 300 ft; however, significant differences arose when the decision altitude was lowered further to 100 ft. The proposed new criteria include assessments of deviations in airspeed and position, no rate-of-descent audio warning, and having an appropriate engine setting at 1000, 500, and 300 ft height above threshold. Additionally, a recommendation is made that if the proposed criteria are not met at the 1000 or 500 ft height above threshold the pilots may make corrections and continue the approach; however, if the criteria are not met at 300 ft, then a go-around should be performed."

These data are best fit with the sum of two thermal plasma components in collisional ionization equilibrium and a power-law. We find cool (0.210±0.014keV) and hot (0.89±0.14keV) components. The LMC’s total X-ray luminosity is(1.08±0.14)×1039erg s−1.X-ray binaries make up a large fraction of the emission with a luminosity of(6.0±0.8)×1038ergs−1, followed by cool gas from superbubbles, supernovae, and diffuse emission with a luminosity of(3.0±0.3)×1038erg s−1. The hot gas from star formation contributes the smallest fraction, with a luminosity of(1.9±0.5)×1038erg s−1. We estimate the total volume of the cool gas to be between(0.2–1.2)×1010pc3and the hot gas to be between(1.0–5)×107pc3for filling factors off= 1and0.2. These volumes result in a total thermal energy for the cool gas between (1.4–3)×1054ergs for electron densities of 0.017–0.04 cm−3, and a thermal energy for the hot gas between (1.7–4)×1053ergs for electron densities of 0.12–0.3 cm−3.

The underlying multipolar topology, pre-eruption activities, and sequence of magnetic-reconnection onsets (first breakout, then flare) of many observed fast CMEs/eruptive flares are fully consistent with the model. Recently, we have demonstrated that most observed coronal-hole jets in fan/spine topologies also are induced by breakout reconnection at the null point above a filament channel (with or without a filament).For these two types of eruptions occurring in similar topologies, the key question is, why do some events generate jets while others form CMEs? We focused on the initiation of eruptions in large bright points/small active regions that were located in coronal holes and clearly exhibited null-point (fan/spine) topologies: such configurations are referred to as pseudostreamers. We analyzed and compared SDO/AIA,SOHO/LASCO, and RHESSI observations of three events. Our analysis of the events revealed two new observable signatures of breakout reconnection prior to the explosive jet/CME outflows and flare onset: coronal dimming and the opening-up of field lines above the breakout current sheet. Most key properties were similar among the selected erupting structures, thereby eliminating region size, photospheric field strength, magnetic configuration, and pre-eruptive evolution as discriminating factors between jets and CMEs. We consider the factors that contribute to the different types of dynamic behavior, and conclude that the determining factor is the ratio of the magnetic free energy associated with the filament channel compared to the energy associated with the overlying flux inside and outside the pseudostreamer dome. Our results imply that a pseudostreamer eruption must be fast in order to produce an interplanetary CME."

The flow conditions match selected test conditions from a recent wind tunnel experiment in the National Transonic Facility at the NASA Langley Research Center. Previous work involving parallel stability computations of a boundary layer flow based on the conical flow approximation has shown that the measured onset of laminar-turbulent transition during the experiments can be correlated with the linear amplification of Tollmien- Schlichting (TS) and stationary crossflow (CF) instabilities in the swept wing boundary layer. Here, we examine the effects of the simplifying approximations in both basic state computation and the stability analysis, with the goal of quantifying the resulting changes in the N-factor correlations. Specifically, the basic states are computed by using full Navier-Stokes equations and the stability analysis is performed by using a nonorthogonal coordinate system that allows a clear distinction between planar TS and CF instabilities. Furthermore, the effects of curvature and nonparallel mean flow have been included in the stability computations based on the parabolized stability equations (PSE). The fully turbulent Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) mean flow solutions show good agreement with the measured wall pressure distribution. Viscous-inviscid interactive effects are observed to be important because the shock fronts along the suction surface are influenced by the imposed transition front. The stability results confirm the previous findings related to TS amplification within the inboard region of the wing and the dominance of stationary CF modes in the outboard region. However, given the close proximity of the measured transition front and the dual shock system within the outer part of the wing, the onset of transition may well be shock limited within the outboard region. In general, the transition criterion based on the dual N-factor method with <i>N<sub>TS</sub> = N<sub>CF</sub></i> = 6 is reasonably successful at correlating with the measured transition fronts at <i>Re<sub>MAC</sub></i> = 15 million and <i>AoA</i> = 1.5, 2 degrees; however, the low values of the correlating N-factors at <i>Re<sub>MAC</sub></i> = 17.5 million support the hypothesis that the measured transition at the higher Reynolds number may have been strongly influenced by the merging of turbulent wedges that originate from surface imperfections near the leading edge."

These limitations are what motivates In-Space Assembly (ISA)and where Inertial Transfer has potential to improve or augment ISA capabilities by utilizing an efficient multi-agent autonomous system to transport untethered payloads. Adoption of an inertial transfer approach significantly reduces system complexity, energy and time needed for assembly compared to conventional ISA capabilities, increasing the likelihood of early adoption for assembly. The Inertial Transfer concept is presented including autonomy capabilities, potential risks, and three system configurations. These configurations are based on the autonomous system’s available sensor coverage that tracks the payload’s state. Participating agents have well-defined roles, expectations, and assumptions in their physical organization and coordination of actions depending the mode of operation. The sensor information available to participating agents is considered as it affects the uncertainty in the estimated state and theactions required to capture the payload."

The first is a more traditional open-jet configuration, where test section flow passes unbounded through the facility anechoic chamber. The second is a Kevlar® panel configuration, where a tensioned Kevlar sheet constrains the test section flow from the facility anechoic chamber. For both configurations, acoustic instrumentation is in the surrounding quiescent space. Both configurations are evaluated with a laser-based pulsed acoustic source, which provides unique capability for assessing the facility unsteady acoustic propagation characteristics. Metrics based on the wander and spread of the pulses are evaluated, and show that measurements using Kevlar walls experience dramatically reduced unsteady effects when compared to the open-jet configuration. This leads to a corresponding improvement in coherence between microphones with the Kevlar configuration, by reducing the variation in magnitude and phase differences between channels. Magnitude corrections for propagation through Kevlar as compared to open-jet propagation are calculated. Although limitations in the experimental setup make quantitative analysis difficult, qualitative analysis shows Kevlar magnitude corrections similar to those determined in previous literature. Directivity effects beyond those already present for open-jet configurations are minimal. When compared with the open-jet configuration, the background noise produced by the Kevlar is found to be its one drawback, showing significantly greater levels at high frequencies."

Two separate forecast runs using different PBL physics schemes were employed, and comparisons with 6 independent radiosonde profiles were made for each run.  Both of the forecast runs accurately predicted the PBLH and the state variable profiles within the planetary boundary layer during the early morning, and the assimilation had a small impact during this time.  In the late afternoon, the forecast runs showed decreased accuracy as the convective boundary layer developed.  However, assimilation of the Doppler lidar PBLH observations were found to improve the temperature and V velocity profiles relative to independent radiosonde profiles.  Water vapor was overcorrected, leading to increased differences with independent data.  Errors in the U velocity were made slightly larger.  The computed forecast error covariances between the PBLH and state variables were found to rise in the late afternoon, leading to the larger improvements in the afternoon.  This work represents the first effort to assimilate PBLH into forecast states using ensemble methods."

To support this capability, an updated ground infrastructure is required including modifying an existing Mobile Launcher system.  The Mobile Launcher is a very large heavy beam/truss steel structure designed to support the Space Launch System during its buildup and integration in the Vehicle Assembly Building, transportation between the Vehicle Assembly Building and launch pad 39B by the Crawler Transporter, and provides the launch platform at the launch pad.  As part of the Verification and Validation of the Mobile Launcher and Crawler Transporter, two rollouts of the Mobile Launcher transported by the Crawler Transporter, Integrated System Verification and Validation (ISVV) 005 and 010, have been performed to demonstrate the Crawler Transporter’s ability to transport the Mobile Launcher.  ISVV-005 occurred in September 2018 and ISVV-010 occurred in late June 2019.  ISVV-005 and ISVV-010 also provided the opportunity to gather data that can be used identify the Mobile Launcher on the Crawler Transporter rollout modal characteristics and refine the estimates of the Artemis I integrated launch vehicle rollout forcing functions.  While the rollout environment has historically produced relatively small launch vehicle structural loads for the Saturn/Apollo and Space Shuttle programs in comparison to launch and ascent loads, these relatively small structural loads are inputs to structural fatigue analyses.  The same holds true for the Space Launch System.  Because the rollout forces acting on the Mobile Launcher and the Crawler Transporter are not directly measurable, Operational Modal Analysis techniques, instead of traditional Experimental Modal Analysis techniques, provide an empirical means to identify the Mobile Launcher on the Crawler Transporter rollout modal characteristics.  The ISVV-010 rollout modal characteristics provide important supplemental modal information, which along with the Mobile Launcher modal test that was performed in June 2019 immediately prior to ISVV-010 rollout, combine to reduce uncertainty in the test correlated Mobile Launcher on the Crawler Transporter finite element model.  A well test correlated finite element model will play a key role in the Building Block approach the Space Launch System program has implemented as part of its certification process for the Artemis I flight and in refining the Artemis I rollout forcing functions.  At the time of the ISVV-005 rollout in September 2018, the Mobile Launcher was still undergoing construction, and therefore its modal characteristics are not directly comparable to those of the Mobile Launcher during the June 2019 Mobile Launcher modal test and subsequent ISVV-010 rollout.  Hence the ISVV-005 rollout modal characteristics will not be looked at in this paper.  This paper will briefly describe the Mobile Launcher and Crawler Transporter physical characteristics, ISVV-010 rollout data collection, the challenges in implementing Operational Modal Analysis techniques due in part to the Crawler Transporter harmonics, and how these challenges were overcome to obtain the ISVV-010 Mobile Launcher on the Crawler Transporter rollout modal characteristics."

Currently, agencies that monitor smoke base their decisions on an analysis of how fires burn, the direction the smoke moves from the fire source, and unverified estimates of mixing height. Mixing heights describe the maximum altitude to which a smoke plume rises. Satellite imagery provides more continuous and accurate coverage of mixing heights than current in situ methods. Thus, the team developed a software tool that processes and extracts mixing height observations from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Vertical Feature Mask granules. The team partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service, the Bureau of Land Management’s National Interagency Fire Center, and the National Park Service’s Fire Management Program Center to analyze historic fire events in southern Idaho. To do so, they used Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to verify where a CALIPSO pass intersects thermal anomalies and smoke plumes. The software extracts features of relevance from the hdf file of each CALIPSO transect to locate layers of continuous aerosols. The maximum altitude at which the aerosol ends is recorded as the mixing height, along with a matching latitude and longitude. The satellite-derived values can be used to validate past mixing height predictions and evaluate the accuracy and systematic bias of different estimation methods. These results may allow agencies to make better comparisons and subsequent smoke pollution management, prevention, and public health decisions if the spatial and temporal differences between predictions and observations can be resolved."

The approach taken had the industry partners propose a flight demonstration approximating a commercial operation, while NASA helped, as needed, the partners through design and test phases and NASA observed interactions with the FAA.  During this effort NASA collected best practices intended to be of value to similar UAS endeavors.  These best practices can be divided into different sets, including practices that describe the relationship between business considerations to UAS design or describe several UAS development challenges.  Another set includes best practices focused on navigating the UAS design and type certification processes.  A third set includes best practices that relate to the design of the DAA system. Deploying DAA systems in this timeframe posed unique challenges. Commercial off-the-shelf DAA systems do not exist, necessitating custom development and, for two of the partners, the use of low-size, -weight, and -power (SWaP) sensors not completely specified for DAA. A fourth set of best practices relates to lost-link contingency planning. The final set of best practices relates to the design and testing of C2 systems and obtaining spectrum licenses. The UAS demonstrations were piloted remotely, and for all aspects of flight safety, a C2 system was required to communicate DAA and other UAS subsystem data to the remote pilot and to allow the pilot to issue commands to the vehicle. Throughout the course of this effort, the partners integrated prototype DAA and C2 systems into unmanned aircraft, tested those systems, and laid the groundwork for type certification programs that are expected to continue."

Moreover, parachute deployment has been identified as one of the higher risk components for such missions. The analysis of textile fabrics used for atmospheric entry is inherently complex due to the multiple scales present in the fabric structure, including individual fiber filaments at the microscale, yarn bundles of fibers at the mesoscale, and the overall woven fabric at the macroscale. Computational tools for simulating fabric behavior must be able to account for the different mechanisms present at each scale without sacrificing computational efficiency. This work examines the generalized multiscale method of cells micromechanics theory, which has previously been used for the analysis of reinforced composite structures, to unreinforced textile fabrics. Modifications to the existing composite multiscale framework, implemented in NASA’s Multiscale Analysis Tool (NASMAT), include the specific mechanics unique to unreinforced textile fabrics, and overcoming the assumptions of a fixed fiber angle. It looks to assess the feasibility of using the NASMAT tool for efficient prediction of the response of unreinforced fabrics to loading such that it can ultimately be applied to fluid structure interaction tools for the prediction of parachute deployment systems. In this work, fabric behavior is simulated in NASMAT through homogenization of a triply periodic repeating unit cell, where the geometry of the subcells can change as a function of loading to represent the relative rotation and uncrimping that can occur in fabric tows. Predictions from the amended NASMAT code are compared to experimental data for uniaxial and off-axis tension to verify the ability of the code to incorporate lower-scale mechanics in prediction of unreinforced fabrics under loading."

The acoustic improvement modifications project included several large-scale tunnel loop modifications and reconstruction of the 9- by 15-Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel test section and diffuser to decrease the noise floor in the test section. Data were collected at three cross-sectional planes in the 9- by 15-ft test section using a 15-foot traversing calibration rake and a set of eight boundary layer rakes. The data from the characterization test were used to generate calibration relationships for facility operation and understand the flow quality in the new test section, including uniformity, flow angularity, turbulence intensity, and boundary layer characteristics. Additionally, the subsonic quick check rake was used to baseline the check calibration data set for the new test section."

In recent years object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been gaining in popularity for landslide mapping due to its ability to incorporate spectral, textural, morphological and topographical properties. Many studies have been conducted based on commercial software.  In this study, we create an open source Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system   utilizing OBIA and machine learning. Configured to run in Linux environment, it uses various opensource Python packages and modules. This system was tested in 575 km2 area along the Pasang Lhamu Highway, Nepal where large numbers of landslides were triggered by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Comparison with a manual inventory highlighted that this system was able to detect 70% of the landslide area. The speed and efficiency with which this system was able to detect landslides makes it a viable alternative to manual techniques for landslide mapping over large areas, when establishing approximate landslide locations is of prime importance."

However, the logistics of a particular flight (e.g., timing of the flight, timing of passenger service) and the pilot’s own physiology may mean that the last rest break isn’t always the best. To study this, we conducted a large survey of pilots flying these operations. Pilots completed the survey after eligible flights and provided us with information on which rest break they used, how much sleep they received, factors that disrupted sleep and ratings on the quality of their sleep, and they also provided fatigue and alertness ratings at top-of-descent. Pilots from another US-based carrier were also surveyed, in collaboration with our research partners at Washington State University, to increase the sample size and gather insights between operations."

This process is known as space weathering, and it alters  the  chemical,  microstructural,  and  optical properties  of  surface  regoliths  on  airless  bodies, including Mercury. On the Moon and S-type asteroids, the reflectance spectral signatures of space weathering include reddening   (increasing   reflectance   with increasing   wavelength), darkening   (lowering   of reflectance), and the attenuation  of  characteristic absorption bands [2]. Such spectral changes are driven by  the  production  of Fe-bearing  nanoparticles(npFe) through both solar wind irradiation and micrometeoroid bombardment. While our understanding of space weathering for the Moon  and  near-Earth  S-types  asteroids  is  advanced, insight  into  how  these  processes  operate  on  other planetary  bodies  is  limited.  In  particular,  Mercury experiences  a  uniquely  intense  space  weathering environment  than  planetary  counterparts  at  1  AU, including a  moreintense  solar  wind flux and higher velocity  micrometeoroid impacts  [4].  Additionally, Mercury has a surface composition unique in the inner solar system, including regions of the surface with very low  albedo known  as the  low  reflectance  material (LRM), which is enriched in carbon, likely graphite, up to 4wt.% [5].In addition, the concentration of Fe across Mercury’s  surface  islow  (<2 wt.%)  compared  to the Moonor   S-type   asteroids   asteroids[6]. Our understanding of the effects of space weathering on C-rich  and  Fe-poor  phases is  limited. Since Fe  plays  a critical  role  inthe  development  of  space  weathering characteristicson other airless surfaces(e.g., npFe), its limited   availability may   significantly   affect   the development of space weathering features in Mercury surface materials. We can simulate space weathering processes in the laboratory   to   explore   their   effects   on the microstructural, chemical, and  spectral  characteristics of Mercury surface materials[7]. Here we used pulsed laser  irradiation to  simulate  the  short  duration,  high-temperature  events  associated  with  micrometeoroid impacts. We performed coordinated analyses including reflectance  spectroscopy  and  electron  microscopy to investigate the spectral, chemical, and microstructural changes in these mercurian analog samples.

Methods: For these experiments, we usedforsteritic olivine  with  varying  FeOcontents,  a  mineral  phase proposed to be abundant on the surface of Mercury. We mixed  each  sample  with  graphite  to  simulate  LRM regions  of  the  surface.  Wesynthesized the  olivinesamplesat 1-bar at NASA’s Johnson Space Centerand prepared pressed powder pellets for laser irradiation [8].We prepared three samples, each with a base layer of olivineto maintain structural integrity and topped witha surface layer containing the graphite-olivine mixture: 1) Sample  SC-001 San  Carlos olivine(Fo90.91),2)Sample F-S-002 with0.05 wt.% FeO olivine, and 3) F-T-004 with 0.53 wt.% FeO olivine. Each sample was mixed  with  5  wt.%  powdered  graphite  and  had  grain sizes ranging from 45to 125μm. We irradiated each sample usinga pulsed Nd-YAG laser, (l=1064 nm, ~6 ns pulse duration, energy of 48 mJ/pulse) while undervacuumat Northern Arizona University. The laser was rastered1x and then 5x over the surfaceof each sample to simulate progressive space weathering. We collected in situreflectance spectra from the samples after each laser pulse witha  Nicolet  IS50 Fourier-Transform Infrared spectrometer (lfrom 0.65-2.5 μm). We used an FEI   Nova   NanoSEM200scanning   electron microscope  (SEM) and  a  Hitachi  TM4000  Plus benchtop  SEM at  Purdue  University  to  image  the surface morphology and topography of the samples. We extracted thin sections for analysis in the transmission electron  microscope(TEM)using  the  FEI  Helios NanoLab  660  focused  ion  beam  (FIB)  SEM  at  the University  of  Arizona.We  performed  analysis  of  the microstructural  and  chemical  characteristics  of  the samples using the 200 keV JEOL 2500 scanning TEM at Johnson Space Center.

Reflectance  Spectroscopy  Results:Reflectance spectra for each sample are shown in Fig. 1.SC-001:The  spectrum  of  the  unirradiated  sample exhibits a weak 1.0 μm absorption feature, associated with  Fe2+in  the  olivine,and  low  overall  reflectance (Fig.  1a). Thereflectance and  the  depth  of  the absorption band increases after 1x laser raster but are at their lowest after 5x laser rasters.F-T-004:The  unirradiated  sample  has  a  blue-sloped spectrum  with  low  reflectance without  identifiable absorption features  (Fig.  1b).  With  progressive  laser irradiation,  the sample reflectance  increases  and becomes strongly red-sloped.F-S-002:The unirradiated sample exhibits a dark, blue-slopedspectrum. The brightness of the sample increases significantly from <0.2average  reflectance  over >0.8 reflectance in  the  most irradiated  sampleand  thespectral slope also becomesslightly reddened (Fig. 1c).

Microstructural and  Chemical Analysis: Two primary alteration textures were observed in the samples exposed to simulated space weathering: 1) fluffy C-rich,and  2)  vesiculated  melt.  The  fluffy  C-rich  texture is composed oflow-densitydeposits distributed across the surface  of  the  sample(Fig.  2A).  Analysis  of  a  FIB section  extracted  from  a low-density C-rich  region  in sample SC-001 reveals multiple globule-type deposits, discrete  from  stacked  graphite,  likely  produced  via melting from the laser irradiation [9].The vesiculated  melt  textureis  smooth  and uniformly distributed  across isolated  regions  of  the sample surface. The vesicles measure up to 100s of nmin diameter. Analysis of a FIB section from this texture was extracted from sample F-T-004 reveals a layer of amorphous  melt  material,  close  to  100  nm  thick  and uniform  across  the  FIB  section  (Fig.  2B).  Isolated regions of this melt layer contain small nanoparticles, <5 nm in diameter. Chemical analysis through energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveals the composition of this layer is enriched in Si and depleted in Mg and O compared to the underlying sample.

Implications for Space Weathering on Mercury: Previous  experiments  simulating  space  weathering  of Mercury have  showndarkening  and  reddening  of spectra[7,10].However,  our use of low-Fe  materials and graphite to create a sample set more analogous to the mercurian surface. Our results indicate that sample composition plays a significant and important role in the space weathering of Mercury. In particular, our spectral data demonstrates a strong correlation between spectral slope,  Fe  content,  and  simulated  space  weathering. While the variation in FeO content between samples F-S-002  and  F-T-004  is  <0.6  wt.%,  the  spectra  deviate from  flat  to  strongly  red-sloped(F-T-004). This reddeningmay be linked to the presence of very small nanoparticles  observed  in  the  melt  textures  extracted from sample F-T-004. For the SC-001 sample, the fluffy C-rich textures may be developed by the amalgamation of   small   graphite   particles   into   these   unique morphologies.  Such  observations  indicate  that  space weathering on Mercury may result in both familiar and new microstructural and chemical characteristics.

This study compares monthly precipitation estimates from the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) with gauge observations from 37 low-lying atolls from the Pacific Rainfall Database for the period June 2000–August 2020. Over the analysis period, IMERG estimates are slightly higher than the atoll observations by 0.67% with a monthly correlation of 0.68. Seasonally, DJF shows excellent agreement with a near-zero bias, while MAM shows IMERG is low by 4.6%, and JJA is high by 1.2%. SON exhibits the worst performance, with IMERG overestimating by 6.5% compared to the atolls. The seasonal correlations are well contained in the range 0.67–0.72, with the exception of SON at 0.62. Furthermore, SON has the highest RMSE at 4.70 mm day^(−1), making it the worst season for all metrics. Scatterplots of IMERG versus atolls show IMERG, on average, is generally low for light precipitation accumulations and high for intense precipitation accumulations, with best agreement at intermediate rates. Seasonal variations exist at light and intermediate rate accumulations, but IMERG consistently overestimates at intense precipitation rates. The differences between IMERG and atolls vary over time but do not exhibit any discernible trend or dependence on atoll population. The PACRAIN atoll gauges are not wind-loss corrected, so application of an appropriate adjustment would increase the precipitation amounts compared to IMERG. These results provide useful insight to users as well as valuable information for future improvements to IMERG."

These interferometric measurements of CH3OH along with continuum emission from dust probed the inner coma(<2000 km from the nucleus)of 46P/Wirtanen approximately oneweek before its closest approach to Earth(∆= 0.089 – 0.092 au), revealing rapidly varying and anisotropic CH3OH outgassing during five separate ACA executions between UT 23:57 December 7 and UT 04:55 December 9,  with clear progression in the spectral line profilesover a timescaleofminutes.  We present spectrally integrated flux maps, production rates, rotational temperatures, andspectral  line  profiles  of  CH3OH  during  each  ACA  execution.   The  variations  in  CH3OH  outgassing are consistent with Wirtanen’s 9 hour nucleus rotational period derived from optical and millimeterwavelength measurements, and thus are likely coupled to the changing illumination of active sites onthe nucleus.  The consistent blue offset of the line center indicates enhanced CH3OH sublimationfromthe sunward hemisphere of the comet, perhaps from icy grains.  These results demonstrate theexceptional capabilities of the ACA for time-resolved measurements of comets such as 46P/Wirtanen."

This relationship spans multiple orders of magnitude in the aerosol extinction coefficient of stratospheric impact of  volcanic  events.  The  relationship  is  measurement-based and does not rely on assumptions about the aerosol size distribution. We note limitations on this analysis including that the presence of significant amounts of ash in the main sulfuric acid aerosol layer and other factors may significantly modulate these results. Despite these limitations, the findings suggest  an  avenue  for  improving  aerosol  extinction  coefficient  measurements  from  single-channel  observations  such as the Optical Spectrograph and Infrared Imager System as they  rely  on  a  prior  assumptions  about  particle  size.

The experience of Aquarius and SMOS in space led to the advanced detection system on SMAP. The fully polarimetric SMAP radiometer with spectral and time domain processing, provides sophisticated detection but also the opportunity to look at the temporal and spectral characteristics of the L-band RFI globally. The examples and categorization presented are based on a global sample but over a limited time. They are not meant to be complete.

Consequently, the small amount of geothermal heat that Earth’s bedrock releases can have a disproportionate role in controlling ice flow. Geothermal heat flux measurements beneath ice sheets are sparse, and models do not presently account for variable bed topography. Here, we present a simple statistical method for correcting geothermal heat flux models to make them consistent with known subglacial bed topography. This method is based on previous geothermal heat flux measurements across valleys and ridges, and it helps us explore the broader significance of geothermal heat flux variability beneath the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Our method can also be used to estimate the influence of topography on geothermal heat flux in non-ice-covered areas."

While land cover is frequently monitored over a large area using satellite data, ground-based reference data is valuable as a comparison point. The NASA-funded GLOBE Observer (GO) program provides volunteer-collected land cover photos tagged with location, date and time, and, in some cases, land cover type. When making a full land cover observation, volunteers take six photos of the site, one facing north, south, east, and west (N-S-E-W) respectively, one pointing straight up to capture canopy and sky, and one pointing down to document ground cover. Together, the photos document a 100 meter square of land. Volunteers may then optionally tag each N-S-E-W photo with the land cover types present. Volunteers collect the data through a smartphone app, also called GLOBE Observer, resulting in consistent data. While land cover data collected through GLOBE Observer is ongoing, this paper presents the results of a data challenge held between June 1 and October 15, 2019. Called “GO on a Trail,” the challenge focused on collecting land cover observations at designated points along the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail (LCNHT), which transects approximately 7,900 kilometers of the United States from east to west. The challenge also included an international component in which participants were recognized for the most data collected during the period. The challenge resulted in more than 2800 land cover data points from around the world with just over 900 land cover data points along the LCNHT. The data collected along the LCNHT is largely within a 1,000 meter corridor along the historic route. Internationally, the challenge had strong participation in Australia, where a Scouts Australia team-based competition was conducted in conjunction with GO on a Trail. GLOBE Observer collections can serve as reference data, ground truthing satellite imagery for the improvement and verification of broad land cover maps. Continued collection using this protocol will build a database documenting climate-related land cover and land use change into the future."

Many dust models used constant threshold values globally. Here we use satellite products to characterize the frequency of dust events and land surface properties. By matching this frequency derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue aerosol products with surface winds, we are able to retrieve a climatological monthly global distribution of the wind erosion threshold (V(threshold)) over dry and sparsely vegetated surfaces. This monthly two-dimensional threshold velocity is then implemented into the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory coupled land–atmosphere model (AM4.0/LM4.0). It is found that the climatology of dust optical depth (DOD) and total aerosol optical depth, surface PM10 dust concentrations, and the seasonal cycle of DOD are better captured over the “dust belt” (i.e., northern Africa and the Middle East) by simulations with the new wind erosion threshold than those using the default globally constant threshold. The most significant improvement is the frequency distribution of dust events, which is generally ignored in model evaluation. By using monthly rather than annual mean V(threshold), all comparisons with observations are further improved. The monthly global threshold of wind erosion can be retrieved under different spatial resolutions to match the resolution of dust models and thus can help improve the simulations of dust climatology and seasonal cycles as well as
dust forecasting."

Quantifying the global carbon stock of coastal salt marshes, potentially the most efficient carbon-burying ecosystems in the world per area, is a key area of further research in both of these fields Pendleton et al., 2012. One of the largest challenges is that despite the fact that salt marshes often sequester carbon several meters deep, nearly all estimates of salt marsh carbon stocks consider only the upper 1 m of sediment (Windham-Myers et al., 2015) [54]. This is particularly concerning because coastal wetlands are increasingly at risk due to climate change, sea level rise, and anthropogenic disturbance and destruction (Deegan et al., 2012) [15]. Using full-depth measurements from marsh cores, we estimate the carbon stock of five salt marshes in the highly urbanized estuary of Jamaica Bay, New York and argue that partial-depth measurements can underestimate carbon stocks. These estimates use calculated carbon content and probe depth data of these marshes collected between 2000 and 2019, applying this data across the full area of the marsh obtained from satellite imagery. Carbon density measurements are then multiplied by the full-depth volume of the marshes to create an estimate of total carbon stock. In addition to calculating present-day estimates, we compare our carbon stock estimates to historical Jamaica Bay imagery to calculate historical carbon stocks and carbon loss. The carbon stock estimates presented here show a 95% carbon stock loss between 1885 and 2019 in Jamaica Bay and highlight the severe underestimation of carbon stocks without full-depth calculations. These findings have important implications for disappearing salt marshes with regard to the global carbon cycle and the incorporation of belowground carbon into global climate models. The findings are increasingly relevant for advocacy efforts aiming to conserve these marshes with sea level rise."

Stone Memorial St. Joseph Peninsula State Park experienced significant damages from Hurricane Michael in 2018, the first Category 5 hurricane to hit the contiguous United States since 1992. These damages included a 300-meter-wide and 10-meter-deep breach in the peninsula, habitat disruption, and a forced closure of over half of the total park area. These damages, coupled with restricted visitor access, resulted in a significant loss of revenue for the park. NASA DEVELOP partnered with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to determine the overall impact of Hurricane Michael on land cover and shoreline change by using NASA Earth observations including Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) to analyze sediment transport and climatology to further understand the lasting impacts of hurricanes on the ecosystems of the park. The DEVELOP team’s analyses showed that chlorophyll-a concentrations, sea surface temperature, and precipitation are increasing over time. The sediment transport analysis showed dynamic movement across the peninsula, with the greatest erosion occurring within the bay and along the length of the peninsula. These results are supported by evidence of declining seagrass abundances and seasonal turbidity patterns within those areas. Providing these analyses for the partner allows for a greater understanding of how best to proceed with restoration efforts, which may include rebuilding camping services, expanding fishing recreation, and conserving habitats for endangered species."

In this paper, we seek to understand the most important predictors of alertness over the course of a space mission, using self-reported, cognitive, and environmental data collected from 24 astronauts on 6-month missions to the International Space Station (ISS). Alertness was repeatedly and objectively assessed on the ISS with a brief 3-minute Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) that is highly sensitive to sleep deprivation. To relate PVT performance to time-varying and sparsely-measured environmental, operational, and psychological covariates, we propose a n ensemble prediction model comprising of linear mixed effects regression, random forest, and functional concurrent regression models. An extensive cross-validation procedure reveals that this ensemble outperforms any one of its components   alone. We also discover that a participant’s past performance, reported fatigue and stress, and temperature and radiation exposure were among the most important variables associated with alertness. This method is broadly applicable to environmental studies where the main goal is accurate, individualized prediction involving a mixture of person-level traits and irregularly measured time series."

We express gravity as gridded gravity anomalies on a sphere, and we estimate adjustments to a background global start model expressed in spherical harmonics. We processed GRAIL Ka-band range-rate data with a short-arc approach, using only data over the area of interest. We determine our gravity solutions using neighbor smoothing constraints. We divided the entire Moon into twelve regions and two polar caps, with a resolution of 0.15˚ x 0.15˚ (which is equivalent to degree and order 1199 in spherical harmonics), and determined the optimal smoothing parameter for each area by comparing localized correlations between gravity and topography for each solution set. Our selected areas share nodes with surrounding areas and they are overlapping. To mitigate boundary effects, we patch the solutions together by symmetrically omitting the boundary parts of overlapping solutions. Our new solution has been iterated, and it has improved correlations with topography when compared to a fully iterated global model. Our method requires fewer resources, and can easily handle regionally varying resolution or constraints. The smooth model describes small-scale features clearly, and can be used in local studies of the structure of the lunar crust."

Crew health and comfort is ensured by controlling human produced CO2 (1 kg person-1 day-1) and water vapor (~2 kg person-1 day-1), and by removing trace contaminants (TCs) from cabin air. These life support functions on-board the International Space Station (ISS) are carried out by the Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA), the Water Processor Assembly (WPA), and the trace contaminant control system (TCCS).

During the development of the TCCS, new analytical and theoretical methods were developed in the 1970s for characterizing adsorption and desorption characteristics of activated carbons for the purpose of designing suitable AR technologies required for controlling airborne trace contaminants within spacecraft cabins during long exploration missions. The TCCS removes harmful volatile organic compounds and other trace contaminants from the circulating air. It consists of a granular activated carbon (GAC) bed for the removal of high molecular weight contaminants and ammonia followed by a heated catalytic bed for low molecular weight hydrocarbons. The high temperature catalytic oxidizer (HTCO) of the TCCS, which operates at 400°C and requires 120W average power, removes low molecular weight compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (CH2O), and methane (CH4), that pass through the GAC bed.

The Air Revitalization Laboratory at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) was established to develop new analytical methods for evaluating emerging ECLSS technologies for use in future AR architectures. General properties of adsorbents and catalysts are required for trace contaminant control system design calculations and vendor-supplied data are seldom available at relevant process conditions of interest to spacecraft cabin applications. To address this shortcoming, appropriate testbeds were developed to measure the desired properties of AR technologies being considered for use in ECLS architectures. Generally, the testbeds developed at KSC challenge the test media (activated carbon, impregnated activated carbon, catalysts, zeolites, solid amines, or pleated filters) with simulated spacecraft gas streams containing representative mixtures of trace contaminants (volatile organic compounds, ammonia, CO, CO2, or siloxanes) at the flow rates, temperatures, and relative humidity that will be encountered within manned spacecraft.

Work performed at KSC funded by NASA’s Advanced Exploration (AES) Program has included: Identifying candidate sorbents to replace commercially obsolete impregnated carbons for NH3 control within the TCCS, characterizing their adsorptive capacities using simulated spacecraft gas streams, and ranking their appropriateness in various AR applications; evaluating novel low temperature catalysts for controlling CO and formaldehyde by traditional and photocatalytic methods for trace contaminant control;  development of analytical methods to assess regenerable solid amine performance for CO2 control via pressure swing adsorption.

The Air Revitalization lab was also funded to study trace contaminant control by other NASA programs. These include: screening of candidate sorbents for the design of new Charcoal HEPA Integrated Particle Scrubber (CHIPS) filters for removing siloxanes from cabin air; characterizing the performance of an impregnated activated carbon at low humidity for use in ORION ECLS; screening of sorbents for protecting the Sabatier 2.0 catalyst from DMSO2, siloxanes, NH3, and solid amine byproducts."

This study investigates the potential of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for snowfall retrieval in HL using CloudSat radar information and machine learning (ML). With all the known limitations, AVHRR observations should be considered for HL snowfall retrieval because 1) AVHRR data have been continuously collected for about four decades on multiple platforms with global coverage, and similar observations will likely continue in the future; 2) current passive microwave satellite precipitation products have several issues over snow and ice surfaces; and 3) good coincident observations between AVHRR and CloudSat are available for training ML algorithms. Using ML, snowfall rate was retrieved from AVHRR’s brightness temperature and cloud probability, as well as auxiliary information provided by numerical reanalysis. The results indicate that the ML-based retrieval algorithm is capable of detection and estimation of snowfall with comparable or better statistical scores than those obtained from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and two passive microwave sensors contributing to the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission constellation. The outcomes also suggest that AVHRR-based snowfall retrievals are spatially and temporally reasonable and can be considered as a quantitatively useful input to the merged precipitation products that require frequent sampling or long-term records."

Enstatite chondrite meteorites have highly reduced and anhydrous compositions, and their bulk isotopic compositions closely resemble terrestrial values, suggesting that their parent body asteroids accreted within the inner protoplanetary disk and were a primary contributor during Earth’s late accretion (Javoy et al., 1995; Piani et al., 2020). Here, we present the first report of amino acids in enstatite chondrite meteorite samples. Three EH3 meteorites were analyzed (Dominion Range 14021, Larkman Nunatak 12001, and Larkman Nunatak 06252). The acid-hydrolyzed water extracts of the meteorites contained low abundances (1.5 – 215.9 pmol/g) of n-ω-amino acids (glycine, β-alanine, γ-amino-n-butyric acid (γ-ABA), δ-amino-n-valeric acid (δ-AVA), and ε-amino-n-caproic acid (ε-ACA)), but amino acids were not present above detection limits in the non-hydrolyzed samples. The low amino acid abundances and the predominance of n-ω-amino acids resembles amino acid distributions previously observed for thermally altered chondrites. These results suggest that the parent body asteroid was not conducive to the synthesis and/or preservation of α-amino acids, or free amino acids in general, and that EH3 chondrite-like material may not have been a primary contributor of diverse or abundant free amino acids to the early Earth."

The underpinnings are long-established probability surveys reliant on farmers’ feedback in parallel with biophysical measurements. Over the last decade though, satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been used to corroborate the survey information. This is facilitated through the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies/Global Agricultural Monitoring system, which  provides  open  access  to  pertinent  real-time  normalized  difference  vegetation  index (NDVI) data. Hence, two relatively straightforward MODIS-based modeling methods are employed operationally. The first model constitutes mid-season timing based on the maximum peak NDVI value, while the second is reflective of late-season timing by integrating accumulated NDVI over a threshold value. Corn model results nationally show the peak NDVI method provides a R^(2) of 0.88 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 3.5%. The accumulated method, using an optimally derived 0.58 NDVI threshold, improves the performance to 0.93 and 2.7%, respectively. Both these models outperform simple trend analysis, which is 0.48 and 7.4%, correspondingly. For soybeans the R^(2) results of the peak NDVI model are 0.62, and 0.73 for the accumulated using a 0.56 threshold. CVs are 6.8% and 5.7%, respectively. Spring wheat’s R2performance with the accumulated NDVI model is 0.60 but just 0.40 with peak NDVI. The soybean and spring wheat models perform similarly to trend  analysis.  Winter  wheat  and  upland  cotton  show  poor  model  performance,  regardless  of method. Ultimately, corn yield forecasting derived from MODIS imagery is robust, and there are circumstances when forecasts for soybeans and spring wheat have merit too."

Evaluating and improving biodiversity predictions to better inform policy decisions remains a central conservation goal and challenge. A comprehensive strategy to evaluate and reduce uncertainty of model outputs against observed measurements and multiple models would help to produce more robust biodiversity predictions. We propose an approach that integrates biodiversity models and emerging remote sensing and in-situ data streams to evaluate and reduce uncertainty with the goal of improving policy-relevant biodiversity predictions. In this article, we describe a multivariate approach to directly and indirectly evaluate and constrain model uncertainty, demonstrate a proof of concept of this approach, embed the concept within the broader context of model evaluation and scenario analysis for conservation policy, and highlight lessons from other modeling communities."

However, a baseline for forest stature and biomass estimates has yet to be established for the wide array of available remote sensing products. At present, it remains unclear how the estimates from these sensors compare to one another in terrestrial forests, with a clear dearth of studies in high carbon density mangrove ecosystems. In the tallest mangrove forest on Earth (Pongara National Park, Gabon), we leverage the data collected during the AfriSAR campaign to evaluate 17 state-of-the-art sensor data products across the full range of height and biomass known to exist globally in mangrove forest ecosystems, providing a much-needed baseline for sensor performance. Our major findings are: (Houghton, Hall, Goetz) height estimates are not consistent across products, with opposing trends in relative and absolute errors, highlighting the need for an adaptive approach to constraining height estimates (Panet al., 2011); radar height estimates had the lowest calibration error and bias, with further improvements using LiDAR fusion (Bonan, 2008); biomass variability and uncertainty strongly depends on forest stature, with variation across products increasing with canopy height, while relative biomass variation was highest in low-stature stands (Le Quéréet al., 2017); a remote sensing product's sensitivity to variations in canopy structure is more important than the absolute accuracy of height estimates (Mitchardet al., 2014); locally-calibrated area-wide totals are more representative than generalized global biomass models for high-precision biomass estimates. The findings presented here provide critical baseline expectations for height and biomass predictions across the full range of mangrove forest stature, which can be directly applied to current (TanDEM-X, GEDI, ICESat-2) and future (NISAR, BIOMASS) global-scale forest monitoring missions."

This includes adding both measured spectral AOD and sky radiances at 380 nm and 500 nm to the four channels (440, 675, 870 and 1020 nm) that are used in the standard retrieval data product. The vector radiative transfer code in the AERONET Version 3 retrievals enabled more accurate computations in the ultraviolet region (380 nm). Calibration of the 380 nm channel radiances was done by the vicarious method since the integrating sphere radiance source that is used for all other wavelengths does not produce sufficient energy at 380 nm. Spectral single scattering albedo, imaginary refractive indices and aerosol size distributions from these six wavelength retrievals are compared to the standard four wavelength retrieval values."

Designing for the demands that extreme environments such as wild temperature fluctuations, galactic cosmic rays, destructive dust, meteoroid impacts (direct or indirect), vibrations, and solar particle events, will place on long-term deep space habitats represents one of the greatest challenges in this endeavor. This context necessitates that we establish the know-how and technologies to build habitat systems that are resilient. Resilience is not simply robustness or redundancy: it is a system property that accounts for both anticipated and unanticipated disruptions via the design choices and maintenance processes, and adapts to them in operation. We currently lack the frameworks and technologies needed to achieve a high level of resilience in a habitat system. The Resilient Extra Terrestrial Habitats Institute (RETHi) has the mission of leveraging existing novel technologies to provide situational awareness and  autonomy to enable the design of habitats that are able to adapt, absorb and rapidly recover from expected and unexpected disruptions. We are establishing both fully virtual and coupled physical-virtual simulation capabilities that will enable us to explore a wide range of potential deep space Smart Hab configurations and operating modes."

Smectite clay minerals are common products of water-rock interactions throughout the solar system, and their detection and characterization provides important clues about geochemical conditions and past environments if sufficient information about their composition can be discerned. Here, we synthesize and report on the spectroscopic properties of a suite of smectite samples that span the intermediate compositional range between Fe(II), Fe(III), Mg, and Al end-member species using bulk chemical analyses, X-ray diffraction, Vis/IR reflectance spectroscopy, UV and green-laser Raman spectroscopy, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Our data show that smectite composition and the oxidation state of octahedral Fe can be reliably identified in the near infrared on the basis of combination and fundamental metal-OH stretching modes between 2.1–2.9 μm, which vary systematically with chemistry. Smectites dominated by Mg or Fe(III) have spectrally distinct fundamental and combination stretches, whereas Al-rich and Fe(II)-rich smectites have similar fundamental minima near 2.76 μm, but have distinct combination M-OH features between 2.24 and 2.36 μm. We show that with expanded spectral libraries that include intermediate composition smectites and both Fe(III) and Fe(II) oxidation states, more refined characterization of smectites from MIR data is now possible, as the position of the 450 cm–1 absorption shifts systematically with octahedral Fe content, although detailed analysis is best accomplished in concert with other characterization methods. Our data also provide the first Raman spectral libraries of smectite clays as a function of chemistry, and we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy at multiple excitation wavelengths can qualitatively distinguish smectite clays of different structures and can enhance interpretation by other types of analyses. Our sample set demonstrates how X-ray diffraction can distinguish between dioctahedral and trioctahedral smectites using either the (02,11) or (06,33) peaks, but auxiliary information about chemistry and oxidation state aids in specific identifications. Finally, the temperature-dependent isomer shift and quadrupole splitting in Mössbauer data are insensitive to changes in Fe content but reliability differentiates Fe within the smectite mineral structure."

In the absence of PMW observations, IMERG uses a Kalman filter scheme to morph precipitation from one PMW observation to the next. In this study, an analysis of convective systems observed during the Convective Process Experiment (CPEX) suggests that IMERG precipitation depends more strongly on the availability of PMW observations than previously suspected. Following this evidence, we explore systematic biases in IMERG through bulk statistics. In two CPEX case studies, cloud photographs, pilot’s radar, and infrared imagery suggest that IMERG represents the spatial extent of precipitation relatively well when there is a PMW observation but sometimes produces spurious precipitation areas in the absence of PMW observations. Also, considering an observed convective system as a precipitation object in IMERG, the maximum rain rate peaked during PMW overpasses, with lower values between them. Bulk statistics reveal that these biases occur throughout IMERG Version 06. We find that locations and times without PMW observations have a higher frequency of light precipitation rates and a lower frequency of heavy precipitation rates due to retrieval artifacts. These results reveal deficiencies in the IMERG Kalman filter scheme, which have led to the development of the Scheme for Histogram Adjustment with Ranked Precipitation Estimates in the Neighborhood (SHARPEN; described in a companion paper) that will be applied in the next version of IMERG."

This proposed system offers a combined thermal and electrical power source to support survival of spacecraft operating in extreme low temperature lunar environments, without the use of radioisotope-based sources. A conceptual design study has been completed for this system, that uses heat generated by an exothermic chemical reaction in place of radioisotope or electrical heat sources. The goal of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of such as system through thermodynamic and chemical analysis and thermal modeling, and to identify technology gaps to inform a technology development and maturation plan. The specific technical objectives focused on delivery of 90-100 Wth thermal power and 30-40 We electrical power for 336 hours to a representative Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) lander, to support lunar surface survival and limited operations through a lunar night. The total system mass was targeted at ≤50 kg. A highly exothermic chemical reaction system is used to generate on-board electrical power for spacecraft systems, and thermal power to maintain critical spacecraft/lander systems within their allowable flight temperature (AFTs). Based on the very high energy content of the chemical reaction system, a much higher amount of heat per unit mass can be delivered to the spacecraft, relative to a rechargeable lithium-ion battery and electrical heater(s). Since radioisotope heaters or generators are not used, the system will be orders of magnitude lower in cost than a radioisotope heating/power unit, without the attendant regulatory complexities. As part of the CHIPS concept, a fraction of the thermal power generated is converted to electrical power via an appropriate thermal-to-electric converter technology (such as a free piston Stirling converter or a thermoelectric generator module), to provide power to critical loads. This approach is ideally suited to support operation of commercial landers (e.g., via the CLPS program). In most cases, these landers are only designed to operate during a portion of the lunar day, with no provision for survival through the lunar night. By supporting lunar night survival, a mission can be extended through the lunar night and at least into another lunar day, thus turning a nominal eight-day mission into a 36-day mission. Therefore, the current system demonstration will focus on scalability to support at least 336 hours (one lunar night) of continuous thermal and electrical power generation. Although initially targeted to support lunar equatorial landings, the technology is extensible to missions at the lunar poles, other extreme environments in the Solar System or even air-independent applications on Earth (e.g., ocean exploration)."

Since the landing, the rover’s activities have been planned with the aid of a ground-based automated scheduling system called Copilot. Automated scheduling is very rare for planetary rover missions. Historically humans have created a schedule manually and ensured that the schedule satisfied all constraints. Higher levels of automation in the system allows science planners to produce schedules for the rover more quickly. In addition to scheduling user-provided activities, Copilot generates and schedules two types of support activities: sleep activities and heating activities. Some activities require the CPU to be on as they execute, so Copilot schedules wakeups and shutdowns of the CPU at the appropriate times. Some activities require areas of the rover to be heated before they can execute, and that heating must be maintained throughout the duration of the activity. Copilot schedules the preheat and maintenance heating activities for the user-provided activities that require them.  To facilitate Copilot usage, the Crosscheck tool shows the science planners how Copilot constructed a schedule. For activities that fail to be scheduled, Crosscheck gives information on the constraints that the activity would have violated. This gives the users insight into how to change the input activities and constraints in order to achieve a schedule that satisfies their goals."

This instability is dominant in the transient phase of the system and it does not appear in the steady-state behavior of the system, as each agent uses Lyapunov-stable feedback control laws. We present a rigorous definition of transient instability in swarms, and discuss its key properties. We also present a sufficient condition to check if a swarm will be transient stable. Using both theoretical techniques and numerical results, we show that a simple Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) feedback-tracking control law is not suitable for these applications. We also present a robust control law for Euler- Lagrangian systems that maintains transient stability across static swarms or time-varying reconfiguration in swarms. Both theoretical results and numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."

Yet, state-of-the-art VIO is still very failure- prone, which can have dramatic consequences. To prevent this, VIO must be able to re-initialize in mid-air, either during a free fall or on a constant horizontal velocity trajectory after attitude control has been re-established. However, for both of these trajectories, the visual scale cannot be observed with VIO batch initializers because of the absence of acceleration change. We propose to use a small and lightweight laser range finder and a scene facet model to initialize vision-based navigation at the right scale under any motion condition and over any scene structure. This new range constraint is integrated into a visual-inertial bundle adjustment initializer. We demonstrate in simulation and real data how this approach can address mid-air state estimation failure in real-time and analyze the sensitivity of estimators to initial state errors."

As an indirect measurement, most ALS methods to estimate LAI combine waveform or point density information with supporting field measurements such as the leaf angle distribution, gap probability, or direct LAI measures. The development of a more independent estimation approach would facilitate more widespread use of existing ALS data to investigate patterns of forest structure and build realistic 3-D vegetation scenes to simulate remote sensing imagery and energy balance. Here, we develop a data processing workflow (named PVlad) using ALS point cloud apparent reflectance to estimate LAI and voxel-based leaf area density (LAD), aiming to reduce the need for associated field measurements such as the gap probability. The adaptation of the path volume (PV) concept derived from apparent reflectance integrates information from multi-directional ALS pulses, and quantifies the percentage exploration of each voxel for classification and occlusion correction, such that rigorous volumetric sampling approaches can be developed to derive LAI and LAD. The PVlad workflow was applied to discrete-return lidar data (Riegl VQ480i) acquired by NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Thermal Imager (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager during leaf-on (summer) and leaf-off (spring) conditions at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC). The estimates of LAI and LAD captured structural differences between mature, logged, and intermediate-aged stands over eight deciduous forest plots. The derived LAI values were compared to field litter collection measurements, and the derived LAD vertical distribution was compared to the output of the VoxLAD model using terrestrial laser scan (TLS) field survey data. Using voxel sizes ranging from 0.5 m to 5 m, overall LAI estimation showed linear fitting coefficient bias  and  for 1 and 2 m voxel sizes, and vertical LAD distribution showed strong correlation with  and  for 0.5 and 1m voxel sizes. For every forest stand, upper-canopy LAD had a low variance for voxel sizes of ≤ . Application of PVlad to the G-LiHT and other similar ALS data archives enables the development of fine-resolution LAI map products, including voxelization of LAD for ecosystem science and radiative transfer simulations of remote sensing imagery or surface energy balance."

However, LiDAR-derived forest inventories have remained uncommon at a regional scale due to varying parameters among LiDAR data acquisitions and the availability of sufficient calibration data. Here, we present a model using a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN), a form of deep learning capable of scanning a LiDAR point cloud, combined with coincident satellite data (spectral, phenology, and disturbance history). We compared this approach to traditional modeling used for making forest predictions from LiDAR data (height metrics and random forest) and found that the CNN had consistently lower uncertainty. We then applied the CNN to public data over six New England states in the USA, generating maps of 14 forest attributes at a 10 m resolution over 85% of the region. Aboveground biomass estimates produced a root mean square error of 36 Mg ha−1 (44%) and were within the 97.5% confidence of independent county-level estimates for 33 of 38 or 86.8% of the counties examined. CNN predictions for stem density and percentage of conifer attributes were moderately successful, while predictions for detailed species groupings were less successful. The approach shows promise for improving the prediction of forest attributes from regional LiDAR data and for combining disparate LiDAR datasets into a common framework for large-scale estimation."

Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events. Mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, are primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Freshwater availability and temperature affect dengue vector populations via a variety of biological processes and thus influence the ability of mosquitoes to effectively transmit disease. However, the effect of droughts, floods, heat waves, and cold waves is not well understood. Using vector, climate, and dengue disease data collected between 2013 and 2019 in Kenya, this retrospective cohort study aims to elucidate the impact of extreme rainfall and temperature on mosquito abundance and the risk of arboviral infections. To define extreme periods of rainfall and land surface temperature (LST), we calculated monthly anomalies as deviations from long-term means (1983–2019 for rainfall, 2000–2019 for LST) across four study locations in Kenya. We classified extreme climate events as the upper and lower 10% of these calculated LST or rainfall deviations. Monthly Ae. aegypti abundance was recorded in Kenya using four trapping methods. Blood samples were also collected from children with febrile illness presenting to four field sites and tested for dengue virus using an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found that mosquito eggs and adults were significantly more abundant one month following an abnormally wet month. The relationship between mosquito abundance and dengue risk follows a non-linear association. Our findings suggest that early warnings and targeted interventions during periods of abnormal rainfall and temperature, especially flooding, can potentially contribute to reductions in risk of viral transmission"
3018,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220006524,2023-08-03,Satellite Constraints on the Latitudinal Distribution and Temperature Sensitivity of Wetland Methane Emissions,"Wetland methane (CH4) emissions comprise about one-third of the global CH4 source. The latitudinal distribution and climate sensitivity of wetland CH4 fluxes are the key determinants of the global CH4-climate feedback. However, large differences exist between bottom-up estimates, informed by ground-based flux measurements, and top-down estimates derived from spaceborne total column CH4. Despite the extensive coverage of satellite CH4 concentration observations, challenges remain with using top-down estimates to test bottom-up models, mainly because of the uncertainties in the satellite retrievals, the model representation errors, the variable prior emissions, and the confounding role of the posterior error covariance structures. Here, we use satellite-based top-down CH4 flux estimates (2010–2012) to test and refine 42 bottom-up estimates of wetland emissions that use a range of hypothesized wetland extents and process controls. Our comparison between bottom-up models and satellite-based fluxes innovatively accounts for cross-correlations and spatial uncertainties typically found in top-down inverse estimates, such that only the information from satellite observations and the atmospheric transport model is kept as a constraint. We present a satellite-constrained wetland CH4 ensemble product derived from assembling the highest-performance bottom-up models, which estimates global wetland CH4 emissions of 148 (117–189, 5th–95th percentile) Tg CH4 yr−1. We find that tropical wetland emissions contribute 72% (63%–85%) to the global wetland total. We also find that a lower-than-expected temperature sensitivity agrees better with atmospheric CH4 measurements. Overall, our approach demonstrates the potential for using satellites to quantitatively refine bottom-up wetland CH4 emission estimates, their latitudinal distributions, and their sensitivity to climate."

The causes of the renewed increase of methane concentration since 2007 are uncertain given the multiple sources and complex biogeochemistry. Here, we present a metadata analysis of methane fluxes from all major natural, impacted and human-made aquatic ecosystems. Our revised bottom-up global aquatic methane emissions combine diffusive, ebullitive and/or plant-mediated fluxes from 15 aquatic ecosystems. We emphasize the high variability of methane fluxes within and between aquatic ecosystems and a positively skewed distribution of empirical data, making global estimates sensitive to statistical assumptions and sampling design. We find aquatic ecosystems contribute (median) 41% or (mean) 53% of total global methane emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources. We show that methane emissions increase from natural to impacted aquatic ecosystems and from coastal to freshwater ecosystems. We argue that aquatic emissions will probably increase due to urbanization, eutrophication and positive climate feedbacks and suggest changes in land-use management as potential mitigation strategies to reduce aquatic methane emissions."

As was consistently shown during the Apolloprogram, the very fine granular structure of the lunar regolith (the Moon’s “soil”) poses significantphysical and health challenges [1]. One of the most concerning is the hyper-velocity lunarsurface ejecta that results from the engine exhaust that exits the rocket as it lands and takes off[2]. It has been determined that to mitigate this, the regolith must be consolidated."

A fundamental building block in most multi-robot systems is dynamic task allocation: assigning robots to tasks (e.g., patrolling an area, or servicing a transportation request) as they appear based on the robots’ states to maximize reward. In many practical situations, the allocation must account for potentially heteroge- neous capabilities (e.g., availability of appropriate sensors or actuators) to ensure the feasibility of execution, and exploit predictive information concerning the likelihood of future tasks to promote a higher reward over a long time horizon. To this end, we present an efficient algorithm for predictive heterogeneous task- allocation achieving an approximation factor of at least 1/2 of the optimal reward. Our approach demonstrates that the problem can be decomposed into several homogeneous subproblems that can be solved efficiently using min-cost flow. Through simulation experiments, we show that our algorithm is faster by several orders of magnitude than a MILP-based approach."

was a minor warming event. We investigated variations in gravity wave (GW) activity before and after this Antarctic SSW event using two satellite measurements (AIRS and CIPS) and reanalysis data (GEOS-5 FP). GW activity over the Andes decreased after August 30, although the westerly wind was 40–60 m/s and cannot filter out GWs with small zonal phase speed. This decline over the Andes was probably caused by wave saturation. Zonal mean GW activity over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean likewise decreased, with a weakening of zonal wind. The zonal mean GW activity further decreased around September 8 which coincided with a reversal of the zonal mean zonal wind at 40 km. The decline in the zonal mean GW activity after August 30 was probably caused by wind filtering and polar night jet breaking."

The dispersed SO2 and sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere were still detectable by multiple satellite sensors for many months after the eruption. For this study of SO2 and aerosol clouds we use data obtained from two of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite sensors on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite: total column SO2 from the Nadir Mapper and aerosol extinction profiles from the Limb Profiler as well as other satellite data sets. We evaluated the limb viewing geometry effect (the “arch effect”) in the retrieval of the LP standard aerosol extinction product at 674 nm. It was shown that the amount of SO2 decreases with a characteristic period of 8–18 d and the peak of stratospheric aerosol optical depth recorded at a wavelength of 674 nm lags the initial peak of SO2 mass by 1.5 months. Using satellite observations and a trajectory model, we examined the dynamics of an unusual atmospheric feature that was observed, a stratospheric coherent circular cloud of SO2 and aerosol from 18 July to 22 September 2019."

This makes the thermal design of Europa Clipper magnetometer more challenging. The design is required to be highly insulated and at the same time magnetically clean. This paper describes the thermal design evolution of Europa Clipper Magnetometer. A thermal vacuum test is conducted in Europa Clipper orbit’s relevant environment to characterize the requirements and estimate the power consumption. A flight-like engineering model magnetometer from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) is used for this test. Magnetically clean Cernox temperature measurement sensors with the accuracy of ±0.1ºC are used to measure the temperature value inside the sensor head and across the main frame interfaces. This level of accuracy in temperature measurement is required to capture the temperature gradient across the sensor head in a relevant environment which impacts the magnetometer measurement accuracy. Test data is used to correlate the thermal model and characterize the heat leak across the interfaces. Validated thermal model is used as a verification tool for power consumption and thermal requirements.

While size-resolved (bin) cloud microphysics models predict particle size distributions without imposing shapes, results are subject to artificial size distribution broadening owing to numerical diffusion associated with various processes. Whereas Part 1 addressed collision-coalescence, here we investigate numerical diffusion that occurs in solving condensation and evaporation. In a parcel model framework, all of the numerical schemes examined converge to one solution of condensation and evaporation as the mass grid is refined, and the advection-based schemes are recommended over the reassigning schemes. Including Eulerian vertical advection in a column limits the convergence to some extent, but that limitation occurs at a sufficiently fine mass grid, and the number of iterations in solving vertical advection should be minimized to reduce numerical diffusion. Insubstantial numerical diffusion in solving condensation can be amplified if collision-coalescence is also active, which in turn can be substantially diminished if turbulence effects on collision are incorporated. Large-eddy simulations of a drizzling stratocumulus field reveal that changes in moments of Doppler spectra obtained using different mass grids are consistent with those obtained from the simplified framework, and that spectral moments obtained using a mass grid designed to effectively reduce numerical diffusion are generally closer to observations. Notable differences between the simulations and observations still exist, and our results suggest a need to consider whether factors other than numerical diffusion in the fundamental process schemes employed can cause such differences."

This research focused specifically on modeling plume impingement, induced by Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters that flew on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) space shuttle Discovery. For each simulation, the continuum portion of the RCS thruster was simulated using MOC for solving hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and computed with the NASA code, Reacting and Multi-phase Program (RAMP). The solution was then implemented as a starting condition into the NASA DSMC code, Direct Simulation and Monte Carlo Analysis Code (DAC). Typically, DSMC models rely on code-to-code validation for fidelity. 

The significance of this research is in its ability to validate its models against empirical data. Prior to computing solutions for these simulations, the mesh size and structure were optimized and many variants of DSMC input parameters were iterated on in order to acquire a reliable, mesh-independent, fully optimized numerical solution. This research will discuss the mathematical formulation of MOC for nozzle flow and DSMC for rarefied gases. Additionally, it will provide an explanation of how to implement these mathematical concepts into the two solvers: RAMP and DAC. Ultimately, this research will demonstrate that the overall process illustrated produces results in good agreement with empirical data. As a consequence, the methodology presented is granted an increased level of confidence and will greatly contribute to the aerospace industry and its effort in understanding and predicting rarefied flow fields."

These streams cover separate segments of the reanalysis time period with short overlaps to allow reconstruction of the official record. A fundamental assumption justifying this approach is that the streams will be assimilating the same observations during the periods where they overlap, and so will eventually converge to a similar atmospheric state, making discontinuities at stream junctions negligible. This assumption is revisited in this work by examining the impact of analysis error on the differences between MERRA-2 overlapping streams in three historical periods. Comparison results are shown in terms of standard deviations of stream differences as well as the spectral decomposition of the variance of their differences. Residual differences were found at the end of each year of overlap, with larger values observed in the earlier segments of the presatellite era. By drawing parallels with analysis error statistics estimated from the GMAO OSSE system, these differences are shown to reflect the varying constraint of data with the varying observing network, and to further carry the imprint of errors that the data assimilation process is not able to mitigate. As such, they are unlikely to be reduced by longer spinup periods. The ability of data assimilation to ensure continuity in the parallel streams is put into question when the observing system coverage is inadequate or simply when the data assimilation system as a whole is suboptimal."

Here, using in situ measurements from 2474 sites in China, we evaluate the performance of soil moisture estimates from the L4 data assimilation (DA) system and from a baseline “open-loop” (OL) simulation of CLSM without Tb assimilation. Using random forest regression, the efficiency of the L4 DA system (i.e., the performance improvement in DA relative to OL) is attributed to eight control factors related to the CLSM as well as τ–ω radiative transfer model (RTM) components of the L4 system. Results show that the Spearman rank correlation (R) for L4 SSM with in situ measurements increases for 77 % of the in situ measurement locations (relative to that of OL), with an average R increase of approximately 14 % (ΔR=0.056). RZSM skill is improved for about 74 % of the in situ measurement locations, but the average R increase for RZSM is only 7 % (ΔR=0.034). Results further show that the SSM DA skill improvement is most strongly related to the difference between the RTM-simulated Tb and the SMAP Tb observation, followed by the error in precipitation forcing data and estimated microwave soil roughness parameter h. For the RZSM DA skill improvement, these three dominant control factors remain the same, although the importance of soil roughness exceeds that of the Tb simulation error, as the soil roughness strongly affects the ingestion of DA increments and further propagation to the subsurface. For the skill of the L4 and OL estimates themselves, the top two control factors are the precipitation error and the SSM–RZSM coupling strength error, both of which are related to the CLSM component of the L4 system. Finally, we find that the L4 system can effectively filter out errors in precipitation. Therefore, future development of the L4 system should focus on improving the characterization of the SSM–RZSM coupling strength."

Quantifying the hydration of asteroids is necessary to constrain models of the formation and evolution of the Solar System and the origin of Life on Earth. The OSIRIS-REx (Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security–Regolith Explorer) mission showed that near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu contains widespread, abundant hydrated phyllosilicates, indicated by a ubiquitous absorption at ~ 2.7 μm. The objective of this work is to quantify the hydration—that is, the hydrogen content—of phyllosilicates on Bennu's surface and investigate how this hydration varies spatially. We analyse spectral parameters (normalized optical path length, NOPL; effective single-scattering albedo, ESPAT; and Gaussian modeling) computed from the hydrated phyllosilicate absorption band of spatially resolved visible–near-infrared spectra acquired by OVIRS (the OSIRIS-REx Visible and InfraRed Spectrometer). We also computed the same spectral parameters using laboratory-measured spectra of meteorites including CMs, CIs, and the ungrouped C2 Tagish Lake. We estimate the mean hydrogen content of water and hydroxyl groups in hydrated phyllosilicates on Bennu's surface to be 0.71 ± 0.16 wt%. This value is consistent with the hydration range of some aqueously altered meteorites (CMs, C2 Tagish Lake), but not the most aqueously altered group (CIs). The sample collection site of the OSIRIS-REx mission has slightly higher hydrogen content than average. Spatial variations in hydrogen content on Bennu's surface are linked to geomorphology, and may have been partially inherited from its parent body."

In this technical memorandum, measures taken to improve the mechanical handling of brittle Fe-based ribbons are described for a custom SA system.  This system was then used to process a series of Fe-based alloys (Fe-2Nb-2Mo-1Cu-15.5Si-7B at.%,  Fe-5Co-3Ta-1Cu-16Si-6.5B at.%,  and  Fe-5Co-3Ta-1Cu-16.5Si-6B at.%) and the resulting magnetic properties were determined.

The algorithm can accurately match the calculations of the reference (rPPH) independent column approximation (ICA) results, but use only the same computational time required for a single plane parallel computation. The effective optical depth of this synthetic sPPH cloud is derived by exactly matching the direct transmission to that of the inhomogeneous ICA cloud. The ffective9 scattering asymmetry factor is found from a pre-calculated albedo inverse look-up-table that is allowed to vary over the range from -1.0 to 1.0. In the special cases of conservative scattering and total absorption, the synthetic method is exactly equivalent to the ICA, with only a small bias (about 0.2% in flux) relative to ICA due to imperfect interpolation in using the look-up tables. In principle, the ICA albedo can be approximated accurately regardless of cloud inhomogeneity. For a more complete comparison, the broadband shortwave albedo and transmission calculated from the synthetic sPPH cloud and averaged over all incident directions, have the RMS biases of 0.26% and 0.76%, respectively, for inhomogeneous clouds over a wide variation of particle size. The advantages of the synthetic PPH method are that (1) it is not required that all the cloud subcolumns have uniform microphysical characteristic, (2) it is applicable to any 1D radiative transfer scheme, and (3) it can handle arbitrary cloud optical depth distributions and an arbitrary number of cloud subcolumns with uniform computational efficiency."

As a result, it is desirable to design light weight conductor materials, thus reducing the payload of components like motor windings, low voltage signal cables, and transmission cables for data and power. One approach involves replacing pure Cu wiring with metalized CNT composites. This paper evaluates a framework for modeling overall conductivity and current sharing within such composites. Processing methods and parameters were refined. Select electroplated samples outperformed pure Cu in conductivity and had comparable ultimate tensile strengths. Tensile strengths are expected to improve with an additional densification step during processing. Acoustic emission data was used to predict the failure mechanism of the composite. Theories explaining improved intrinsic conductivity are discussed, with a focus on chemical and mechanical interactions at the Cu-CNT interface. These include Cu infiltration of CNT crevices, CNT oxidation, activity at defects in CNT walls, and the release of carbide-forming metals from CNT walls. Validating any or all these theories will require further work replicating data, collecting electron micrographs and conducting chemical analyses."

SMOS or SMAP observations (~40-km resolution) are only available for less than 20% of the globally reported landslide events, because they are intermittent and uncertain in regions with complex terrain. GRACE terrestrial water storage estimates include 75% of the reported landslides but have coarse spatial and temporal resolutions (monthly, ~300-km). CLSM soil water simulations have the added advantage of complete spatial and temporal coverage, and are found to be able to distinguish between “stable slope” (no landslide) conditions and landslide-inducing conditions in a probabilistic way. Assimilating SMOS and/or GRACE data increases the landslide probability estimates based on soil water percentiles for the reported landslides, relative to model-only estimates at 36-km resolution for the period 2011-2016, unless the CLSM model-only soil water content is already high (≥ 50th percentile). The SMAP Level 4 data assimilation product (at 9-km resolution, period 2015-2019) more generally updates the soil water conditions towards higher landslide probabilities for the reported landslides, but is similar to model-only estimates for the majority of landslides where SMAP data cannot easily be converted to soil moisture owing to complex terrain."

Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (VIS) system design and performance for the European Enhanced Exploration
Exercise Device (E4D). In preparation for the International Space Station (ISS) in-flight demonstration, a list of
critical Human Health Countermeasures (HHC) exercises was compiled [1]. The goal of this study was to assess the
ground reaction forces and moments imposed by an exercising subject in each of the six VIS Degrees of Freedom
(DOFs) during a comprehensive set of these critical exercises performed on the E4D.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The ISS in-flight demonstration list of critical exercises included seated aerobic
rowing, bent-over rowing, cycling, front squats, back squats, conventional deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, heel raises,
overhead presses, reverse chops, and power clean presses. At the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) Prototype
Immersive Technology (PIT) laboratory, motion capture data were collected on critical E4D exercises for six
subjects. At the NASA JSC Active Response Gravity Offload System (ARGOS) facility, additional motion capture
and load cell data were collected on offloaded trials for four subjects. Select data were extrapolated to represent a 5th
percentile female subject and a 95th percentile male subject.
A previous investigation comparing the forces obtained from the load cell and from motion capture based data found
a satisfactory level of agreement between the two measurements [2]. The motion capture based data were analyzed
for this study since it is driven by the subject’s trajectory alone, automatically excluding any forces exerted on the
subject by the ARGOS offloading harness.
The OpenSim [3, 4] biomechanical simulation inverse kinematics tool was used to calculate the joint angles based
on the locations of motion capture markers placed at key positions on the subject’s body. An OpenSim plugin was
then used to obtain the forces and moments generated by the subject during each trial, with the moments computed
relative to the equilibrium location of the subject’s feet [5]. The force of gravity was also removed to simulate the
loads generated by the exercise when performed in microgravity. The load plots for each trial were generated and
visually analyzed to obtain the magnitudes of the peak loads for each exercise in each DOF. The typical period of
exercise for each trial was also estimated and used to calculate the frequency for each trial. The exercise loads data
was then organized in multiple ways to capture different aspects of the data. As a result of this study, we present a
summary of the load magnitudes observed during these critical exercises utilizing the E4D."

In thispreliminary test, we employ the open-source biomechanical tool OpenSim [3,4] to analyze the impact of lunargravity(Lg)on  twoobject-pickup motions performed  by  a  singleshirt-sleevedsubject.Specifically,  we  attempt  to answer the following questionsbased on an estimation of theCenter of Mass Projection (CoMP) and groundreaction forceCenter of Pressure (COP) as it relates to the astronaut Base of Support (BOS) for 1g and Lgconditions:1.Is the taskmotion, asperformed in 1g,dynamically feasible in 1g andLg?2.Can we make the motion dynamicallyfeasiblein Lg by slowing it down?3.Is the LgCOP equal to the 1gCOP at a theoretically predicted reduction in motion speed?

METHODS AND RESULTS:To answer the first question,the gravitational acceleration in the OpenSim modelismodified from a nominal 9.81 m/s2to 1.64m/s2, andthe 1gjoint trajectory isinput to an OpenSim based method[5] for estimating ground reaction forces and moments.  From this method, the position oftheCoMP andCOP can be estimated and checked to see if they remain withina simulated BOSformed from  the footprintof  the  OpenSim  model  to  determine  whether the  motion is  dynamically  feasible.As expected, both of the motions were estimated to be feasible in a 1g environment, however,both motions had periods of infeasibility in Lg.It is well known that crew members make adjustments to motion trajectories in altered gravity fields to maintain balance.  As a first step, we considered the simple adjustment of slowingthe motionin Lgby a constant  factor.  This  was accomplished  by  scaling  the  time  stamps  in  the  motion  trajectory  file  by  that factor.  For the two motions considered, it was found that scale factors of 1.3 and 1.4 kept the COP just within  the  subject  BOS.The  CoMP  is  unchanged  by  the  gravity  field.Simple  analysis  of  an  inverted pendulum in the Lg environment, which generalizes to a general multibody system,leads to a theoreticalprediction  that  areduction  in  speed  factor  of√1g/Lg,  or  2.445,will  make  the  COP trajectory in  Lg equivalent to that in 1g.  When the above procedure was performed with a factor of 2.445, the estimated COP in Lg, was observed to be very close to that in 1g.In summary, we  have  developed a  method for estimating the CoMP and COP in Lg, for subject motion collected in 1g.  We believe this method can prove to be a valuable check and balance for simulated Lg  training  and  testing  by  exposingpotentialsimulator-inducedartifacts  that  make  the  simulated  task motion seem possible, when in fact, it would violate the above criteria.  We also note that a reduction in task speed should tend the  task motion towards  stability, with a  theoreticalslowdownfactor of √1g/Lgmaking the motion stability equal to that in 1g according to the CoMP andCOP criteria."

The radar provides a unique capability to detect  orbital debris population sizes   down   to   an   approximate   size   of   3   mm   for altitudes less than 1000 km, and even smaller sizes at lower altitudes. Due to the limited number of hours that are available from this radar each year, it is often used to validate measurements obtained by other radar data sources in the range of orbital debris sizes where the radar   systems   have   an   overlap.   Additionally,   the Goldstone   radar   provides   significantly   improved sensitivity than is available from other ground-based radar data sources, which enables it to observe orbital debris populations that, although smaller, still represent a significant risk to both robotic and human missions in LEO. Over the decade of observations from 2007 to2017, a number  of significant  on-orbit events  have occurred   including   the   anti-satellite   test   againstFengyun-1C,   and   the   accidental   collision   between Cosmos 2251 and Iridium 33. The orbital debris flux as measured by the Goldstone radar over this important time period is reviewed in this paper, as well as the evolution of the environment over the ensuing years since   these   events.   In   addition,   the   measurements provided   by   this   radar   in   the   years   prior   to   the deployment   of   large   constellations   into   the environment,   as   well   as   the   significant   increase   in missions and mission participants in recent years, is of interest since it provides a baseline for monitoring the effects of these and other changes in the coming years. In 2018, the Goldstone bistatic orbital  debris  radar pointing   geometry   changed   due   to   the decommissioning of the nearby receiver antenna, Deep Space Station (DSS) 15, located approximately 500 m from   the   transmitter   antenna.   The   historical combination of the DSS-14 transmitter and DSS-15receiver enabled all of LEO to be observed using a single pointing due to the close proximity of the two antenna stations and the resulting beam overlap of the bistatic radar geometry. The updated bistatic Goldstone geometry, following the decommissioning of DSS-15,utilizes one of the pair of DSS-25 or DSS-26 antennas that   are   located   approximately   10   km   from   the transmitter station. The resulting beam overlap with this pointing is such that in LEO, only a small fraction of LEO altitude coverage is observable at one time. Given the operational  change  of the radar,  it is of interest to review the data collected by the original Goldstone   bistatic   radar   over   the   final   decade preceding this change."

Since   these   materials   pyrolyze   rather   than   melt   and their   different   components   demise   at   different   rates, modeling their destruction to determine ground impact risk   is   complex.   Modern   spacecraft   are   using   these materials   in   ever-greater   quantities   owing   to   their superior strength-to-weight characteristics, and this has required that the orbital debris community improve its understanding   of   how   these   materials   demise   on reentry. The   NASA   Orbital   Debris   Program   Office   undertook an extensive test campaign to better understand the rate at   which   several   types   of   GFRP   and   CFRP   materials pyrolyze under reentry heating conditions and how that pyrolysis affects the ultimate strength of the material. GFRP   with   a   polyester   resin   (G10/FR-4)   and   CFRP with   epoxy,   cyanate   ester,   vinyl   ester,   and   phenolic resins were tested. The test campaign was carried out at the Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Torch Facility at the   University   of   Texas   at   Austin.   Because   the   ICP facility   operates   in   a   shirt-sleeve   environment,   test samples   can   be   changed   within   seconds   or   minutes, allowing many samples to be tested in a short period. Two  heat  flux  rates,  20  W/m2  and  30W/m2,  and  two oxygen   concentration   conditions,   0%   and   2%   of atmospheric, were applied to all five types of material. To   measure   both   the   char   rate   and   the   effect   of pyrolysis on the ultimate  material strength, two types of test were  carried  out for each  material: a char  rate test on a ~10 mm thick sample of material and an in-situ   bending   stress   test   of   a   ~2   mm   thick   sample   of material. Measurements   of   the   char   rate   showed   very   similar average  pyrolysis front velocity in epoxy resin CFRP as   in   G10   at   3.6   mm/min   and   3.4   mm/min, respectively.   However,   the   total  mass  loss  rate   in  theG10 was nearly double that of the CFRP at 3.8 g/min and   2.2   g/min,   respectively.   This   result   represented   a slow ablation rate of carbon fibers in the CFRP at the temperatures   encountered   in   low   Earth   orbit   reentry and a comparatively rapid removal of the glass fibers in  G10   due   to   melting   and   spallation.  Pyrolysis   front velocity was more significantly affected by the type of plastic   than   the   type   of   fiber,   with   the   cyanate   ester CFRP   samples   displaying   an   average   pyrolysis   front velocity of only 1.9 mm/min. Similarly,   the   effect   of   thermal   exposure   on   the ultimate strength of the material depended heavily on the type of plastic and very little on the type of fiber in the material. Epoxy, vinyl ester, and polyester resins all behaved very similarly, with complete structural failure at   between   400   J/g   and   600   J/g   of   specific   absorbed heat.   Phenolic   and   cyanate   ester   resins,   on   the   other hand,   displayed   a   change   in   structural   properties   that was only barely measurable with the current apparatus even after the maximum exposure time tested. These   data   are   being   incorporated   into   a   numerical model   of   the   ablation   and   demise   of   composite materials that will be used to more accurately calculate the ground casualty risk of future spacecraft."

for the NASA Ames Research Center’s 20 MW Panel Test Facility (PTF). Surface pressure, heat flux to a water-cooled plate, and surface temperature on a tile plate coated with reaction-cured glass were measured across several conditions in the facility and compared with laminar and fully-turbulent CFD simulations. The potential for bypass transition in the PTF nozzle was assessed via application of the Langtry-Menter four-equation transitional shear-stress transport (SST) model. Results from the transition model were inconsistent with measurements. Flow interaction with a boundary conditioning plate feature inside the nozzle was also investigated as a potential source of laminar-to-turbulent transition using two turbulence models with specified transition locations. The Baldwin-Lomax turbulence model was configured to simulate a transition at the upstream edge of the boundary conditioning plate and produced results consistent with the surface pressure measurements but not the cold-wall heat flux. Finally, the SST turbulence model was calibrated to transition at the upstream edge of the boundary conditioning plate and produced results consistent with both the surface pressure and cold-wall heat flux measurements. The SST-based model demonstrated reasonable agreement with surface temperature measurements on the reaction-cured glass tile, albeit with some discrepancies."

Two-year averaged daytime TOA CRF is estimated at between -1.08 and 0.78 W·m-2 (-0.49 to 1.10 W·m-2 in 2017, and -1.67 to 0.47 W·m-2 in 2018).  This subarctic study completes a now trilogy of MPLNET ground-based cloud forcing investigations, following midlatitude and tropical studies by Campbell et al. (2016; C16) at Greenbelt, Maryland and Lolli et al. (2017) at Singapore.  C16 hypothesize a global meridional daytime TOA CRF gradient that begins positive at the equator (2.20 – 2.59 W·m-2 over land and -0.46 – 0.42 W·m-2 over ocean at Singapore), becomes neutral in the midlatitudes (0.03 – 0.27 W·m-2 over land in Maryland) and turns negative moving poleward.  This study does not completely confirm C16, as values are not found as exclusively negative.  Evidence in historical reanalysis data suggests that daytime cirrus forcing in and around the subarctic likely once was exclusively negative. Increasing tropopause heights, inducing higher and colder cirrus, have likely increased regional forcing over the last forty years.  We hypothesize that subarctic inter-annual cloud variability is likely a considerable influence on global cirrus cloud forcing sensitivity, given the irregularity of polar versus midlatitude synoptic weather intrusions.  This study and hypothesis lays basis for an extrapolation of these MPLNET experiments to satellite-based lidar cirrus cloud datasets."

Simultaneous high-data-rate acoustic measurements (93 channels in total) were obtained using a circumferential sensor array at the core-nozzle exit in conjunction with sideline and farfield microphone arrays for several relevant engine operational points. Measurements were repeated for different circumferential and sideline array configurations, as well as for redundancy. The unsteady pressure field at the core-nozzle exit is documented in detail. Previous work suggested that the±1azimuthal duct mode could be cut-on at this location, which would have implications for combustor-noise modeling and prediction. The modal decomposition of the combustor noise at the core-nozzle exit verifies this observation. Select farfield sound-pressure-level spectra are also presented."

The neural network is trained with CALIPSO ocean surface and atmospheric backscatter measurements together with collocated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS(AMSR-E) ocean surface wind speed. Ocean surface wind speeds are derived by applying the neural network algorithm to CALIPSO measurements between 2008 and 2020. CALIPSO wind speed measurement of 2015 also compare with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) measurements on the Global Change Observation Mission –Water ""Shizuku""(GCOM-W) satellite. Aerosol optical depths are then derived from CALIPSO’s ocean surface backscatter signal and theoretical ocean surface reflectance calculated from CALIPSO wind speed and Cox-Munk wind –surface slope variance relation. This CALIPSO wind speed retrieval technique is an improvement from Hu et al.  (2008), as it can be applied to most clear skies with optical depths up to 1.5 without making assumptions about aerosol lidar ratio."

As such, there are now long histories  of  such  simulations and  predictions spanning  multiple  decades  and  multiple ensemble  members, both  of  which  are crucial  for separating climate  signal  from  climate noise.  A key focus of such runs has been the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), spurred by recent improvements in our ability to predict such events, though questions remain as to how well climate models do beyond simply always predicting the “canonical” atmospheric response  to  an ENSO  event—something simple statistical  models  already  do  reasonably well.  This is a critical issue that needs addressing, given the importance of event-to-event differences for predicting regional impacts of ENSO teleconnections, and the need to justify the  expense  of  running  sophisticated  climate  models.   Unfortunately,  current  diagnostic tools are not well suited for quantifying the different sources of variability associated with specific  phenomena  such  as  ENSO. More  generally,  while  much  effort  has  focused  on addressing model bias, less has been done to address errors in second moment statistics—an issue whose importance is gaining increased attention particularly as we build climate prediction  systems  capable  of taking  advantage  of forecasts  of  opportunity—a  capability that requires reliable estimates of forecast uncertainty. In this report, we outline a phenomenon-based statistical decomposition of climate variance(in  essence  a detailed variance  budget)that  is  specifically  tailored to  address  the  above questions by separating the variability (both the signal and noise) into that tied to the long-term  average  impact  of a  particular  phenomenon(the  composite  mean) and the event-to-event(E2E) variability about  the  composite  mean. In  addition,  we  provide  related decompositions  of  the  correlations  that  allow us  to quantify  how  much  of  the  agreement with observations (the skill) comes from the composite mean as opposed to from the E2Evariability.  As an example, we present the results of such a decomposition for ENSO based on  simulations  with  the  GEOS atmospheric  general  circulation  model  (AGCM),  with  a focus on the monthly mean impacts over North America during boreal winter(December –March).  Here we take advantage of existing GEOS AGCM simulations that were produced as companion simulations to MERRA-2for the period 1980-2016.  Comparisons are made throughout with MERRA-2."

elimination in the Prototype Verification System (PVS). Previously,
PVS had three strategies for quantifier elimination—hutch, tarski, and
sturm. Of these, only hutch is able to decide queries in any input
format—sturm only works on queries regarding a single polynomial on an
interval and tarski resolves queries in the universal existential
fragment. This paper describes an extended version of tarski. The
extension is accomplished by formally verifying a disjunctive normal
form transformation in PVS and using tarski on each conjunctive
clause. Additionally, a preprocessing step is added to the decision
procedure underlying tarski. This preprocessing is designed to exploit
properties of polynomial structure to quickly resolve queries that
have certain formats. The preprocessing produces dramatic speedup when
it succeeds in resolving a query, and seems to introduce negligible
overhead when it does not resolve a query. Finally, testing reveals
some ways to improve the hutch and tarski strategies."

Simulations using NASA's one-dimensional (1D) Icing Risk Analysis tool were used to determine potential inlet conditions that could lead to ice-crystal accretion along the inlet of the core flowpath and into the high-pressure compressor. Baseline conditions were established, and parameters were varied to observe accretion characteristics. Data were acquired at altitudes varying from 5 kft to 45 kft, at nominal ice particle median volumetric diameters from 20 µm to 100 µm, and total water contents of 1 g/m3 to 12 g/m3. Metal temperatures were acquired for the inlet guide vane and vane stators 1–2. In situ measurements of the particle size distribution were acquired upstream and downstream of the engine fan face in order to study particle breakup behavior. Cameras were installed in the engine to capture ice accretions at the leading edge of the fan stator, splitter lip, and inlet guide vane. The goal of this study was to understand the key parameters of accretion, acquire particle breakup data aft of the fan, and generate a unique icing dataset for model development. Significant particle breakup downstream of the fan in the bypass was observed. The metal temperatures on the inlet guide vanes (IGVs) and stators show a temperature increase with increasing particle size. Accretion behavior at the fan stator and splitter lip across was very similar. However, accretion decreased with increasing particle size at the IGVs."

Flash Drought: Links to an Extreme Positive IOD,"Much of the southeast United States experienced record dry conditions during September of 2019, with the area in abnormally dry to exceptional drought conditions growing from 25% at the beginning of the month to 80% by the end of the month.   The drought ended just as abruptlydue to above normal rain that fell during the second half of October.  In this study we employed MERRA-2 and the GEOS-5 AGCM to diagnose the underlying causes of the drought’s onset, maintenance, and demise. The basic   approach involves performing a series of AGCM simulations in which the model is constrained to remain close to MERRA-2 over pre-specified areas that are external to the drought region.   The start of the drought appears to have been forced by anomalous heating in the central/western tropical Pacific that resulted in low level anti-cyclonic flow and a tendency for descending motion over much of the southeast.  An anomalous ridge associated with a Rossby wave train (emanating from the Indian Ocean region) is found to be the main source of the most intense temperature and precipitation anomalies that develop over the southeast during the last week of September.  A second Rossby wave train (emanating from the same region) is responsible for the substantial rain that fell during the second half of October to end the drought.  The links to the Indian Ocean Dipole (with record positive values) as well a sa waning El Nino allow some speculation as to the likelihood of similar events occurring in the future."

Bumper was developed in the late-1980s and has been continuously maintained and used since.  The user base has grown from a few government entities now include numerous commercial entities as well.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) Hypervelocity Impact Technology (HVIT) group is responsible for all aspects of the Bumper software. Bumper has been used to characterize MMOD risk on many spacecraft.  All of the International Space Station (ISS) modules, visiting vehicles and numerous external components and systems have been analyzed. Bumper was used to analyze the Space Shuttle, Orion, and many space probes, telescopes and satellites.  Bumper is also being used to analyze future spacecraft such as the Deep Space Gateway (DSG) and Mars Sample Return (MSR) missions.   The Bumper Configuration Control Board (CCB) ensures that all changes to the code are approved, reviewed, and documented. The current Bumper version – “Bumper 3” – is a Fortran executable that utilizes a 64-bit architecture.  Bumper has numerous features that make it a powerful tool for analyzing spacecraft MMOD risk.  Bumper uses the latest orbital debris and meteoroidenvironment models.  Bumper also has a large library of ballistic limit “damage” equations available that can be used for a wide variety of MMOD shielding configurations.  Bumper can also handle large spacecraft finite elementmodels (FEMs) and conducts checks of the model.

Bell has developed the Autonomous Pod Transport (APT) vehicle to serve this market, with entry into service in mid-2020s. Adverse weather conditions can introduce risks and inefficiencies in urban environments leading to flight delays and cancellations. In 2018, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Bell entered into a cooperative agreement, under the Systems Integration and Operationalization (SIO) program to tackle key challenges to enable future commercial unmanned aircraft operations. The Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, joined this team to demonstrate weather avoidance technologies for remotely piloted and autonomous vehicles. CASA has developed the ‘City Warn’ hazard alerting platform to gather weather information from various weather sensors and models, and based on user (or mission) preferences for alerting and on user (or unmanned aircraft) locations, the platform shares timely weather intelligence with users and the systems used by them for remote operations. This presentation discusses the weather avoidance solution developed during this project, leading up to the demonstration of the end-to-end system in Fall 2020. The presentation will cover the following topics: 1) goals related to weather avoidance 2) the design requirements process, including the results of pilot interviews, 3) weather observation and avoidance needs 4) selection of regional and national weather data sets 5) design of the weather graphical interface and 6) considerations for real-time weather alerting. The end-to-end system that was developed will be discussed, along with the results from the demonstration flight. The presentation will conclude with insights from the project team on lessons learned and best practices on weather avoidance technologies for the industry going ahead."

Gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, however, remain of special interest since they can be precursors to high-energy astrophysical phenomena like γ-ray bursts and kilonovae. While late-time electromagnetic emissions provide important information about the astrophysical processes within, the prompt emission along with gravitational waves uniquely reveals the extreme matter and gravity during—and in the seconds following—merger. Rapid communication of source location and properties from the gravitational-wave data is crucial to facilitate multimessenger follow-up of such sources. This is especially enabled if the partner facilities are forewarned via an early warning (pre-merger) alert. Here we describe the commissioning and performance of such a low-latency infrastructure within LIGO-Virgo. We present results from an end-to-end mock data challenge that detects binary neutron star mergers and alerts partner facilities before merger. We set expectations for these alerts in future observing runs."

New results are obtained throughcoordinated analysis of two types of data from Mars Global Surveyor: atmospheric profiles re-trieved from radio occultation (RO) measurements and wide-angle images from the Mars OrbiterCamera (MOC). Some RO profiles contain a layer of neutral static stability, which indicates thepresence of convective mixing at a local time (about 5 h) when it does not usually occur. Thesenocturnal mixed layers (NMLs) were observed frequently in early summer of Mars year 27 atlatitudes of 53–72◦N and longitudes of 210–330◦E. The base of a typical NML is 3 km abovethe surface, about the same height as the nighttime cloud layer detected by the Phoenix LIDARin early summer of Mars year 29 at 234◦E, 68◦N. The depth of the NMLs ranges from less than1 km to more than 5 km. Comparisons with nearly simultaneous MOC images demonstrate thatNMLs are closely associated with water-ice clouds. There is a dense cluster of NMLs within theannular cloud that appears every year in early summer between Alba Mons and the north polarresidual ice cap. The lighting conditions at this location and season allowed MOC to observe theannular cloud on most orbits, at 118-min intervals. Its appearance varies dramatically with localtime, becoming more symmetrical and better organized at night and dissipating to a crescentshape during the day. According to high-resolution numerical simulations (Spiga et al., 2017),including a large-eddy simulation at the Phoenix landing site, NMLs form when radiative cool-ing by water-ice aerosols causes convective instability; the mixed layer is forced from above bynegative buoyancy. Our results strongly support this conclusion. In addition, MOC images frommidsummer contain eastward-moving frontal clouds. Temperature profiles within these cloudsshow signs of near-surface advection of warm air, which reduces the static stability of the loweratmosphere and contributes, along with cloud radiation, to the formation of an NML."

We find that the MOA-2007-BLG-400L planetary system consists of a 1.71 ± 0.27M(sub Jup) planet orbiting a 0.69 ± 0.04M⨀ K-dwarf host star at a distance of 6.89 ± 0.77 kpc from the Sun. So, this planetary system probably resides in the Galactic bulge. The planet–host star projected separation is only weakly constrained due to the close-wide light-curve degeneracy; the 2σ projected separation ranges are 0.6–1.0 au and 4.7–7.7 au for close and wide solutions, respectively. This host mass is at the top end of the range of masses predicted by a standard Bayesian analysis. Our Keck follow-up program has now measured lens-source separations for six planetary microlensing events, and five of these six events have host star masses above the median prediction under the assumption that assumes that all stars have an equal chance of hosting planets detectable by microlensing. This suggests that more massive stars may be more likely to host planets of a fixed mass ratio that orbit near or beyond the snow line. These results also indicate the importance of host star mass measurements for exoplanets found by microlensing. The microlensing survey imaging data from NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST) mission will be doing mass measurements like this for a huge number of planetary events."

Remote sensing assessments of vegetation function have traditionally used actively excited foliar chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, canopy optical reflectance data and vegetation indices (VIs), and only recently passive solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measurements. In general, reflectance data are more sensitive to the seasonal variations in canopy chlorophyll content and foliar biomass, while fluorescence observations more closely relate to the dynamic changes in plant photosynthetic function. With this dataset we link leaf level actively excited chlorophyll fluorescence, canopy proximal reflectance and SIF, with eddy covariance measurements of gross ecosystem productivity (GEP). The dataset was collected during the 2017 growing season on maize, using three automated systems (i.e., Monitoring Pulse-Amplitude-Modulation fluorimeter, Moni-PAM; Fluorescence Box, FloX; and from eddy covariance tower). The data were quality checked, filtered and collated to a common 30 minutes timestep. We derived vegetation indices related to canopy functioning (e.g., Photochemical Reflectance Index, PRI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI; Chlorophyll Red-edge, Clre) to investigate how SIF and VIs can be coupled for monitoring vegetation photosynthesis. The raw datasets and the filtered and collated data are provided to enable new processing and analyses."

We have developed a new formalism for determining chance alignment probabilities based on the BANYAN Σ tool, and find a 100% probability that this is a physically associated pair. Through a detailed examination of Ross 19A, we find that the system is metal-poor ([Fe/H] = −0.40 ± 0.12) with an age of 7.2 (+3.8, -3.6) Gyr. Combining new and existing photometry and astrometry, we find that Ross 19B is one of the coldest known wide-separation companions, with a spectral type on the T/Y boundary, an effective temperature of 500 (+115, -100) K, and a mass in the range 15–40 M(Jup).

Two new ε parametrizations have recently been developed based on one hand on the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite multi-angular brightness temperature measurements and on the other hand on new laboratory measurements. These two approaches are fully independent. These new ε parametrizations are compared with each other and with the ε models previously in use in the SMOS, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Aquarius SSS retrievals. The two new ε parametrizations are found to be in closer agreement than with earlier parametrizations for most common ocean conditions.

Starting in 2017, the project aims at setting up a computational web-based platform focusing on satellite sea surface salinity data, supporting studies on enhanced validation and scientific process over the ocean. It has been designed in close collaboration with a dedicated science advisory group in order to achieve three main objectives: gathering all the data required to exploit satellite sea surface salinity data, systematically producing a wide range of metrics for comparing and monitoring sea surface salinity products’ quality, and providing user-friendly tools to explore, visualize and exploit both the collected products and the results of the automated analyses. The Salinity Pi-MEP is becoming a reference hub for the validation of satellite sea surface salinity missions by providing valuable information on satellite products (SMOS, Aquarius, SMAP), an extensive in situ database (e.g., Argo, thermosalinographs, moorings, drifters) and additional thematic datasets (precipitation, evaporation, currents, sea level anomalies, sea surface temperature, etc.). Co-localized databases between satellite products and in situ datasets are systematically generated together with validation analysis reports for 30 predefined regions. The data and reports are made fully accessible through the web interface of the platform. The datasets, validation metrics and tools (automatic, user-driven) of the platform are described in detail in this paper. Several dedicated scientific case studies involving satellite SSS data are also systematically monitored by the platform, including major river plumes, mesoscale signatures in boundary currents, high latitudes, semi-enclosed seas, and the high-precipitation region of the eastern tropical Pacific. Since 2019, a partnership in the Salinity Pi-MEP project has been agreed between ESA and NASA to enlarge focus to encompass the entire set of satellite salinity sensors. The two agencies are now working together to widen the platform features on several technical aspects, such as triple-collocation software implementation, additional match-up collocation criteria and sustained exploitation of data from the SPURS campaigns"

Formation by CO2-ice block or snow cornice falls has been proposed based on optical imagery of bright, high-albedo features inside gully channels. Because these features often resemble patchy frost residue rather than three-dimensional blocks, more evidence is needed to support the ice-block formation mechanism. Satellite imagery captured two simultaneous airborne plumes with in-channel sources at the Russell crater megadune, thrust up, and dispersed outward along the path of linear dune gullies. We use spectral data analyses, climatic analyses of bolometric temperatures, and thermal modeling to further develop the mechanistic framework for linear dune gully development. Basal sublimation and CO2 gas venting likely cause CO2-ice-block detachment and falls from gully alcoves in southern early spring, accompanied by ice-block off-gassing and saltation of sands and coarse silts that are redeposited around gully channels, and lofting of sublimation lag (coarse dust/silt) into airborne plumes."

The 1.6-yr HLS Reference survey is currently envisioned to image 2000 deg2 in multiple bands to a depthof∼26.5 in Y, J, H and to cover the same area with slit-less spectroscopy beyond z=3. The combination of deep, multiband photometry and deep spectroscopy will allow scientists to measure the growth and geometry of the Universe through a variety of cosmological probes (e.g. weak lensing, galaxy clusters, galaxy clustering, BAO, Type Ia supernova) and, equally, it will allow an exquisite control of observational and astrophysical systematic effects. In this paper, we explore multiprobe strategies that can be implemented, given the telescope’s instrument capabilities. We model cosmological probes individually and jointly and account for correlated systematics and statistical uncertainties due to the higher order moments of the density field. We explore different levels of observational systematics for the HLS survey (photo-z and shear calibration) and ultimately run a joint likelihood analysis in N-dim parameter space. We find that the HLS reference survey alone can achieve a standard dark energy FoM of>300 when including all probes. This assumes no information from external data sets, we assume a flat universe however, and includes realistic assumptions for systematics. Our study of the HLS reference survey should be seen as part of a future community-driven effort to simulate and optimize the science return of the Roman Space Telescope."

We applied the high-resolution spectral differential imaging technique to the OSIRIS J-band data but did not detect the Paβ line at the level predicted using the parameters of Hashimoto et al.

We compared our Paβ detection limits with the previous Hα flux and Hβ limits and estimated AV to be ∼0.9 and 2.0 for PDS 70 b and c, respectively. In particular, PDS 70 b’s AV is much smaller than implied by high-contrast near-infrared studies, which suggests the infrared-continuum photosphere and the hydrogen-emitting regions exist at different heights above the forming planet."

During the ∼25 days of TESS observations, we acquired three simultaneous UV/X-ray observations using Swift that total ∼18 ks, 21 simultaneous epochs totaling ∼98 ks of X-ray data using NICER, one observation (∼3 hr) with UH88, and one observation (∼3 hr) with LCOGT. We identified 56 flares in the TESS light curve with estimated energies in the range log E(T) (erg) = (30.5–33.2), nine flares in the Swift UVM2 light curve with estimated energies in the range log E(UV) (erg) = (29.3–31.1), 14 flares in the NICER light curve with estimated minimum energies in the range log E(N) (erg) = (30.5–32.3), and 1 flare in the LCOGT light curve with log E(L) (erg) = 31.6. We find that the flare frequency distributions (FFDs) of TESS and NICER flares have comparable slopes, β(T) = −0.67 ± 0.09 and β(N) = − 0.65 ± 0.19, and the FFD of UVOT flares has a shallower slope (β(U) = −0.38 ± 0.13).

Photometry from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS) yields radii of R(b) = 2.33 ± 0.10 and R(c) = 2.82 ± 0.15 Rꚛ, and periods of 3.13 and 7.49 d for TOI-1260 b and TOI-1260 c, respectively.

From HARPS-N high-precision radial velocities we obtain M(b) = 8.6(+1.4,−1.5) and M(c) = 11.8(+3.4,−3.2) Mꚛ. The star is moderately active with a complex activity pattern, which necessitated the use of Gaussian process regression for both the light-curve detrending and the radial velocity modelling, in the latter case guided by suitable activity indicators. We successfully disentangle the stellar-induced signal from the planetary signals, underlining the importance and usefulness of the Gaussian process approach. We test the system’s stability against atmospheric photoevaporation and find that the TOI-1260 planets are classic examples of the structure and composition ambiguity typical for the 2–3 Rꚛ range."

However, statistical analyses of planet demography must include those planets to accurately determine occurrence rates. As part of a systematic modelling effort in the context of a >10-yr retrospective analysis of MOA’s survey observations to build an extended MOA statistical sample, we analyse the light curve of the planetary microlensing event MOA-2014-BLG-472. This event provides weak constraints on the physical parameters of the lens, as a result of a planetary anomaly occurring at low magnification in the light curve. We use a Bayesian analysis to estimate the properties of the planet, based on a refined Galactic model and the assumption that all Milky Way’s stars have an equal planet-hosting probability. We find that a lens consisting of a 1.9(+2.2,−1.2)M(J) giant planet orbiting a 0.31(+0.36,−0.19)Mꙩ host at a projected separation of 0.75±0.24au is consistent with the observations and is most likely, based on the Galactic priors. The lens most probably lies in the Galactic bulge, at 7.2(+0.6,−1.7)kpc from Earth. The accurate measurement of the measured planet-to-host star mass ratio will be included in the next statistical analysis of cold planet demography detected by microlensing."

Despite numerous classic and recent literature, it is still hard to develop anRT code from scratch within a few weeks. It is equally hard to understand, not to mention modify, an existing “monster” RT code, for which the developer is either located remotely or has retired. Following the format of “Numerical Recipes” by Press et al., we collocate in this paper small pieces of necessary theory with corresponding small pieces of RT code. These are arranged in an order that is natural for code development, which is often opposite of the natural order for laying out the theoretical basis. We focus on the transfer of unpolarized monochromatic solar radiation in a plane-parallel atmosphere over a reflecting surface. Both the surface and the atmosphere are homogeneous (uniform) at all directions. The multiple scattering is numerically solved using the deterministic method of Gauss-Seidel iterations. Except for the presented Python-Numba open-source RT code gsit, the paper does not report any new scientific results, but rather serves as an academic demonstration. If development time is an issue or the reader is familiar with basic concepts of RT theory, we recommend proceeding directly to Sec.3 “RT code development."

Our results indicate that for high energy impacts, both binary collision approximation (BCA) and molecular dynamics methods can be used to generate reasonable predictions for the yield and energy distribution of the sputtered atoms. We also find reasonable agreement between the theoretical and experimental results down to impact energies of 600 eV. However, at 200 eV impact energies, significant discrepancies appear between the experimental and theoretical ejecta energy distributions in the peak position, the width of the energy distribution, and the magnitude of the high energy tail. These discrepancies appear to arise from the experimental results being only for atoms sputtered normal to the substrate surface, whereas the theoretical results are integrated over all 2π solid angles above the surface. Using the BCA code SDTrimSP and limiting the results to only atoms emitted within ±15° of the surface normal brings theory and experiment into reasonable agreement. These results suggest that for low energy impacts, the energy distribution of sputtered atoms is highly dependent on the emission angle of the ejecta."

It is a visible and infrared radiometer with a unique panchromatic channel capability designated as a day-night band (DNB). This channel covers wavelengths from 0.5 to 0.9 µm and is designed with a near-constant spatial resolution for Earth observations 24 h a day. The DNB operates at 3 gain stages (low, middle, and high) to cover a large dynamic range. An onboard solar diffuser (SD) is used for calibration in the low gain stage, and to enable the derivation of gain ratios between the different stages. In this paper, we present the SNPP VIIRS DNB calibration performed by the NASA VIIRS characterization support team (VCST). The DNB calibration algorithms are described to generate the calibration coefficient look up tables (LUTs) for the latest NASA Level 1B Collection 2 products. We provide an evaluation of DNB on-orbit calibration performance. This activity supports the NASA Earth science community by delivering consistent VIIRS sensor data products via the Land Science Investigator-led Processing Systems, including the SD degradation applied for DNB calibrations in detector gain and gain ratio trending. The DNB stray light contamination and its correction are highlighted. Performance validations are presented using comparisons to the calibration methods employed by NOAA’s operational Interface Data Processing Segment. Further work on stray light corrections is also discussed."

Clipper’s observations will help provide answers to a broad range of scientific objectives related to Europa’s habitability. As the project proceeds through Phase C, we are building confidence in the system’s ability to achieve these science goals by implementing a rigorous payload verification and validation (V&V) program. This paper details the planned structure and implementation of the Europa Clipper payload V&V program as it exists leading up to the project critical design review (CDR), before the bulk of instrument- or payload- level V&V activities have begun. We first explain the context for payload V&V on Europa Clipper, including its interfaces with other parts of the project system. We then describe the taxonomy of V&V concepts and their interrelationships, followed by a discussion on how this framework allows us to codify interfaces, processes, and ideas that are key to a successful V&V program. We focus on key aspects of the planning phases of V&V, especially establishing a complete set of verification items and accurately mapping them into appropriate verification activities. The second half of the paper describes the logistics of implementing this framework onto our actual payload system, including the processes and tools we use to manage and communicate agreements, changes, and risks across the project. We conclude with a reflection on the unique drivers and challenges of the V&V program concept development so far and the work that is planned for phase D implementation."

Using Multi-Reward Proximal Policy Optimiza- tion, multiple policies are simultaneously and efficiently trained on three distinct trajectory design scenarios. Each policy is trained to create a unique control scheme based on the trajectory design scenario and assigned reward function: a unique combination of weights scaling competing objectives that guide the spacecraft to the target mission orbit, incentivize faster flight times, and penalize propellant mass usage. Then, the policies are evaluated on the same set of perturbed initial conditions in each scenario to generate the propellant mass usages, flight times, and state discontinuities from a reference trajectory for each control scheme. This solution space of low-thrust trajectories for a SmallSat is used to examine the multi-objective trade space for the trajectory design scenario. By autonomously constructing the solution space, insights into the required propellant mass, flight time, and transfer geometry are rapidly achieved."

Historically, CETs have been designed to function with all team members physically collocated. In order to continue operating during the coronavirus pandemic, these teams have had to become fully distributed in 2020. Previously, distributed CETs were predicted to be considerably less efficient than traditional CETs. However, at JPL studies are being successfully run at peak rate in a distributed mode. As nominal working conditions resume after the pandemic, a major question is whether these teams must go back to being fully collocated or if they can become successful hybrid teams, with half or more of the engineers working remotely. In order to address this question, it is important to understand the key characteristics that make a CET more likely to be successful in a remote mode. This paper revisits a framework for characterizing concurrent engineering teams, providing a means to describe and compare the behavior of concurrent engineering teams in various settings [1], and uses the framework to make recommendations for future hybrid teams."

MapRelative Localization is the process of determining the horizontalposition of a lander with respect to an onboard, a-priori map,by comparing the map to sensor observations of the terrain duringdeorbit, descent, and landing (DDL). Although kilometerscaleposition knowledge is commonly available during DDL,landing in hazard-rich environments requires position errors of100 m or less. Prior knowledge in the case of Europa Landerwill be visual and topographic maps collected by the upcomingEuropa Clipper mission. The Mars 2020 Lander Vision System(LVS) uses images from a camera to localize with respect tovisual maps. This technology, as well as a 3D imaging LiDAR indevelopment for hazard detection, is currently baselined for theEuropa Lander Pre-Phase A concept. This paper investigatesthe potential use of the hazard detection LiDAR to performMRL with respect to a 3D digital elevation model (DEM)provided by the Europa Clipper mission, as an alternative orbackup solution to passive optical MRL. Compared to passiveoptical MRL, one advantage of LiDAR-based localization isthat it is insensitive to lighting conditions, potentially relaxingrequirements on synchronizing map acquisition and landingtime of day. To analyze LiDAR based MRL performance,six representative terrains are synthetically up-sampled fromGalileo-derived maps of Europa to a resolution of 0.5 m/pxand covering an area of 4 km by 4 km. These maps are usedas ground-truth to generate simulated noisy a-priori onboardtopographic maps expected from Europa Clipper as well assimulated LiDAR DEMs generated at an altitude of 5 km duringEuropa Lander DDL. The simulated LiDAR DEM is matchedagainst the simulated map via 2D normalized cross-correlation,exploiting the accurately known spacecraft attitude to avoidthe need for more computationally intensive algorithms such asIterative Closest Point (ICP). Two sources of measurement errorare identified for analysis: 1) additive Gaussian noise in therange measurements from the Europa Lander LiDAR and theEuropa Clipper derived maps and 2) errors in the LiDAR DEMinduced by errors in the Europa Lander state estimate which isused to de-warp the LiDAR scan data into a DEM format. Weassess the effect of each of these types of errors independently onmatching performance as well as the overall performance whenall types of error are introduced. Additionally, we present theresult of a sensitivity study to terrain frequency content."

In a very shortperiod, the team developed procedures and executed a remoteoperations readiness test in parallel with the team's support fornominal operations. Continuing regular rover operations withan entirely remote team had not previously been consideredfeasible due to a variety of factors. These included both thehuman factors, such as multiple concurrent person-to-personinteractions of the uplink planning team, as well as technicalfactors, such as reliance on powerful workstations dedicated tographically intensive software tools used for planning. The testwas conducted on March 12th, with both the downlink anduplink teams successfully simulating a near full planning day.The JPL administration announced the transition to mandatorytelework on Monday, March 16th. MSL stood down the uplinkplanning originally scheduled for the next day while downlinkcontinued monitoring the rover. Full operations then resumedper schedule with nearly the entire operations team teleworkingon Friday, March 20th, during which the team planned roveractivities for three Martian days (sols). These activities includedthe successful drilling of the ""Edinburgh"" rock target, a highlycomplex contact science activity.As of October 1st, 2020, the Mars Science Laboratory missionoperations team has conducted 88 remote tactical uplink shiftsfor a total of 190 sols of planned rover activity, which accountsfor more than 6% of the mission to date.

In response, NASA commissioned a multi-center Surface Deformation and Change (SDC) team to perform a five year study of mission architectures that would support SDC observables and provide the most value to the diverse science and applications communities it serves. The study is being conducted in phases, in which the science and applications capabilities identified in the Decadal Survey are interpreted and refined, candidate mission architectures and associated technologies to support these needs are identified, architectures are assessed against a science value framework specific to SDC, and recommendations to NASA are made. Ultimately, NASA will decide which amongst these recommendations will proceed to mission formulation. As synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was identified as the prime sensor technology to satisfy SDC observational needs, a key component of the SDC study is to assess the current state of the art in SAR sensor and spacecraft systems and components. The number of SAR systems, both civil and commercial, is growing rapidly, requiring that mission architectures not only consider technology, but availability of data from other missions, possible partnerships or collaborations, and even data purchase. The mechanism for assessment involves development of an end-to-end science performance evaluation tool for multi-satellite constellations, which feeds into a science value framework that considers science performance, technological programmatic risks, and cost. This paper will present an overview of the ongoing study including the architectures under consideration and the technology road map needed to achieve the objectives of the mission."

Many previous deep space missions have made use of ground-simulation of sequenced commanding, at speeds far greater than real time, to predict spacecraft state over time through the execution of onboard sequences. This type of modeling can be done at any fidelity, and most missions have opted to decrease fidelity to reduce cost and complexity. However, NASA’s Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission expanded the scope of ground modeling considerably, which has led to numerous benefits over past implementations. This paper will discuss the process and products that InSight created, as well as the lessons learned from successfully operating the spacecraft on Mars. InSight is the first JPL mission to expand the scope of ground modeling to include the uplink of files from Earth to the spacecraft, rather than making the simplification that any command sequences already exist onboard the spacecraft. The advantages of modeling the uplink of files are numerous. First, it allows for accurate modeling of the onboard filesystem of the spacecraft at all points in time, meaning that all file loads and deletions throughout the mission are modeled at the exact moment they are predicted to actually happen. Second, operators can be more certain that dependencies between sequences are not broken due to the dynamic nature of the filesystem as files are deleted, copied, and uplinked. Lastly, spacecraft filesystem tracking allows for management of sequences prior to uplink, limiting the uplink to only new sequences. The onboard filesystem model became crucial to mission success, emphasizing the importance of investing in accurate models before the need for them arises. During daily tactical operations of a spacecraft on Mars, a model is only useful if the results can be interpreted quickly. In this fast-paced environment, it is essential that command products are modeled and reviewed, errors are found and diagnosed, and new command products are redelivered, remodeled, re-reviewed in a timely manner. It is impossible to review the entire model and therefore the results of the model must be condensed and presented in a fashion that is intuitive, easy-to-navigate, complete, and trustworthy. InSight developed a number of innovative sequence review products that are designed to provide operators with the information required to quickly assess the validity of command products and diagnose potential issues. Together, these products provide a complete, yet succinct picture of the command and sequence model to the operators and facilitate a quick assessment of all sequence command products. This paper will cover planning and sequencing innovations made during InSight surface operations, and will compare the tools, processes, and results to those on other missions. Additionally, the paper will cover the flexible, yet robust nature of the planning and sequencing system architecture and how that flexibility allowed for rapid development and response to the unpredictability of Mars."

The purpose of SHIELD is to provide a low-cost option to deliver up to 6 kg of science payload to the surface of Mars. SHIELD could be launched as a hosted payload, rideshare on as a secondary payload adapter, or launching from a dedicated small launch vehicle using a kick stage to get to Mars. In order to enable delivery of low cost, SHIELD uses a large diameter deployed drag surface (> 2 m diameter) and low entry mass (< 50 kg) to achieve a very low ballistic coefficient (< 10 kg/m^2): this low ballistic coefficient results in low terminal velocity (< 70 m/sec) without requiring a parachute. Upon impacting the Martian surface at terminal velocity, SHIELD uses a mechanism to decelerate the payload to rest in a robust and predictable manner that limits acceleration of the payload to < 2000 g with a duration less than 8 milliseconds. The SHIELD concept payload subsystem includes a “ruggedized” small warm electronics box (WEB). The WEB houses the telecommunications, command and data handling, thermal control, electrical power, and payload subsystems while maintaining an internal operating temperature ranging between -20° to 20° C. The system is designed to survive the Martian night by utilizing electric heaters powered in a highly insulated box that is powered solar cells and secondary batteries. The WEB is designed to be impact resistant, capable of surviving an impact acceleration pulse equal to or less than 2000 g’s."

After successfully completing its 90-day primary mission that demonstrated arcsecond-level line-of-sight pointing and focal plane thermal stability for exoplanet detection, it entered an extended mission performing onboard software demonstrations to mature technology both in space and on the ground. One of the technologies was a completely cloud-based ground system leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) Ground Station service. Announced in December 2018 and launched in May 2019, AWS Ground Station is a fully managed ground station service that aims to reduce the overhead associated with developing and maintaining ground system infrastructure throughout the mission lifecycle. AWS Ground Station makes available the suite of features required for any ground system in support of low-Earth orbit (LEO) and medium-Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite operations on-demand and without setting up or maintaining long-term contracts. Charges are incurred on a per-minute basis for antenna usage during scheduled tracks. Support is available for S-band uplink and downlink, along with X-band narrowband and wideband downlink. Missions that use the service may reserve tracks with any licensed AWS Ground Station antennas located across each service region and have direct access to any AWS services in support of mission operations. The cloud-based architecture built around the AWS Ground Station service greatly enhanced ASTERIA mission operations by enabling end-to-end pass automation, on-demand contact scheduling and contingency planning, along with more efficient data downlink through station availability and station-tostation handovers. It incorporated open-source software, particularly NASA's AMMOS Instrument Toolkit (AIT) and Open Mission Control Technologies (OpenMCT), along with the AWS application programming interfaces (API) to the Ground Station, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Simple Storage Service (S3) services. After showcasing operability in August 2019, the team continued using and improving this novel ground system architecture until the end of mission in December 2019. This paper describes the cloud-based ground system, how it was designed, tested, and evaluated with an inorbit spacecraft, the operational capabilities that it enabled, along with lessons learned and recommendations for future missions."

The 2007 Anaktuvuk River fire was used as a case study. At 10-year post-fire, we observed a strong increase (>~4 dB) in both the P- and L-band radar backscatter in the severely burned areas, in contrast to limited backscatter differences (VV, VH) between burned and unburned areas at C-band. The polarimetric target decomposition analysis indicated a general trend towards more random surface scattering, and strong increases of the double-bounce and volumetric scattering power at both P- and L-band in the burned areas. Large differences were also observed in the Pauli phase angle and the dominant-scattering-type Touzi phase angle between the burned and unburned areas. The above changes are likely caused by increasing surface roughness and microtopography due to thermokarst development and ice degradation, and increasing subsurface scattering due to an overall drier and deeper active layer in the burned areas"

The work was motivated by the need for new regenerative water purification technologies to enable long-duration space missions. Osmotic membrane bioreactors may be an option for water and nutrient recovery in space if they can attain high water flux and reverse solute flux selectivity (RSFS), which quantifies the mass of permeated water per mass of draw solute that has diffused from the draw solution into a bioreactor. Water flux was measured in a direct flow system using wastewater from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and draw solutions prepared with two polyelectrolytes at different concentrations. The direct flow tests displayed a high initial flux (>10 L/m2/h) that decreased rapidly as solids accumulated on the feed side of the membrane. A test with deionized water as the feed revealed a small mass of polyelectrolyte crossover from the draw solution to the feed, yielding an RSFS of 80. Crossflow filtration experiments demonstrated that steady state flux above 2 L/m2·h could be maintained for 70 h following an initial flux decline due to the formation of a foulant cake layer. This study established that FO could be feasible for regenerative water purification from bioreactors. By utilizing a polyelectrolyte draw solute with high RSFS, we expect to overcome the need for draw solute replenishment. This would be a major step towards sustainable operation in long-duration space missions."

This study first evaluates the phase discrimination performance in four remote sensing datasets, including observations from ground radar, spaceborne radars, and spaceborne radiometer, relative to ground observations. Results show that the snowfall discrimination accuracy varies greatly among these datasets ranging from 42% to 96%, dependent on whether and how the temperature information are considered. For example, over half of the snowfall from the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) spaceborne radar is actually rainfall at the surface since it detects snowfall in the air without considering the temperature information close to the surface. Second, we evaluate the discrimination performance using the temperature information from four reanalysis datasets. It is found that MERRA2 temperature close to the surface is colder than the other three datasets, leading to more rainfall being misclassified as snowfall."

Of these three, the most challenging to determine is thickness. Ideally, the needed information would be provided by remote sensing instruments, particularly those operating from space. In this study we consider the capability of L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for identifying oil layer thickness for slicks in open water given the range of oil properties and environmental conditions typical in this setting. The goal is to determine layer thickness with precision equivalent to that of the Bonn Agreement Oil Appearance Code. Here we report preliminary results of an ongoing study to determine whether either relative or absolute slick thickness can be determined from L-band SAR. The study has an experimental component, which uses low noise airborne SAR data acquired over slicks to evaluate the capability to determine relative thickness, i.e., to differentiate sheen from zones of varying thicker oil within a slick. The component of the study to evaluate whether absolute thickness can be determined from SAR uses backscatter simulations within a physics- based model of electromagnetic scattering from slicked and unslicked ocean surfaces accounting for oil properties, meteorological conditions, and sea state. As part of the theoretical component of the study, we evaluate the backscatter sensitivity to oil characteristics to determine which properties most influenced the SAR measurements. These results are used to determine whether the oil-to-water ratio or the oil thickness can be quantified with reasonable accuracy based upon SAR backscatter intensities alone or whether it requires calibration to go from relative to absolute thickness. The ratio of the backscatter contrast between clean and slicked ocean surfaces is shown to be sensitive to variations within slicks that well correlate with the oil layer thickness. Determination of absolute thickness is much more challenging given the variation of oil properties as the oil weathers on the sea surface."

The structure consists of a single spline profile horn along with a diplexer having orthogonal Ka- and W-band ports and a band pass filter at the Ka band port. The filter is used to achieve high isolation between the Ka- and W-band ports. A directivity of 21 dB and -12 dB beam width of 31 degrees was achieved at Ka-band and a directivity of 26 dB and -12 dB beam width of 21 degrees was achieved at W-band. The overall structure is compact and easy to machine. The dual frequency horn will be tested as part of a Ka/W-band breadboard radar.

Soil moisture is one of the most important factors that influences wildfire occurrences and spread. However, it is also one of the most challenging hydrological variables to measure routinely and accurately.  Therefore, soil moisture is significantly underutilized in    operational wildfire risk applications. Thus, the aim here is to use a well-established operational soil   moisture product to isolate the soil moisture-fire relationship and assess the utility of using soil moisture as a leading indicator of potential fire risk. We evaluated the value of remotely-sensed soil moisture observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) sensor for monitoring and predicting fire risk in Australia and California.  We quantified the relationship between observed fire activity and soil moisture conditions and analyzed the soil moisture conditions for two extreme fire events. Our findings show that fire activity is strongly associated with soil moisture anomalies. Lagged correlation analysis demonstrated that a remote-sensing based soil moisture product could predict fire activity with a 1-2 month lead-time. Soil moisture anomalies consistently decreased in the months preceding fire occurrence, often from normal to drier conditions, according to a spatiotemporal analysis of soil moisture in two extreme fire events. Overall, our findings indicate that soil moisture conditions prior to large wildfires can aid in their prediction and operational satellite-based soil moisture products such as the one used here have real value for supporting wildfire susceptibility and impacts."

It is challenging subject because 1) the problem is oftentimes underdetermined while the measurements are limited and/or incomplete; 2) many combinations of parameters may yield results that are similar with respect to actual response measurements; and 3) uncertainties inevitably exist. The aim of this research is to leverage upon computational intelligence through statistical inference to facilitate an enhanced, probabilistic framework using incomplete modal response measurement. This new framework is built upon efficient inverse identification through optimization, whereas Bayesian inference is employed to account for the effect of uncertainties. To overcome the computational cost barrier, we adopt Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to characterize the target function/distribution. Instead of using single Markov chain in conventional Bayesian approach, we develop a new sampling theory with multiple parallel, interactive and adaptive Markov chains and incorporate it into Bayesian inference. This can harness the collective power of these Markov chains to realize the concurrent search of multiple local optima. The number of required Markov chains and their respective initial model parameters are automatically determined via Monte Carlo simulation-based sample pre-screening followed by K-means clustering analysis. These enhancements can effectively address the aforementioned challenges in finite element inverse analysis. The validity of this framework is systematically demonstrated through case studies."

Boundaries for solar and static RPS architectures remained mostly unchanged. Beyond looking only at demonstrated
mission performance, current funded programs that would change the boundaries further were also
considered. Considering these programs, boundaries for primary batteries, solar, and dynamic RPS do
increase modestly. The investigation of the power level versus distance (AU) revealed the most practical
locations of use for each architecture. Fuel cell use has been concentrated around earth’s orbit as they
provide high power levels for shorter duration. Solar has been demonstrated from very close to the Sun
out to Jupiter as solar power generation levels begin to dissipate. Primary batteries have been
demonstrated in numerous probes from Venus out to Saturn. Finally, static RPS systems have traveled
from Venus out past 150 AU outside the solar system. Considering current funded programs, power levels
for solar do increase at Earth and Jupiter. The investigation of the historical power level change over time
revealed that early assumed chemical power levels were quite high compared to current projections. Solar
power sources appear to have matured over time and seem to have increased as chemical decreased. Static RPS systems have remained relatively stable since their introduction."

This has placed increasing demands on deep space communication and navigation. However, these demands have been met in spite of an essentially level overall budget. One of the reasons for this this has been the continual application of autonomy in various forms. The NASA Deep Space Network’s implementation of “Fol-low the Sun Operations” is a recent example – but certainly not the only one. During this same period, the end-to-end information system has been increasingly automated through the application of packet telemetry and virtual channels. Fully autonomous spacecraft navigation has been demonstrated, and more limited autonomy has been applied to the operational navigation process. This paper will show how autonomy and automation capabilities have been infused into operational deep space mission communication and navigation in both flight and ground systems as appropriate. It will further discuss ongoing work aimed at increasing the level of autonomy in the future, leverag-ing recent research and application of autonomy in everyday life."

This operations breakthrough enabled NASA’s InSight lander to detect the first known ‘marsquake’, a faint trembling of Mars’s surface on 6th April 2019, 128 Martian days after landing on Mars on the 26th November 2018. This is the first quake detected on an astronomical body other than Earth or the Moon. This paper describes the operations of the Robotics Instrument Deployment Systems (IDS) that successfully deployed the InSight science payload to the surface of Mars. The payload includes a seismometer (SEIS), Wind and Thermal Shield (WTS) and Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3), enabling scientists to perform the first comprehensive surface-based geophysical investigation of Mars’ interior structure. In addition, the paper describes the IDS planning and command sequence generation process used for the successful deployment of SEIS, WTS and HP3 on the surface of Mars. The paper concludes with recommendations based on the experience gained from InSight IDS operations. This includes identified technology gaps in the operations of in-situ manipulators for planetary exploration."

Special dielectric materials like static dissipative Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) ESD are under consideration for the Europa Clipper mission. PEEK loaded with carbon nanofibers improves the ESD performance for this material but the RF characteristics are unknown. We have developed a method to characterize the dielectric constant of a material as a function of frequency and temperature down to 30K. We present the measurement results of four samples of ESD. The measured data shows the permittivity of TECAPEEK ESD 11 is in the range of 7 to 10 at HF and in the range of 6.8 to 8.3 for VHF frequencies. The change in permittivity of ESD 11 down to 30 K is less than 7% at HF and less than 3% at VHF frequency. The sample to sample variability can be attributed to the inhomogeneity of the material."

The project goal is to ensure that a full “palette” of flight-ready (high TRL) thermal “toolbox” elements is available so that engineers can create passive, ultra-isolative thermal designs for science instruments on a variety of carriers in lunar/planetary extreme environments. PALETTE is structured to meet the need via four design/build/test tasks and four analysis/study tasks. This paper focuses on Tasks 1-4, the four design/build/test tasks. Task 1 involves the development of nested thermally-switched enclosures featuring a reverse-operation DTE thermal switch (ROD-TSW) in series with a propylene miniaturized loop heat pipe (mini-LHP). Task 2 involves the development of a parabolic reflector radiator (PRR) for low latitude lunar sites. Task 3 involves the development of a low effective emissivity (e*) multilayer insulation (MLI) known as “spacerless” MLI. Finally, Task 4 involves the development of low conductance (G) thermal isolators. Available test results for all four tasks will be summarized in the paper, as will the plans for the remainder of the PALETTE project."

The first is the extended stroke ROD-TSW (ES-ROD-TSW) while the second is the miniaturized ROD-TSW (mini-ROD-TSW). Each employs multiple diametrically nested DTE stages in contrast to the single-stage ROD-TSW. The ES-ROD-TSW employs two stages and a negative CTE material known as Allvar and its main purpose is to extend its stroke for use in non-vacuum planetary environments. The mini-ROD-TSW employs four stages to miniaturize its size for use in compact lunar instruments and rovers. The ES-ROD-TSW was TVAC tested at JPL and its ON/OFF ratio is 13000:1 based on a measured ON conductance of 6.89 W/K and a calculated OFF conductance of 0.00053 W/K. The mini-ROD-TSW is targeted to have an ON conductance of 1.5 W/K and an OFF conductance of 0.0015 W/K, both verified by analysis. Test verification of the mini-ROD-TSW remains to be carried out. The paper will provide design/performance details of each device."

Their data analysis workflow mainly involves identifying mineral com- pounds through the element abundance in spatially distributed data points. Working with the NASA JPL team, we identified pain points and needs to further develop their existing data visualization and analysis tool. Specifically, the team desired improvements for the process of creating and interpreting mineral composition groups. To address this problem, we developed an interactive tool that enables scientists to (1) cluster the data using either manual lasso-tool selection or through various machine learning clustering algorithms, and (2) compare the clusters and individual data points to make informed decisions about mineral compositions. Our preliminary tool supports a hybrid data analysis workflow where the user can manually refine the machine-generated clusters."

We propose a particle production mechanism that could improve the depletion of the inflaton energy density by up to four orders of magnitude. The improvement comes from the fast perturbative decays of resonantly produced daughter particles. They act as a “spillway” to drain these daughter particles, reducing their backreaction on the inflaton and keeping the resonant production effective for a longer period. Thus we dub the scenario “spillway preheating”. We also show that the fraction of energy density remaining in the inflaton has a simple inverse power-law scaling in the scenario. In general, spillway preheating is a much more efficient energy dissipation mechanism, which may have other applications in model building for particle physics."

Problematically, verifying a system specification must be done within the context of changing or even unknown environmental domain knowledge that could render the specification ineffective or incorrect. This issue is even more apparent in the context of self-adaptive systems, where uncertainty in both the system configuration and environment can impact the validity of the system. This paper introduces a method to explicitly model domain knowledge of the environment as a secondary system to enable design-time verification against documented environmental assumptions (i.e., those elements external to the system). In addition, run-time monitors are used to detect scenarios in the actual environment not specified by the modeled environmental domain knowledge. Rather than simply identifying unexpected inputs, our approach is able to identify run-time violations of the environmental domain knowledge, even when inputs appear valid based on the domain assumptions embedded in the system specification. These violations can then be used to correspondingly update the system and environmental specifications via automated run-time adaptation or subsequent design-time revisions. We illustrate our approach by applying our method to a running example of a goal-based model of a baby monitor."
3273,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017856,2023-08-03,Exploration Medical Capability Clinical Decision Support System Concept of Operations,"The Clinical Decision Support (CDS) project supports the Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) Element of the Human Research Program (HRP). Specifically, the CDS project addresses the ExMC gap, Medical-701: Enhance medical capabilities within an exploration medical system. For long-duration, deep space missions, computational and data resources will play an important role in maintaining crew health, wellness and performance where the crew will need to be more self-reliant as we enter a new era in space exploration to return to the moon and explore Mars. These ambitious goals will require significant change in in-flight medical care due to constraints on mass, volume, power, crew time, skills reduction over time and medical evacuation capabilities. These constraints make it absolutely necessary to develop transformative solutions using new technologies. Unlike the current paradigm for crew health in low-Earth orbit missions that rely on constant communication with Mission Control, the deep space missions will experience communication delays and possibly, no communications for finite periods of time. Hence, crew health management will benefit from analytics’ capabilities to augment decision support. 

A comprehensive, multi-functional on-board clinical decision support system (CDSS) will help crews assess and diagnose conditions, decide appropriate responses, and guide the provision of tailored and evidence-based treatments, while reflecting contextual factors and constraints. The context may include present and historical data, viable diagnostic equipment, available supplies and medications, and vehicle and environmental health. Communication time with ground-based personnel is delayed or non-existent during significant portions of the mission so the crew will need to autonomously respond to health, performance and medical situations, particularly those that are unplanned. The CDSS must also provide additional capabilities as complex as training for an emergency situation while augmenting non-expert practitioner skillsets if the Crew Medical Officer (CMO) is incapacitated, and as routine as facilitating delayed communication with flight surgeons on the ground. The CDSS must connect complex issues involving health, wellness, task performance and environmental domains. Furthermore, CDSS functionality will focus on semi-autonomous and autonomous decision-making by the crew that is necessary to address challenges in executing a self-contained medical system that enables health care without assistance from ground clinical experts. The document, ExMC CDSS Architecture Recommendation, (HRP- 48032) establishes a description of the envisioned CDSS architecture. The analytics, descriptive or advanced, contained in a CDSS will interface with the integrated crew health and performance architecture that provides the appropriate data sets. The aim of the CDS project is to develop requirements for a CDSS through a series of test-bed prototype developments and demonstrations."

Secondary processes saw a dramatic increase in the chemical and structural diversity of minerals. These phases incorporate 41 different mineral-forming elements, including the earliest known appearances of species with essential Co, Ge, As, Nb, Ag, Sn, Te, Au, Hg, Pb, and Bi.

However, the successful interpretation of satellite data requires an understanding of how satellites relate to other data sources, as well as factors affecting their application to health challenges. Drawing from the expertise and experience of the 2016–2020 NASA HAQAST (Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences Team), we present a review of satellite data for air quality and health applications. We include a discussion of satellite data for epidemiological studies and health impact assessments, as well as the use of satellite data to evaluate air quality trends, support air quality regulation, characterize smoke from wildfires, and quantify emission sources. The primary advantage of satellite data compared to in situ measurements, e.g., from air quality monitoring stations, is their spatial coverage. Satellite data can reveal where pollution levels are highest around the world, how levels have changed over daily to decadal periods, and where pollutants are transported from urban to global scales. To date, air quality and health applications have primarily utilized satellite observations and satellite-derived products relevant to near-surface particulate matter <2.5 μm in diameter (PM(sub 2.5)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Health and air quality communities have grown increasingly engaged in the use of satellite data, and this trend is expected to continue. From health researchers to air quality managers, and from global applications to community impacts, satellite data are transforming the way air pollution exposure is evaluated."

It is important to understand the central nervous system (CNS) effects of deep spaceflight and the associated unavoidable exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR). Rodent studies show single- or simple-particle combination exposure alters CNS endpoints, including hippocampal-dependent behavior. An even better Earth-based simulation of GCR is now available, consisting of a 33-beam (33-GCR) exposure. However, the effect of whole-body 33-GCR exposure on rodent behavior is unknown, and no 33-GCR CNS countermeasures have been tested. Here astronaut-age-equivalent (6mo-old) C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to 33-GCR (75cGy, a Mars mission dose). Pre-/during/post-Sham or 33-GCR exposure, mice received a diet containing a ‘vehicle’ formulation alone or with the antioxidant/anti-inflammatory compound CDDO-EA as a potential countermeasure. Behavioral testing beginning 4mo post-irradiation suggested radiation and diet did not affect measures of exploration/anxiety-like behaviors (open field, elevated plus maze) or recognition of a novel object. However, in 3-Chamber Social Interaction (3-CSI), CDDO-EA/33-GCR mice failed to spend more time exploring a holder containing a novel mouse vs. a novel object (empty holder), suggesting sociability deficits. Also, Vehicle/33-GCR and CDDO-EA/Sham mice failed to discriminate between a novel stranger vs. familiarized stranger mouse, suggesting blunted preference for social novelty. CDDO-EA given pre-/ during/post-irradiation did not attenuate the 33-GCR-induced blunting of preference for social novelty. Future elucidation of the mechanisms underlying 33-GCR-induced blunting of preference for social novelty will improve risk analysis for astronauts which may in-turn improve countermeasures."

In order to resist this environmental hazard, the analysis will compare various configurations of potential shielding layers using both in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) and Earth-based materials. The technology for implementation of in-situ resources in construction is developing, though not yet able to produce a functional lunar habitat. As the lunar infrastructure is developed, ISRU techniques for manufacturing and construction may become more viable. Therefore, both types of materials are considered due to potential for application towards both near-term and long-term commencements of habitat construction. The thermal analysis in this paper utilizes the nonlinear heat equation to produce a depth-dependent temperature gradient from the habitat exterior to the interior that changes continuously with time during the lunar diurnal cycle. Static loading conditions meant to simulate the impact force of a 77.9 g meteorite were used to analyze the ability of a proposed multilayer shielding configuration to resist impact. A thermal stress analysis was performed to observe the effects of heat transfer through the proposed multilayer configuration. The results of this study should be useful in determining the potential for implementation of efficient shielding layers for the initial lunar base."

This hybrid approach requires the development of a structural model that accounts for various hazards (e.g., micrometeorite and debris impact) and interacts with physical tests and other sub-system models (e.g., thermal) of the space habitat. A two-dimensional finite element analysis code was developed in MATLAB to facilitate the evaluation of potential designs under operating and unexpected loads and prepare the computational framework for eventually performing cyber-physical testing. The code’s efficiency was enhanced by using an object-oriented programming approach that reduced data transfer between functions. In this study, the code is implemented to predict the response of a dome-style structure made of regolith concrete to impact loading and identify the force magnitude that will cause the tensile strength to be exceeded in domes with different thicknesses."

We tabulate 90 igneous differentiated asteroidal minerals, including the earliest known occurrences of minerals with Ba, Cl, Cu, F, and V as essential elements, as well as the first appearances of numerous phosphates, quartz, zircon, and amphibole group minerals. We also record 40 minerals formed through high-pressure impact alteration, commencing with the period of asteroid accretion and differentiation. These stages of mineral evolution thus mark the first time that high pressures, both static and dynamic, played a significant role in mineral paragenesis."

Voyager 2 imaged the southern hemispheres of Uranus’s five largest “classical” moons—Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon, as well as the largest ring moon, Puck—but their northern hemispheres were largely unobservable at the time of the flyby and were not imaged. Additionally, no spatially resolved data sets exist for the other 21 known moons, and their surface properties are essentially unknown. Because Voyager 2 was not equipped with a near-infrared mapping spectrometer, our knowledge of the Uranian moons’ surface compositions, and the processes that modify them, is limited to disk-integrated data sets collected by ground- and space-based telescopes. Nevertheless, images collected by the Imaging Science System on Voyager 2 and reflectance spectra collected by telescope facilities indicate that the five classical moons are candidate ocean worlds that might currently have, or had, liquid subsurface layers beneath their icy surfaces. To determine whether these moons are ocean worlds, and to investigate Uranus’s ring moons and irregular satellites, close-up observations and measurements made by instruments on board a Uranus orbiter are needed."

energy, is often invoked to explain magnetic energy releases powering high-energy flares
in astrophysical sources including pulsar wind nebulae and black hole jets. Reconnection
is usually seen as the (essentially 2D) nonlinear evolution of the tearing instability
disrupting a thin current sheet. To test how this process operates in 3D, we conduct a
comprehensive particle-in-cell simulation study comparing 2D and 3D evolution of long,
thin current sheets in moderately-magnetized, collisionless, relativistically-hot electron-
positron plasma, and find dramatic differences. We first systematically characterize this
process in 2D, where classic, hierarchical plasmoid-chain reconnection determines energy
release, and explore a wide range of initial configurations, guide magnetic field strengths,
and system sizes. We then show that 3D simulations of similar configurations exhibit
a diversity of behaviours, including some where energy release is determined by the
nonlinear relativistic drift-kink instability. Thus, 3D current-sheet evolution is not always
fundamentally classical reconnection with perturbing 3D effects, but, rather, a complex
interplay of multiple linear and nonlinear instabilities whose relative importance depends
sensitively on the ambient plasma, minor configuration details, and even stochastic
events. It often yields slower but longer-lasting and ultimately greater magnetic energy
release than in 2D. Intriguingly, nonthermal particle acceleration is astonishingly robust,
depending on the upstream magnetization and guide field, but otherwise yielding similar
particle energy spectra in 2D and 3D. Though the variety of underlying current-sheet
behaviours is interesting, the similarities in overall energy release and particle spectra
may be more remarkable."

The Cross-platform HIgh resolution Multi-instrument AtmosphEric Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMAERA) system addresses the latter aspect of the inter-sensor continuity problem for cloud property retrievals by removing retrieval methodology and implementation as a source of inconsistency when applied to instruments that share common measurement capabilities. Transferring an existing retrieval algorithm to a new sensor oftentimes is a nontrivial task, as it is common for an algorithm code to be tightly coupled to the sensor for which it was developed. By creating a clear division between the science algorithm and the instrument I/O codes, CHIMAERA allows easy migration of science algorithms to different sensors. CHIMAERA is built from C and FORTRAN source code, and can operate in a variety of environments ranging from a personal laptop to a high-performance computing environment for near real-time satellite data production. It is highly adaptable, low-maintenance and allows for easy expansion such that adding new instruments into the system requires only instrument-specific I/O and provision of any external lookup tables specific to the instrument's spectral characteristics. CHIMAERA currently supports 14 spaceborne and airborne atmospheric imagers from a single code base, and has been in use since 2007. In this paper we describe the engineering aspects of CHIMAERA and briefly discuss a few examples from its many current applications."

The machine learning text mining tools–latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence—are used to provide topic clusters to the user. Topic clusters are the underlying themes of a paper. For the text modeling problem, NMF-KL is the equivalent of probabilistic latent semantic analysis. Both LDA and NMF-KL are top-performing modeling tools. These tools are used to identify biological specimens relevant to the user. Various organisms solve a particular survival problem in nature differently. The topic clusters allow people without domain expertise to find these cross-topic themes in the body of documents and then branch out and examine papers whose target organisms solve the engineer’s problem. Abstracts from the Journal of Experimental Biology were used as input for the clustering tool in addition to a curated set of articles for validation. The tool is able to accept alternate input sources."

A strategic scan of the aerospace environment at the beginning of the 21st century strongly suggests that the world might be approaching a new age of airpower—the era of electrified/hybrid aircraft propulsion. Undeniably, starting from the Montgolfier Brothers balloon flight in 1783, to the Wright Brothers piston engine flight in 1903, and the jet engine of the 1960s, or the space age of today, one can say that leaps in propulsion technology have marked the different ages of human flight. The technological advancements, brought at the beginning of 21st century by the revolution in data exchange, computational power, sensors, wireless communication, internet, and autonomy, contributed to the vision of this new age of propulsion we are approaching.

Historically, conventional vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft have been equipped with propulsion units relying on complex internal combustion machines (turbines, piston engines, for example), and complex mechanical arrangements (gearboxes, shafts, variable pitch propeller). By contrast, electric VTOL aircraft (eVTOL)1 rely on simpler propulsion units (electric motors and in some cases fixed-pitch propellers). This promotes redundancy and improves tolerance to failures, in turn improving safety. The use of simpler electric propulsion units should also allow significant acquisition and operating cost reductions. Whether full-electric (relying solely on batteries) or hybrid-electric (relying on a combination of batteries, fuel-powered engines, and generators.), eVTOLs are also expected to generate less noise and air pollution than conventional aircraft with similar payloads.

According to the 2019 Annual Review of IATA (International Air Transport Association) [ref.1], due to an expected increase in air transport traffic by 5% every year and a doubling of air transport passenger numbers to 8.2 billion by 2037 significant challenges are posed to the aviation industry. Furthermore, this report does not factor in the expected demand for short-range (intra-city) air transportation, which is in development and yet to be operational. The increased demand to fly creates a responsibility to expand in a sustainable manner and an endeavor to develop more environmentally-friendly aircraft. eVTOL aircraft, either piloted or autonomous, is gathering considerable interest worldwide. Modern and novel full-electric or hybrid-electric eVTOL configurations enable a new paradigm shift in air transportation as the aviation industry remains committed to its goals of carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onwards and cutting CO2 emissions to half 2005 levels by 2050.

While electric power has been used for decades, recent developments in mobile electric/hybrid propulsion coupled with advanced materials and autonomous systems may create the possibility to transition into the next age of air mobility propelled by electric/hybrid VTOL aircraft technology. Although eVTOL aircraft might seem like an incremental improvement or even a counterintuitive regression with regard to past VTOL development, it has in fact the potential to transform air mobility across a wide range of government applications. Previous transformations in aviation generated dramatic leaps in performance, but the cost was commensurate with performance, limiting quantity produced. This next age appears to take a different approach. Performance may not increase, but at this moment technology is poised for future urban mobility that will spawn commercial passenger drone services, that is, autonomous (pilotless) air taxis and thereby add a new dimension to the urban transportation mix of the future [ref. 2]. Advances in electric propulsion, autonomous flight technology, and 5G communication networks will enable this fast new-growing market to become a reality.

It is now time to envision the introduction of electric/hybrid eVTOL aircraft for Public Services2. We believe that in the next decades eVTOL aircraft will have the potential to become an essential tool to Public Service agencies around the world in applications such as firefighting, public safety, search and rescue, disaster relief and law enforcement. This is due to several major factors.

          • First, with the increasing popularity of small, unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) or drones, many companies today are focusing on the development of passenger UAVs designed to accommodate up to five passengers or equivalent cargo payload. Many such configurations are electric or hybrid-electric designs with VTOL capabilities. Several of these projects have started a flight test program and many more are expected to be in the experimental and development phase in 2020. Such revolutionary vehicles could be in commercial operations by 2030. These eVTOL systems could be ready for selected Public Services missions even sooner.
          • Second, although these advanced eVTOL vehicles under development still need access to fuel (hybrid) and/or electric charging capability, they can take off and land from almost anywhere. Therefore, such vehicles, both manned and unmanned can be successfully integrated for the critical missions of the Public Services with extra deployment flexibilities.
          • Third, advancement in electric propulsion systems in the automotive industry together with NASA’s leading efforts in electrification of aircraft propulsion systems, FAA’s ongoing active eVTOL certification programs, and EASA’s proposed framework for the certification of electric/hybrid small category VTOL aircraft in Europe [ref. 3] will help accelerate industry electric propulsion system development and integration.
          • Finally, eVTOL vehicles could be deployed for Public Services sooner than air taxi or other commercial applications, since Public Services missions may be more easily approved based on specific mission criteria, localized airworthiness authority for public-use aircraft3, and are normally operating under centralized airspace management and control by the theater command. Moreover, public perception and acceptance are generally less of a concern when operations save lives and benefit the wider community.

The prioritized introduction of eVTOL aircraft in Public Services is ambitious, but we believe it is achievable in the coming decades if fundamental enablers (people and technologies) are engaged in defining the objectives and needs of these missions. The revolution that is currently taking place in eVTOL aircraft represents an unprecedented opportunity to develop a safer, more affordable, more available and more environmentally friendly future of vertical flight. To ensure that these novel aircraft meet the future expectations of Public Services, it is essential to take a collaborative and multi-disciplinary approach to their development, across engineering disciplines, policy-making, program management, business case development, manufacturing, and flight demonstrations.

It should be noted that the term eVTOL (in the near term) used throughout this publication implies aircraft capable of transporting up to 5 persons which may or may not include a pilot if operated fully autonomously, assuming an average of 200 pounds (91 kg) per person or equivalent payload and a range up to 60 miles plus a suitable reserve. Hybrid or hydrogen powered eVTOLs would have greater range. For example, a “3-seat” eVTOL aircraft may only be able to carry two fully equipped firemen, and payload capacity is more relevant when used for the supply mission. Moreover, this paper concentrates on the “last-mile” solutions with a deployment time of no more than 6 hours. Although not specifically discussed in this document, it is understood that the future of Transformative Vertical Flight in general and Public Services, in particular, will also involve smaller UAVs that will undoubtedly play a crucial role in future aerial operations. For example, smaller unmanned aircraft may be used to dispatch medical supplies, portable filtration systems or perform the Search task of future Search and Rescue (SAR) operations.

Close collaboration between the aircraft industry, the Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA), e.g., Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA) and the Department of Defense (DoD) certifiers, will help identify Public Services requirements, define expectations and limit development cost and timescales. Take the US Air Force Agility Prime as an example, the majority of the eVTOL application opportunities and mission elements identified are in line with the NASA TVF WG-4 objectives and use cases. Together, it forms a strong partnership to accelerate the development, certification, and practical deployment for public service missions.

The US Air Force Agility Prime has been a collaboration partner on this white paper, and provided valuable input and recommendations. Most of the eVTOL public service mission elements discussed in this paper and additional use cases envisioned by the NASA TVF WG-4 team are shared by the Agility Prime program. The focus and efforts of the Agility Prime in product and system development, industry and government partnership, accelerated certifications as well as early test and deployment are totally in sync with the path forward recommended by this white paper. This kind of collaboration and partnership will help enable the practical use of the eVTOL for public service missions, benefit the eVTOL public acceptance, and accelerate the eVTOL industry revolution."

The primary element shape was a pair of elliptical planform ramps that were inclined at equal and opposite angles with respect to the local streamwise direction. The element shapes were designed to induce transient growth disturbances that would lead to sustained azimuthal modulation of the boundary layer flow while limiting the nearfield disturbances to avoid an immediate, i.e., effective tripping of the boundary layer. The bulk of the run matrix consisted of testing different element height sat free stream unit Reynolds numbers ranging from 9.8 to 13.1 million per meter. Other element shapes previously designed for tripping hypersonic boundary layers were also implemented. The model was instrumented with surface mounted Kulite<sup>®</sup> and PCB<sup>®</sup> pressure transducers and thermocouples. Spectra from the PCBs<sup>®</sup> indicated clear suppression of the second-mode instability; however, neither the PCB<sup>®</sup> spectra nor the heat transfer data presented strong evidence for delayed turbulent flow. Complementary stability computations likewise demonstrated second-mode reduction, particularly just downstream of the roughness, but also revealed a rise in first mode (streak-instability) amplitudes from the baseline that was likely responsible for the earlier transition observed for taller roughness cases."

FTEs often consist of two interlinked flux tubes, but, local kinetic processes between the flux tubes are not understood in the context of the FTE structuring, evolution, and impact. An FTE observed by MMS on 18 December 2017 consisted of two flux tubes of different topology. One includes field lines with ends connected to the northern and southern hemispheres while the other includes field lines with both ends connected to the magnetosheath. Reconnection occurring at the flux-tube interface indicates how interacting flux tubes evolve into a flux rope with helical magnetic topology that is either closed or open. This study demonstrates a new aspect of how micro-to meso-scale dynamics occurring within FTEs determines their macroscale characteristics and evolution."

Between late August to mid- September 2019, the stratospheric circumpolar westerly jet weakened rapidly, and Antarctic stratospheric temperatures rose dramatically. The deceleration of the vortex at 10 hPa was as drastic as that of the first ever observed major sudden stratospheric warming in the SH during 2002, while the mean Antarctic warming over the course of spring 2019 broke the previous record of 2002 by ~50% in the mid-stratosphere. This event was preceded by a poleward shift of the SH polar night jet in the uppermost stratosphere in early winter, which was then followed by record-strong planetary wave-one activity propagating upward from the troposphere in August that acted to dramatically weaken the polar vortex throughout the depth of the stratosphere. The weakened vortex winds and elevated temperatures moved downward to the surface from mid-October to December, promoting a record strong swing of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) to its negative phase. This record-negative SAM appeared to be a primary driver of the extreme hot and dry conditions over subtropical eastern Australia that accompanied the severe wildfires that occurred in late spring 2019. State-of-the-art dynamical seasonal forecast systems skillfully predicted the significant vortex weakening of spring 2019 and subsequent development of negative SAM from as early as late July."

Herein, machine learning surrogate models and the approximate coordinate exchange (ACE) algorithm are used to determine optimum experimental designs over large or arbitrarily restrictive design spaces. Optimal experimental design is particularly salient in materials science where experiments are expensive and material properties must often be inferred indirectly. The proposed framework is demonstrated by finding optimal experiments with which the hidden constituent properties of composite materials can be most efficiently inferred from observable experimental outcomes. The optimum experimental design is given by an information-theoretic criteria, which maximizes the conditional mutual information between the hidden properties and the expected experimental outcomes. To perform tractable optimization a neural network is trained as a surrogate model to mimic a physics based simulation, which can calculate the expected experimental outcome based on a candidate experimental design and sampled constituent properties. The ACE algorithm is used to optimize over large design spaces with many tests and controlled parameters where an exhaustive search would be intractable even with the surrogate model. Using this approach, optimal experimental designs that are consistent with those produced by heuristic knowledge and established best practices are found; then optimal designs in larger design spaces where heuristic knowledge is unavailable are examined."

Despite being large metropolises, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), population 14.3 million, and Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo (ROC), population 2.4 million, have no reference air pollution monitors at the time of writing. Recently, a few reference monitors have been deployed in other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, including Kampala, Uganda. A low-cost PurpleAir PM2.5 monitor was collocated next to the Kampala US Embassy BAM-1020 (Met One Beta Attenuation Monitor) starting in August 2019. Raw PurpleAir data are strongly correlated with the BAM (r(exp 2) = 0.88), but have a mean absolute error of approximately 14 μg/cu.m. Two calibration models, multiple linear regression and a random forest approach, decrease mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.3 μg/cu.m to 3.4 µg/cu.m or less and improve the the r(exp 2) from 0.88 to 0.96. Given )the similarity in climate and emissions in Kampala, we apply the collocated field correction factors to four PurpleAir sensors in Kinshasa, DRC and one in neighboring Brazzaville, ROC deployed beginning April 2018. Annual average PM2.5 for 2019 in Kinshasa is estimated at 43.5 µg/cu.m, more than 4 times higher than WHO Interim Target 1 of 10 µg/cu.m. Surface PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth were each about 40% lower during the 2020 COVID19 lockdown period compared to the same time period in 2019, which cannot be explained by changes in meteorology or wildfire emissions alone. Our results highlight the need for clean air solutions implementation in the Congo."

The idea has been employed in practice to perform zero-propellant maneuvers on the International Space Station and minimum time maneuvers on NASA’s TRACE space telescope. A challenge for operational implementation of the idea is the
finite capacity of a space vehicle’s command storage buffer. One approach to mitigate the problem is to downsample-and-hold the attitude commands so that the attitude control system to follows a set of waypoints. This paper explores the waypoint following dynamics of a quaternion error feedback control law for downsample-and-hold. It is shown that downsample-and-hold induces a ripple between downsamples that causes the satellite angular rate to significantly overshoot the desired limit. Analysis in the z-domain is carried out in order to understand the phenomenon. An interpolating Chebyshev-type filter is proposed that allows attitude commands to be encoded in terms of a small set of filter coefficients. Using the interpolating filter, commands can be issued at the ACS rate but with significantly reduced memory requirements. The attitude control system of NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is used as an example to illustrate the behavior of a practical attitude control system."

Then, PC-TAU histograms from current-climate CMIP6 model simulations are assigned to the ISCCP-H WSs along with their concurrent radiation and precipitation properties, to evaluate model cloud, radiation, and precipitation properties in the context of the Weather States. The new ISCCP-H analysis produces WSs that are very similar to those previously found in the lower resolution ISCCP-D dataset. The main difference lies in the splitting of the ISCCP-D thin stratocumulus WS between the ISCCP-H shallow cumulus and stratocumulus WSs, which results in the reduction by one of the total WS number. The evaluation of the CMIP6 models against the ISCCP-H Weather States, shows that, in the ensemble mean, the models are producing an adequate representation of the frequency and geographical distribution of the WSs, with measurable improvements compared to the WSs derived for the CMIP5 ensemble. However, the frequency of shallow cumulus clouds continues to be underestimated, and, in some WSs the good agreement of the ensemble mean with observations comes from averaging models that significantly overpredict and underpredict the ISCCP-H WS frequency. In addition, significant biases exist in the internal cloud properties of the model WSs, such as the model underestimation of cloud fraction in middle-top clouds and secondarily in midlatitude storm and stratocumulus clouds, that result in an underestimation of cloud SW cooling in those regimes."

Several statistical parameters were used to assess the performance of the TestBed distributed system such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of latency, and update rate for aircraft state messages that are transmitted through the simulated system under investigation.

It is necessary to assess the performance characteristics of distributed systems in terms of the indicated statistical parameters mentioned above. It is critical to verify the system performance with respect to a researcher’s required system performance. Computer host specifications are documented in terms of Central Processing Unit (CPU) clock speed and core count. Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) message protocol was used for data transmission. The system network topology also contributes to the latency and update rate variations from the one imposed by the data source.

The motivation for selecting the TestBed infrastructure as the focus of this study can be attributed to the number of services and capabilities it provides that help simplify the process of preparing and conducting a simulation. These capabilities include an easy to use GUI for simulation configuration, access to TestBed library by the end-user of other simulation software components, a modular adapter paradigm that allows simple connectivity of external software to TestBed, connectivity with other simulation laboratories, and a Software Development Kit (SDK) for quicker development.

Two types of traffic generators, Air Traffic Generator (ATG) and Multi Aircraft Control System (MACS) were used to generate messages that were injected into the TestBed distributed environment. Eight different air traffic scenarios with progressively increasing loads were generated for each air traffic simulator. The corresponding air traffic loads between the two simulators had an identical number of aircraft per scenario, but different flight plans.
It was observed that the performance of MACS degraded for air traffic scenarios containing more than 200 aircraft (37.5 KB/s nominal throughput). However, ATG performed adequately under all tested air traffic loads up to 1200 aircraft (225. KB/s nominal throughput). The tests show that MACS exhibits better latency performance with smaller aircraft loads when compared to ATG. The tests also show that the TestBed infrastructure successfully transmits 1200 aircraft without significant degradation of its performance. From the latency trends for both MACS and ATG, it is clear that as aircraft load increases, the latency in the system increases as well as its standard deviation.
Likewise, the trends for the update data rate for both MACS and ATG show that as the aircraft load increases, so does the standard deviation and mean of the update rates which can be attributed to the performance of MACS and ATG applications. The analysis of the results of this study have proven that the overall system performance is dependent on the individual performance of each system component that is connected to TestBed, which subsequently propagates into the system.

All TestBed characterization tests were conducted in SimLabs at NASA Ames Research Center in November 2019. This study addresses the need for a baseline TestBed characterization, and the results will serve as a reference for more complex simulation systems."

We add to these ground-based, HST, and K2 transit-time measurements, and revisit an N-body dynamical analysis of the seven-planet system using our complete set of times from which we refine the mass ratios of the planets to the star. We next carry out a photodynamical analysis of the Spitzer light curves to derive the density of the host starand the planet densities. We find that all seven planets’ densities may be described with a single rocky mass–radius relation which is depleted in iron relative to Earth, with Fe 21 wt% versus 32 wt% for Earth, and otherwise Earth-like in composition. Alternatively, the planets may have an Earth-like composition but enhanced in light elements,such as a surface water layer or a core-free structure with oxidized iron in the mantle. We measure planet masses toa precision of 3%–5%, equivalent to a radial-velocity(RV)precision of 2.5 cm s−1, or two orders of magnitude more precise than current RV capabilities. We find the eccentricities of the planets are very small, the orbits are extremely coplanar, and the system is stable on 10 Myr timescales. We find evidence of infrequent timing outliers, which we cannot explain with an eighth planet; we instead account for the outliers using a robust likelihood function. We forecast JWST timing observations and speculate on possible implications of the planet densities forthe formation, migration, and evolution of the planet system."

This work, Part 2 of a 2-part   paper   series,   provides   an   overview   of   the   atmospheric   circulation,   boundary   layer variability, three-dimensional cloud structure, and precipitation over the WNAO; the companion paper (Part 1) focused on chemical characterization of aerosols, gases, and wet deposition.Seasonal   changes   in   atmospheric   circulation   and   sea   surface   temperature   explain   a   clear transition in cloud morphologies from small shallow cumulus clouds, convective clouds, and tropical storms in summer, to stratus/stratocumulus and multi-layer cloud systems associated with winter storms. Synoptic variability in cloud fields is estimated using satellite-based weather states, and the role of postfrontal conditions (cold-air outbreaks) in the development of stratiform clouds is further analyzed. Precipitation is persistent over the ocean, with a regional peak over the Gulf Stream path, where offshore sea surface temperature gradients are large and surface fluxes reach a regional peak. Satellite data show a clear annual cycle in cloud droplet number concentration with maxima (minima) along the coast in winter (summer), suggesting a marked annual cycle in aerosol-cloud interactions. Compared with satellite cloud retrievals, four climate models qualitatively reproduce the annual cycle in cloud cover and liquid water path, but with large discrepancies across models, especially in the extra-tropics. The paper concludes with a summary of outstanding issues and recommendations for future work."

Unfortunately, the orbit design process for constellations can be significantly more involved, especiallywhen the relative placement of the individual spacecraft within the constellation is not constrained by mission and/or science objectives. Optimizing a satellite constellation in the presence of multiple, competing objectives is a highly complex problem to which many traditional mathematical optimization methods cannot be applied and few tools exist to help mission designers search for promising candidate mission designs. The Generation-based Evolutionary Tool for the Optimization of Constellations (GenETOC) has been created to search for near-optimal constellation design options. GenETOC combines a modified version of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) with STK Components libraries (a 3rdparty .NET package created by Analytical Graphics Inc.) to create a framework that enables a mission designer to generate a simulation that models the design problem and obtain a family of potential, near-optimal solutions that can be investigated more in detail.

GenETOC was developed in C# using the .NET framework with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) serving as the framework from which to create the graphical user interface (GUI).  GenETOC user inputs can be categorized into three major data components: definition of the problem (areas of interest, satellite decision parameters, and sensor configurations), definition of performance objectives, and specification of the genetic algorithm (GA) parameters. In the problem definition component, the user is prompted to define the areas of interest against which the performance metrics will be computed, define the sensor parameters and attach them to specific spacecraft, select which satellite orbital parameters will be added to the decision space of the GA, and specify the range of desired values for each optimization parameter. For performance objectives, the user is presented with a list of available coverage and revisit performance based calculation options from which two metrics are chosen to serve as the objective functions that the GA will use to evaluate solutions during the optimization process. Finally, the definition of the GA parameters provides user control over the number of generations (number of optimization iterations), the population size (number of candidate constellations created in each generation), and the adaptive mutation and crossover threshold values (control parameters for how frequently each process occurs during the optimization).

GenETOC has been extensively tested to verify the individual components of the optimization process. The GA has been tested against a suite of GA test problems to confirm convergence to the known two and three-dimensional Pareto fronts. The coverage and revisit performance metrics obtained in GenETOC are compared with STK desktop scenarios, confirming the constellations are being appropriately modeled within GenETOC simulations. A walkthrough of a simple, example problem is provided to illustrate the workings of GenETOC and to demonstrate the output available to the mission designer."

This manuscript applies Mixture Density Networks (MDN) that use the visible spectral bands available by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard Landsat-8 to estimate Chla. We utilize a database of co-located in situ radiometric and Chla measurements (N = 4,354), referred to as Type A data, to train and test an MDN model (MDN(A)). This algorithm’s performance, having been proven for other satellite missions, is further evaluated against other widely used machine learning models (e.g., support vector machines), as well as other domain-specific solutions (OC3), and shown to offer significant advancements in the field. Our performance assessment using a held-out test data set suggests that a 49% (median) accuracy with near-zero bias can be achieved via the MDN(A) model, offering improvements of 20 to 100% in retrievals with respect to other models. The sensitivity of the MDN(A) model and benchmarking methods to uncertainties from atmospheric correction (AC) methods, is further quantified through a semi-global matchup dataset (N = 3,337), referred to as Type B data. To tackle the increased uncertainties, alternative MDN models (MDN(B)) are developed through various features of the Type B data (e.g., Rayleigh-corrected reflectance spectra ρ(s)). Using held-out data, along with spatial and temporal analyses, we demonstrate that these alternative models show promise in enhancing the retrieval accuracy adversely influenced by the AC process. Results lend support for the adoption of MDN(B) models for regional and potentially global processing of OLI imagery, until a more robust AC method is developed.

Soil moisture is accordingly linked to T2M, and realistic soil moisture initialization has, in previous studies, been shown to improve the skill of subseasonal T2M forecasts. The relationship between soil moisture and evapotranspiration, however, is distinctly nonlinear, with ET tending to increase with soil moisture in drier conditions and to be insensitive to soil moisture variations in wetter conditions.  Here, through an extensive analysis of subseasonal forecasts produced with a state-of-the-art seasonal forecast system, this nonlinearity is shown to imprint itself on T2M forecast error in the conterminous United States in two unique ways:  (i) the T2M forecast bias (relative to independent observations) induced by a negative precipitation bias tends to be larger for dry initializations, and (ii) on average, the unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) tends to be larger for dry initializations.  Such findings can aid in the identification of forecasts of opportunity; taken a step further, they suggest a pathway for improving bias correction and uncertainty estimation in subseasonal T2M forecasts by conditioning each on initial soil moisture state."

The Noah-MP LSM is used to simulate water  and  energy  fluxes  and  states,  which  are  transformed  into  drought  categories  using percentiles over the continental U.S. from 1979 to 2017.  Leaf Area Index (LAI) observations are  assimilated  into  the  dynamic  vegetation  scheme  of  Noah-MP.

The results show that  LAI  assimilation  into  Noah-MP’s  dynamic  vegetation  scheme  improves  the  model’s ability  to  represent  drought,  particularly  over  cropland  areas.   LAI  assimilation  improves the  simulation  of  the  drought  category,  detection  of  drought  conditions,  and  reduces  the instances of drought false alarms. The assimilation of LAI in these locations not only corrects model  errors  in  the  simulation  of  vegetation,  but  also  can  help  to  represent  unmodeled physical processes such as irrigation towards improved simulation of agricultural drought."

We use satellite observations that discriminate stratocumulus (Sc) from shallow cumulus (Cu) clouds to separately evaluate their sensitivity to warming and constrain the tropical contribution to low-cloud feedback. We find an observationally inferred low-level feedback two times smaller than a previous estimate. Cu are insensitive to warming whereas GCMs exhibit a large positive cloud feedback in Cu regions. In contrast, Sc show sensitivity to warming and the tropical inversion layer strength, controlled by the tropical Pacific SST gradient. Models fail to reproduce the historical SST gradient trends and therefore changes in inversion strength, generating an overestimate of the positive Sc cloud feedback. Continued weak east-Pacific warming would therefore produce a weaker low-cloud feedback and imply a more moderate climate sensitivity (3.47  0.33 K) than many models predict."

The interpretation   of   the   chemistry   from   remote   sensing   instrumentation   from   orbiters   and landers/rovers has been strongly influenced by our knowledge of geochemical processes on Earth, the  Moon,  and  other  asteroidal,  rocky  bodies  [1].  The  composition,  and  thus  evolution,  of  the Martian crust has been resultant from SNC (shergottite –nakhlite –chassignite) meteorites, which are the igneous counterpart of rocks of Martian origin [2, 3, 4]. These meteorites are chemically similar to terrestrial basalts and cumulates, with the exception of higher concentrations of iron and other  volatile  elements  (i.e.,  phosphorous,  chlorine,  chalcophile)  [5].  From  Tuff  et  al.  [2],  most Martian meteorites have relatively young crystallization ages ranging from 1.4 billion years to 180 million  years  ago  [6].  These  are  considered  to  be  derived  from  young,  usually  lightly-cratered volcanic  regions,  such  as  the  Tharsis  volcanic  region  [6,  7].  Though  mainly  basaltic  in composition, surface rocks are richer in nickel and sulfur with lower manganese/iron ratios than Martian  meteorites  [2],  which  can  be  explained  by  the  differences  in  oxygen  fugacity  during melting of the sulfur-rich mantle [2, 8]. From this difference, Martian meteorites are tied to surface rocks through an early (3.7 billion years ago) oxidation of the uppermost mantle, producing the more recent volcanic rocks [2]. The variety of compositions from basaltic, olivine volcanic rocks through   pyroxene-cumulate   nakhlites   and   peridotite   chassignites,   enable   the   hypothetical reconstructions of the silicic evolution of Mars similar to techniques used on Earth [2, 5, 9]. In this chapter, we will explore the basic Martian composition of the crust and mantle in regards to volcanic regions, the crustal components of the North-South dichotomy, and more detail of the SNC meteorites in relation to the evolution of the mantle for volcanism."

Torch igniters inject propellants into a small prechamber where a spark igniter imparts the activation energy to initiate combustion. The flame stabilizes within the prechamber and exits into the main combustion chamber where it ignites the main flow directly or by mixing with a coaxial flow to create a secondary flame. The underlying phenomena that promote reliable ignition are multifaceted and required a broad scope of investigations. Initial efforts focused on spark discharges across an annular geometry. Gaseous propellent projects the electrical arc toward the prechamber, where the arc and the thermal energy is imparted to the surrounding fluid then meets with a combustible mixture. Discharges are parametrically examined against pressure, spark-gap size, and exciter types to emulate transient engine startup. The energy imparted to the flow, approximate velocity, and distance traveled by the exhaust plume are determined. Spark quenching (no energy deposition) and its effects on perceived versus actual measurements are shown. Results outline the prechamber target zone where a combustible mixture is necessary for ignition. Next, three-dimensional, time-accurate, and nonreacting computational fluid dynamics simulations assess effects of geometric and mass flow differences on the size, location, and composition of a combustible mixture. Fluid dynamic phenomena are elucidated. Correlations between nondimensional variables are found. Results are coupled with a conservation-law analysis to produce novel objective functions. Lastly, a full-scale, modular torch igniter is tested. Injector sizes, mixture ratios, and injector momentum ratios are systematically varied to map ignition probability and ignition delay. Results show the importance of local mixture ratios, provide injector momentum ratios guidelines, and demonstrate reliable ignition of core mixture ratios typically outside flammability limits. The deliverable of this project is not a torch igniter or derivative thereof. Instead, this dissertation produces novel objective-functions for igniter design. These equations are functions of variables that may be constrained by engine-level requirements, physics, and experimental results from this work. They provide a foundation for future igniter design and will minimize iterative processes from the design cycle for next-generation ignition hardware."

In  addition, excessive  noise  such  as  from  cosmic  ray  impacts,  prevalent  within  the  South  Atlantic  Anomaly,  can  also  degrade  satellite radiance  measurements. Saturation specifically pertains to  observations of  very bright surfaces  such as sun glint over open water or thick clouds. When saturation occurs, additional photoelectric charge generated at the saturated pixel may overflow to  pixels adjacent  to  a  saturated  area and  be  reflected  as  a  distorted  image  in  the  final  sensor  output.When these  effects cannot be corrected to an acceptable level for science quality retrievals, flagging of the affected pixels is indicated. Here, we introduce  a straightforward detection method that  is  based  on  the  correlation, r, between  the  observed  Earthshine  radiance and solar irradiance spectraover a 10 nm-spectral range; our Decorrelation Index (DI for brevity) is simply defined as DI=1-r. DI increases with anomalous additive effects or excessive noise in either radiances, the most likely cause indata from theOzone  Monitoring  Instrument (OMI),or  irradiances. DI is  relatively  straight-forward  to  use  and  interpret  and  can  be 20computed  for  different  wavelength  intervals.  We  developed  a  set  of  DIs  for  two  spectral  channelsof  the  OMI,  a hyperspectral pushbroom  imaging  spectrometer.  For  each  OMI spatial measurement,  we  define  14  wavelength-dependent DIs  within  the  OMI  visible  channel  (350-498  nm)  and  6  DIs  in  its  ultraviolet  2  (UV2)  channel  (310-370  nm).  As  defined, DIs  reflect  a  continuous  range  of  deviations  of  observed  spectra  from  the  reference  irradiance  spectrum  that are complementary   to   the   binary   Saturation   Possibility   Warning   (SPW)   flags   currently   provided   for   each   individual spectral/spatial pixel in the OMI radiance data set. Smaller values of DI are also caused by a number of geophysical factors; this allows one to obtain interesting physical results on the global distribution of spectral variations."

Although the boundary layer on thesuction side and pressure side of the blades is initially laminar due to favorable pressure gradient, the laminar flow can transition to turbulent flow past a separation zoneon the suction sideor by natural or by-pass transition. This process determinesthe total-pressure lossesin the wake. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a reliable prediction tool to accurately capture the transition mechanism in blade rows operated under the conditions of low Reynolds number andat a variety offree stream turbulence conditions. Our numerical studies reveal that the location of separationis rather insensitive to the level of Tu, however the effect ofincreasingTu seems to be in reducing the size and ultimately suppressing the separation bubble. In addition, we performedspectral analysis to identify the peak frequencies in the region where the separation bubble is formed, which provides valuable insights into the transition/separation mechanism."

demonstrate overall throughput capability, validate service life models, quantify wear rates as a function
of time and operating condition, and identify any unknown life-limiting mechanisms. The test was
voluntarily terminated in February 2014 after demonstrating 51,184 h of high-voltage operation, 918 kg
of propellant throughput, and 35.5 MN-s of total impulse. The post-test inspection of the thruster
hardware began shortly afterwards with a combination of non-destructive and destructive analysis
techniques, and is presently nearing completion. This paper presents relevant results of the post-test
inspection for both discharge and neutralizer cathodes. Discharge keeper erosion was found to be
significantly reduced from what was observed in the NEXT 2 kh wear test and NSTAR Extended Life
Test, providing adequate protection of vital cathode components throughout the test with ample lifetime
remaining. The area of the discharge cathode orifice plate that was exposed by the keeper orifice
exhibited net erosion, leading to cathode plate material building up in the cathode-keeper gap and causing
a thermally-induced electrical short observed during the test. Significant erosion of the neutralizer cathode
orifice was also found and is believed to be the root cause of an observed loss in flow margin. Deposition
within the neutralizer keeper orifice as well as on the downstream surface was thicker than expected,
potentially resulting in a facility-induced impact on the measured flow margin from plume mode.
Neutralizer keeper wall erosion on the beam side was found to be significantly lower compared to the
NEXT 2 kh wear test, likely due to the reduction in beam extraction diameter of the ion optics that
resulted in decreased ion impingement. Results from the post-test inspection have led to some minor
thruster design improvements."

Testing was voluntarily terminated in February 2014, with the thruster accumulating 51,184 hours of operation, processing 918 kg of xenon propellant, and delivering 35.5 MN-s of total impulse. The post-test inspection objectives for the ion optics were derived from the original NEXT LDT test objectives, such as service life model validation, and expanded to encompass other goals that included verification of in situ measurements, test issue root causes, and past design changes. The ion optics cold grid gap had decreased only by an average of 7% of pretest center grid gap, so efforts to stabilize NEXT grid gap were largely successful. The upstream screen grid surface exhibited a chamfered erosion pattern. Screen grid thicknesses were ≥ 86% of the estimated pretest thickness, indicating that the screen grid has substantial service life remaining. Deposition was found on the screen aperture walls and downstream surfaces that was primarily composed of grid material and back-sputtered carbon, and this deposition likely caused the minor decreases in screen grid ion transparency during the test. Groove depths had eroded through up to 35% of the accelerator grid thickness. Minimum accelerator aperture diameters increased only by about 5-7% of the pretest values and downstream surface diameters increased by about 24-33% of the pretest diameters. These results suggest that increasing the accelerator aperture diameters, improving manufacturing tolerances, and masking down the perforated diameter to 36 cm were successful in reducing the degree of accelerator aperture erosion at larger radii."

We sampled emissions from H2O, HCN, C2H2, NH3,C2H6, and CH3OH on UT 2018 December 21 using two instrumental settings that spanned the 2.9–3.6μm spectral region. We also obtained a sensitive 3σupper limit for H2CO and for the rarely studied molecule HC3N. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and mixing ratios(relative to H2O as well as to C2H6). We place our results in context by comparing them with other comets observed at near-IR wavelengths. We also compare our results with those obtained using the NIRSPEC-2 spectrograph on Keck II on UT December 17 and 18 and with results obtained from iSHELL on other dates during the same apparition. Within1–2σ uncertainty, production rates obtained for all molecules in this work were consistent with those obtained using NIRSPEC-2 except H2O, indicating low-level variability on a timescale of days. Mixing ratios with respect to H2O in 46P/Wirtanen were consistent with corresponding values from NIRSPEC-2 within the uncertainty with the exception of CH3OH, which yielded a higher ratio on December 21. Our measurements afforded a high temporal resolution that spanned∼2/3 of the rotational period of 46P/Wirtanen, enabling us to test short-term variability in the production rates of H2O and HCN due to rotational effects. Both H2O and HCN production rates showed similar temporal variability, resulting in nearly constant HCN/H2O"

Here, we analyzed the relationships between different climate parameters and annually resolved tree-ring δ(18)O records (δ(18)O(TR)) from white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench]Voss) trees located near Tungsten (Northwest Territories, Canada) and used the NASA GISS ModelE2 isotopically-equipped general circulation model (GCM) to better interpret the observed relationships. We found that the δ(18)O(TR) series were primarily related to temperature variations in spring and summer, likely through temperature effects on the precipitation δ(18)O in spring, and evaporative enrichment at leaf level in summer. The GCM simulations showed significant positive relationships between modelled precipitation δ(18)O over the study region and surface temperature and geopotential height over northwestern North America, but of stronger magnitudes during fall-winter than during spring–summer. The modelled precipitation δ(18)O was only significantly associated with moisture transport during the fall-winter season. The δ(18)O(TR) showed similar correlation patterns to modelled precipitation δ(18)O only during spring–summer when water matters more for trees, with significant positive correlations with surface temperature and geopotential height, but no correlations with moisture transport. Overall, the δ(18)O(TR) records for northwestern Canada reflect the same significant large-scale climate patterns as precipitation δ(18)O for spring–summer, and therefore have potential for reconstructing past atmospheric dynamics in addition to temperature variability in the region."

Recent advances in aviation technology such as small highly-automated vehicles, electric aircraft, and automated air traffic are enabling business opportunities in these markets. Advanced Air Mobility, or AAM, refers to a community effort to overcome the gaps in operational rules, safety analysis, and overall  acceptance, so that these new operations will be possible.  For full details, please see: https://www.nasa.gov/aam

As we think about how we can safely introduce these new operations, fundamental questions about how the structure of Safety Management Systems can be applied to AAM, and how that structure can be used to help us overcome the necessary technical and societal obstacles arise. Two of these questions are:
•	How do we tailor the requirements and desired level of monitoring and assessment to achieve safety given the breadth of possible operations and the associated risk of those operations?
•	How do we aid innovation by rapidly evaluating the safety of novel operations without losing associated rigor?

We assume that a Safety Management System that enables these future systems will incorporate knowledge of the acceptable level of risk, and will utilize data science to automate the core monitor, assess and mitigate functions that will allow us to respond to risks and hazards in time to prevent safety incidents. In 2018, the National Academies proposed an In-Time Aviation Safety Management System (IASMS) that would advance these goals.  (https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24962/in-time-aviation-safety-management-challenges-and-research-for-an) The National Academies made a clear distinction between in-time systems, in which hazards could be identified and risks mitigated in time to prevent incidents, and real-time systems, since many hazards and risks do not need real-time data and analysis to detect and mitigate."

Volcano clusters can develop over millions of years, one volcano at a time, and can be used to infer unobserved geologic phenomena, including subsurface stresses and cracks during eruption periods. The Tharsis Volcanic Province covers approximately one quarter of the Martian surface and hosts a large concentration of small volcanoes that formed from distributed volcanism. We present a catalog of 1106 small volcanic vents identified within Tharsis Volcanic Province. This catalog includes morphologic measurements for each cataloged vent. Vent lengths range from 71 m to 51 km, widths range from 40 m to 3.1 km, and 90% of vents have lengths at least 1.5 times their widths. Additionally, 90% of edifices associated with vents have topographic prominences <100 m. Vents are found throughout Tharsis, though they generally form clusters near large volcanoes or among large graben sets. Older regions with volcanic eruption ages of >1 Ga are found at the Tharsis periphery in the Tempe-Mareotis region and Syria Planum. Vents in the Tharsis interior have reported ages <500 Ma. Regional trends in vent orientation and intervent alignment are dependent on nearby central volcanoes and fossae. We use these findings to hypothesize that within the most recent 500 Ma, magma was present under and to the east of the Tharsis Montes and that some of this magma erupted and built hundreds of small volcanoes in this region."

We analyzed a total of 421 events and determined the spectrum in rigidity with an inverse power-law fit. As a result, the mean spectral index was identified to be 〈γF〉 = 0.46 ± 0.02. The majority (∼66%) of the FDs have γF within the range 0.3–0.7. The remaining one-third of the events (∼33%) have either (very) soft or hard FD spectra, with the latter being more common than the former. Significant variations of γF occur within almost every FD event. During the initial FD decay phase the spectrum becomes gradually harder, in contrast to the recovery phase, when it becomes softer. Additionally, low energies (rigidities) seem to be better suited for studying the fine structure of interplanetary disturbances (primarily interplanetary coronal mass ejections) that lead to FDs. In particular, FDs recorded by the
EPHIN instrument on SOHO better capture a two-step structure than FDs observed by NMs. Finally, the ejecta of an ICME, especially when identified as a magnetic cloud, often leads to abrupt changes in the slope of γF."

Both absorption and emission components showed strong variations. The variation of the absorption component as the O5 star was occulted by the wind-collision region (WCR) sets a tight constraint on its geometry. While the sightline to the O5 star traversed the WCR, the strength and breadth of the absorption component varied significantly on time-scales of days. An emission sub-peak was observed on all our profiles. The variation of its radial velocity with orbital phase was shown to be consistent with formation in the WCR as it swung round the stars in their orbit. Modelling the profile gave a measure of the extent of the sub-peak forming region. In the phase range 0.93–0.99, the flux in the sub-peak increased steadily, approximately inversely proportionally to the stellar separation, indicating that the shocked gas in the WCR where the line was formed was adiabatic. After periastron, the sub-peak flux was anomalously strong and varied rapidly, suggesting formation in clumps down-stream in the WCR. For most of the time, its flux exceeded the 2–10-keV X-ray emission, showing it to be a significant coolant of the shocked wind."

For this to be accomplished, the methodology starts by designing a feedback controller based on a loop shaping technique. The design is then improved by employing a root locus control design approach. Finally, the response of the feedback system is further improved by augmenting the control design using model reference control. The design approach also takes into consideration the speed of the process actuator for a fast response and for high disturbance rejection. Results from two control design examples covered in the paper show that this control approach can tolerate plant proportional gain uncertainty of approximately  ±  two orders of magnitude with  relatively large variations in plant frequencies and damping."

Positive ions produced from the lunar surface and exosphere are inferred to have densities that are.106– 107m−3near the surface and smaller at higher altitudes, yet electron densities derived from radio occultation measurements occasionally exceed these values by orders of magnitude. For example, about 4% of the single-spacecraft radio occultation measurements from Kaguya/SELENE were consistent with peak electron densities of∼3×108m−3. Space plasmas should be neutral on macroscopic scales, so this represents a substantial discrepancy. Additional observations of electron densities in the lunar ionosphere are critical to resolving this long standing paradox. Here we theoretically assess whether radio occultation observations using two-way coherent S-band radio signals from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft could provide useful measurements of electron densities in the lunar ionosphere. We predict the uncertainty in a single LRO radio occultation measurement of electron density to be∼3×108m−3, comparable to occasional observations by Kaguya/SELENE of a dense lunar ionosphere. Thus an individual profile from LRO is unlikely to reliably detect the lunar ionosphere; however, averages of multiple (∼10) LRO profiles acquired under similar geophysical and viewing conditions should be able to make reliable detections. An observing rate of six ingress occultations per day (∼2000 per year) could be achieved with mini-mal impact on current LRO operations. This rate compares favorably with the 378observations reported from the single-spacecraft experiment on Kaguya/SELENE between November 2007 and June 2009. The large number of observations possible for LRO would be sufficient to permit wide-ranging investigations of spatial and temporal variations in the poorly understood lunar ionosphere. These findings strengthen efforts to conduct such observations with LRO."

We reviewed the literature on AI and ML bias with a focus on social implications and found that bias in AI and ML can potentially have harmful social impacts on individuals and/or groups of people. By affecting people differently according to characteristics such as race, gender, or sexual orientation, AI and ML systems may lead to harm by exacerbating social inequities. We recount examples of issues that have occurred in systems that use technology that might be used at NASA and elsewhere so that similar issues might be identified and mitigated in future systems. We also provide interested parties with a gateway into existing work on social bias in AI and ML systems."

This is especially true with chondritic-porous interplanetary dust particles, which are considered to have a cometary origin and are among some of the most primitive and least processed materials available for study. Another phenomenon which occurs under the same carburizing conditions as the Fischer–Tropsch reaction is called metal dusting and could be a possible pathway to forming some of the carbonaceous material found in primitive bodies. Metal dusting is a catastrophic corrosion of metal under these carburizing conditions that results in a porous mixture of carbonaceous material, metal, and metal carbides. In the case of pure iron, type I metal dusting results in the formation of a metastable iron carbide, typically cementite, Fe3C. While metal dusting has been studied industrially for over 50 years, it does not appear to have been applied to the formation of carbonaceous material in astrophysical settings. In this work, the general mechanism of metal dusting on iron is described and a thermodynamic analysis of the dusting phenomena applied to solar nebula conditions. Rate measurements are made with pure iron samples over the temperature range from 400°C to 950°C. In addition, the products from experimental runs at 500°C and 600°C are studied by transmission electron microscopy. Results show that iron carbide particles are formed with carbonaceous material consisting of poorly graphitized carbon."

We detected eleven flares from GT Mus in eight years of observations with MAXI (Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image)from 2009 August to 2017 August.  The detected flare peak luminosities were 1–4×1033erg s−1in the2.0–20.0 keV band for its distance of 109.6 pc.  The durations of the flares ranged from 1–4 days.  The flare energies are calculated to be 1–8×1038erg, which are at the upper end of the observed stellar flare.  We carried out X-ray follow-up observations for one of the eleven flares with NICER (Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer) on 2017 July 18 and found that the flare cooled quasi-statically. On the basis of a quasi-static cooling model, the flare loop length is derived to be 4×1012cm (or60R).  The electron density is derived to be1×1010cm−3, which is consistent with the typical value of solar and stellar flares (1010−11cm−3)."

Results show that multi-sensor DA improves SWE estimates by reducing the RMSE by 14.1% relative to a model-only simulation. Multi-sensor assimilation also yields the smallest TWS RMSE (reduced by 13.0% relative to a model-only simulation). However, multi-sensor DA does not always yield complementary updates, and can sometimes lead to conflicting changes to SWE, where the assimilation of synthetic ∆T(b) generates positive SWE increments while the assimilation of synthetic TWS removes SWE, which can ultimately degrade the posterior SWE estimates. This synthetic experiment provides useful insight for future DA experiments using real-world AMSR-E/AMSR-2 ∆T(b) observations and GRACE/GRACE-FO TWS retrievals to better characterize terrestrial freshwater storage across regional scales."

By exploiting large sets of measurements from many ship campaigns in conjunction with reanalysis products, this study characterizes the sensitivity of the SRF and skin Sea‐Surface Temperature (SSTskin) to the Saharan dust aerosols using models of the atmospheric radiative transfer and thermal skin effect. Saharan dust outbreaks can decrease the surface shortwave radiation up to 190 W/sq.m, and an analysis of the corresponding SST(skin) changes using a thermal skin model suggests dust‐induced cooling effects as large as −0.24 K during daytime and a warming effect of up of 0.06 K during daytime and nighttime respectively. Greater physical insight into the radiative transfer through an aerosol‐burdened atmosphere will substantially improve the predictive capabilities of weather and climate studies on a regional basis."

Forecast-based early action (FbA) is an approach to shift disaster response toward anticipation to mitigate impacts to at-risk communities; however, timely and accurate information is needed in the development of data-based triggers and thresholds for action. Therefore, this paper considers the readiness of a wide range of EO for flood monitoring and forecasting in the design, operations, and evaluation phases of FbA. The most significant opportunities for EO to inform FbA efforts lie in the design and evaluation phases, as EO can aid in the development of impact-based triggers. The EO products most readily applicable include precipitation, streamflow estimates, and exposure mapping, and those requiring the greatest amount of further research include vulnerability and impact assessments. This paper identifies collaboration opportunities for the EO and humanitarian communities to create tailored products, such as overlays combining flood extents with exposure maps. Such collaboration opportunities can be fostered by open data sharing, data verification efforts, and incentives for supporting boundary organizations capable of enabling the use of EO for FbA."

Historically, and from a simplistic abstract perspective, the common approach has been to adopt the, so-called, moat model whereby a physical network perimeter (or interconnected perimeters) is defined to encapsulate resources behind a boundary protected by a firewall. Users are provisioned access through a virtual private network (VPN) and may be further constrained to resources through specific firewall allow and disallow rulesets. Virtual Private Networks and firewall rulesets lead to common problems, particularly at scale and, as a result, perimeter-less architectures provided over the public internet are increasingly becoming prevalent, particularly with its more popular implementation, the Zero Trust Architecture. We present a proposed implementation of the Zero Trust Architecture with a particular concrete example utilizing a de-perimeterized network that requires authentication and authorization for each action between nodes and does not operate within an implicit trust boundary.  It should be noted that this paper is not an attempt at providing comprehensive resolutions for the specific problem space with respect to perimeter based security and is more directed at providing information with regard to our proposed implementation of a Zero Trust Architecture for the Flight Operations Directorate. We direct the reader to our Introduction and Background section for more details on specific documentation and where it can be located as it relates to de-perimeterization and Zero Trust."

High quality tantalum capacitors are likely the only type of components where soldering simulation is the first step during screening. Nevertheless, post-soldering failures of tantalum capacitors do happen and require additional analysis. Popcorning is a well-known effect in plastic encapsulated microcircuits (PEM) and it occurs also in chip tantalum capacitors. The sensitivity of parts to the presence of moisture during soldering is characterized by the moisture sensitivity level (MSL); however, contrary to PEMs, there is no standard procedure for establishing MSL for tantalum capacitors, and standard J-STD-020 is applicable partially only. In this work, the effect of absorbed moisture on soldering related degradation and failures in tantalum capacitors have been studied using 22 types of polymer and 11 types of MnO2 cathodes tantalum capacitors including single and multianode parts. The amount of moisture released during soldering has been estimated by measurements of mass and capacitance variations. Results show that moisture uptake in similar parts is approximately two times greater in polymer than in MnO2 capacitors. Cracking of the case and degradation of parameters can occur in both types of parts, but MnO2 capacitors are much more susceptible to catastrophic short circuit failures and their ignition is possible during the first power-on cycle. This type of failure in MnO2 capacitors is lot-related, can occur even at derated voltages and relatively low levels of moisture sorption corresponding to room conditions. Baking before soldering is an effective measure to prevent failures even in lots susceptible to popcorning damage. Recommendations for testing to establish MSL and for baking to reduce the probability of failures are suggested."

(NIR) around 1000 nanometer (nm) wavelengths. The NIR emissivity of Venus’s surface can constrain
rock types and their weathering state; emissivities can be measured directly or calculated from reflectances. We
measured the reflectances of igneous and sedimentary rocks at Venus’s surface temperature, 400 °C–500 °C at 850
and 950 nm; samples were heated in a box furnace in air, illuminated by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and imaged
with a modified charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Reflectances were also measured at 25 °C from 350 to
1400 nm. Rock reflectances at 850 and 950 nm and 400 °C–500 °C are nearly identical to those at 25 °C, except for
the effects of nanophase hematite forming on some surfaces. Fresh basalts have reflectances (high and low
temperatures) near 7.5%; a leucogranite similarly has reflectances near 50%. Pigmentary hematite has nearly
identical reflectances at high- and low-temperature at these wavelengths. Pigmentary hematite appears dark brown
400 °C–500 °C because its absorption edge has shifted to beyond the limit of human vision. These rock
reflectances imply that basalts should have emissivities near 0.9, and granite (and similar felsic rocks) should have
lower emissivities ∼0.5. Thus, basalt and felsic rock should be easily distinguished in NIR emissivity
measurements of Venus’s surface, such as are baselined in recent Venus mission proposals. Other sedimentary
rocks should have even lower emissivities: quartz sand at around ∼0.3, and anhydrite as low as 0.1."

By subjecting an electrostatically-levitated liquid metal droplet to a continuous, oscillatory, electric field, at a frequency nearing that of the droplet’s first principal mode of oscillation (known as mode 2), the method was previously shown to determine surface tension of materials that would be particularly difficult to process by other means, e.g.  liquid metals and alloys.  It also offers distinct advantages in future work involving high viscosity samples because of the continuous forcing approach.  This work presents 1) a benchmarking experimental method to measure surface tension by excitation of the second principal mode of oscillation (known as mode 3) in a levitated liquid droplet and 2) a more rigorous quantification of droplet excitation using a projection method.  Surface tension measurements compare favorably to literature values for Zirconium,  Inconel 625,  and Rhodium,  using both modes 2 and 3.  Thus, this new method serves as a credible, self-consistent benchmarking technique for the measurement of surface tension"

Zonal winds at most latitudes remain close to values obtained by the Cassini mission with a slight increase of winds in the equatorial zone.

Using free energy sampling techniques we reveal the interfacial speciation of divalent cations in ether-based electrolytes and mechanisms for their delivery to an inert graphene electrode interface. Surprisingly, we find that anion solvophobicity drives a high population of anion-containing species to the interface that facilitate the delivery of divalent cations, even to negatively charged electrodes. Our simulations indicate that cation desolvation is greatly facilitated by cation-anion coupling.  We propose anion solvophobicity as a molecular-level descriptor for rational design of electrolytes with increased efficiency for electrochemical processes limited by multivalent cation desolvation."

A mechanism of self-healing in MnO2 capacitors is associated with oxygen reduction in the cathode layer and isolation of the breakdown site with high-resistive Mn2O3/Mn3O4 compositions. Although this mechanism is commonly accepted, details of self-healing have not been analyzed sufficiently yet, and the effects of scintillations on behavior of the parts has not been fully understood. There is a lack of data on the self-healing efficiency in different lots of capacitors. Even less is known about self-healing in polymer tantalum capacitors. In this work, different types of polymer and MnO2 capacitors have been tested for scintillation breakdown using a constant current stress (CCS) technique modified to allow detection of the amplitudes and durations of current spikes during breakdown. Characteristics of the parts and in particular leakage currents were measured to assess the efficiency of self-healing and improve screening processes for tantalum capacitors. Damaged sites were localized using infrared camera and their appearance analyzed after deprocessing and crosssectioning. Thermal effects during scintillations have been modeled, self-healing processes in polymer and MnO2 cathode capacitors discussed, and mechanisms of breakdown based on the growth of conductive filaments in the dielectric suggested."

Residual stresses arising from the phase change of constituents are evaluated in this paper and it is shown that they do influence composite strength and need to be properly accounted for.  Additionally, the microstructures (location of fiber centers, coating thickness etc.) of advanced CMCs are usually disordered (or random) and fiber diameter and strength typically have a distribution.  They rarely resemble the ordered fiber packing (square, rectangular, or hexagonal) that is generally assumed in micromechanics-based models with periodic boundary conditions for computational expediency. These issues raise the question of how should one model such systems effectively?  Can an ordered hexagonal packed repeating unit cell (RUC) accurately represent the random microstructure behavior? How many fibers need to be included to enable accurate representation? Clearly, the number of fibers within an RUC must be limited to insure a balance between accuracy and efficiency.  NASA’s in-house micromechanics-based code MAC/GMC provides a framework to analyze such RUCs for the overall composite behavior and the FEAMAC computer code provides linkage of MAC/GMC to the commercial FEA code, ABAQUS.  The appropriate level of discretization of the RUC as well as the analysis method employed, i.e., Generalized Method of Cells (GMC) or High Fidelity Generalized Method of Cells (HFGMC), is investigated in this paper in the context of a unidirectional as well as a cross-ply laminated CMC.  Results including effective composite properties, proportional limit stress (an important design parameter) and fatigue are shown utilizing both GMC as well as HFGMC. Finally, a few multiscale analyses are performed on smooth bar test coupons as well as test coupons with features such as open-hole and double notches using FEAMAC.  Best practices and guidance are provided to take these phenomena into account and keep a proper balance between fidelity (accuracy) and efficiency.  Following these guidelines can account for important physics of the problem and provide significant advantages when performing large multiscale composite structural analyses."

Using data collected with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer and XMM-Newton, we investigated the pulsar evolution over a time span of four years. We obtained a unique phase-coherent timing solution for the stellar spin, finding the source to be spinning up at a rate of (3.77 ± 0.09) × 10−15 Hz s−1. We further find that the 0.4–6 keV pulse fraction varies gradually between 0.5% and 2.5% following a sinusoidal oscillation with a 1210 ± 40 day period. Finally, we supplemented this analysis with an archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observation and obtained a phase-coherent model for the binary orbit spanning 12 yr, yielding an orbital period-derivative measurement of (8.4 ± 2.0) × 10−12 s s−1. This large orbital period derivative is inconsistent with a binary evolution that is dominated by gravitational wave emission and is suggestive of highly non-conservative mass transfer in the binary system."

We solve the general dispersion relation to understand the role of compressive viscosity and thermal conductivity in the damping of slow waves in coronal loops with and without heating–cooling imbalance. We have analyzed the wave damping for the range of loop length L=50--500 Mm, temperature T=5--30 MK, and density ρ=10^(−11)--10^(−9) kg/cu.m. It was found that the inclusion of compressive viscosity along with thermal conductivity significantly enhances the damping of the fundamental mode oscillations in shorter (e.g. L=50 Mm) and super-hot (T>10 MK) loops. However, the role of viscosity in the damping is insignificant in longer (e.g. L=500 Mm) and hot loops (T≤10 MK) where, instead, thermal conductivity along with the presence of heating–cooling imbalance plays a dominant role. For shorter loops at a super-hot regime of temperature, the increment in the loop density substantially enhances the damping of the fundamental modes due to thermal conductivity when viscosity is absent, however, when the compressive viscosity is added the increase in density substantially weakens the damping. Thermal conductivity alone is found to play a dominant role in longer loops at lower temperatures (T≤10 MK), while compressive viscosity dominates the damping at super-hot temperatures (T>10 MK) in shorter loops. The predicted scaling law between damping time (τ) and wave period (P) is found to better match the observed SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation) oscillations when the heating–cooling imbalance is taken into account in addition to thermal conductivity and compressive viscosity for the damping of the fundamental slow mode oscillations."

The model was applied to two SiCf/SiC minicomposite systems that were fabricated by Rolls-Royce and the University of Connecticut.  The analysis approach accounts in an average sense for the fact that the cracks in an actual minicomposite often have an irregular geometry.  The effects of local variations in the fiber volume ratio on the composite response was also investigated.  Parametric studies were performed to investigate the effect of the interfacial shear stress, global fiber volume fraction and percentage of the composite that remains uncracked on the proportional limit stress and the composite secondary modulus.  This work will facilitate an increased understanding of the key material mechanisms that take place during fast fracture loading."

The NHRO, (Perilune = 3,200 km; Apolune = 70,000 km) will be the intended orbit for the NASA’s Artemis Gateway lunar orbital platform. The CAPSTONE mission will validate simulations and confirm operational planning for Gateway while also validating performance of navigation and station-keeping requirements for the Power and Propulsion Element. Thus, this mission will provide operational experience to NASA, commercial, and international missions for operations in a demanding orbital regime. 

The baseline for CAPSTONE is to fly a 12U cubesat developed, integrated, and tested by Tyvak Nanosatellite Systems carrying a payload communications system capable of cross-link ranging with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), a dedicated payload flight computer for software demonstration, and a camera. The launch, coordinated by NASA Launch Services Program, will be provided by a Rocket Lab launch vehicle utilizing their new Proton upper stage to deploy the CAPSTONE spacecraft into the lunar orbit. The CAPSTONE mission is targeting a launch no earlier than September 23, 2021. Upon launch, the spacecraft will traverse a highly efficient transfer taking approximately three months to enter a primary demonstration phase in an NRHO for six months followed by a twelve month technology enhancement operations phase.

The CAPSTONE Project is lead by Advanced Space, LLC of Boulder Colorado. Spacecraft development and mission operations will be conducted by Tyvak Nanosatellite Systems of Irvine, California. Noted objectives for the CAPSTONE mission will be to demonstrate the accessibility of NHROs, validate key operational concepts in the NHRO environment, lay a foundation for commercial support of future lunar operations and accelerate the availability of peer-to-peer navigation capabilities provided by the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS).

The CAPSTONE mission is funded through NASA's Small Spacecraft Technology Program (SSTP), which is one of several programs in NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate. SSTP is chartered to develop and demonstrate technologies to enhance and expand the capabilities of small spacecraft with a particular focus on enabling new mission architectures through the use of small spacecraft, expanding the reach of small spacecraft to new destinations, and augmenting future missions with supporting small spacecraft. The launch for the CAPSTONE Mission is provided by Human Exploration & Operations Missions Directorate Advanced Exploration Systems Division. Coordination and Acquisition of the Launch is managed by NASA’s Launch Services Program. The CAPSTONE Mission and project status will be presented."

For this, ratios of extinction coefficients obtained from SAGE III/ISS (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the International Space Station) solar occultation measurements at 449, 756 and 1544 nm were used to retrieve the mode width and median radius of a size distribution assumed to be monomodal lognormal. The estimated errors at the peak of the stratospheric aerosol layer, on average, lie between 20% and 25% for the median radius and 5% and 7% for the mode width.  The results are consistent in magnitude with other retrieval results from the literature, but a robust comparison is difficult, mainly because of differences in temporal and spatial coverage. Other quantities like number density and effective radius were also calculated. A major advantage of the described method over other retrieval techniques is that both the median radius and the mode width can be retrieved simultaneously, without having to assume one of them. This is possible due to the broad wavelength spectrum covered by the SAGE III/ISS measurements. Also, the presented method – being based on the analysis of three wavelengths – allows
unique solutions for the retrieval of PSD parameters for almost all of the observed extinction spectra, which is not the case when using only two spectral channels. In addition, the extinction coefficients from SAGE III/ISS solar occultation measurements, on which the retrieval is based, are calculated without a priori assumptions about the PSD. For those reasons, the data produced with the presented retrieval technique may be a valuable contribution for a better understanding of the variability of stratospheric aerosol size distributions, e.g. after volcanic eruptions. While this study focuses on describing the retrieval method, and a future study will discuss the PSD parameter data set produced in depth, some exemplary results for background conditions in June 2017 are shown."

While the behavior of these models is well understood and they allow for a comparison of different sources and studying source behavior, the extent to which the underlying physics can be derived from the model parameters is very limited. During recent years, several physically motivated spectral models have been developed to overcome these limitations. Their application, however, is generally computationally much more expensive and they require a high number of parameters which are difficult to constrain. In particular, Becker & Wolff(2007) presented an analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation inside the accretion column assuming a velocity profile that is linear in the optical depth. An implementation of this model that is both fast and accurate enough to be fitted to observed spectra is available in XSPEC. The main difficulty of this implementation is that some solutions violate energy conservation and therefore have to be rejected by the user. We propose a novel fitting strategy that ensures energy conservation during theχ2-minimization which simplifies the application of the model considerably. We demonstrate this approach as well as a study of possible parameter degeneracies with a comprehensive Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the complete parameter space for a combined NuSTAR and Swift/XRT dataset of Cen X-3.The derived accretion-flow structure features a small column radius of∼63 m and a spectrum dominated by bulk-Comptonization of bremsstrahlung seed photons, in agreement with previous studies."

Here we present the results of a long-term monitoring campaign of ULXP NGC 7793 P13, focusing on the pulse period evolution and the determination of the orbital ephemeris. Over our four year monitoring campaign with Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR, we measure a continuous spin-up with an average value of ̇P≈−3.8×10−11s s−1. We find that the strength of the spin-up is independent of the observed X-ray flux, indicating that despite a drop in observed flux in 2019, accretion onto the source has continued at largely similar rates. The source entered an apparent off-state in early 2020, which might have resulted in a change of the accretion geometry as no pulsations were found in observations in July/August 2020.We use the long-term monitoring to update the orbital ephemeris, as well as the periodicities seen in both the observed optical/UV and X-ray fluxes. We find that the optical/UV period is very stable over the years, with PUV=63.75+0.17−0.12d. The best-fit orbital period determined from our X-ray timing results is 64.86±0.19 d, almost a day longer than previously implied, and the X-ray flux period is65.21±0.15 d, slightly shorter than measured previously. The physical origin of these different flux periods is currently unknown. We study the hardness ratio of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data between 2013–2020 to search for indications of spectral changes. We find that the hardness ratios at high energies are very stable and not directly correlated with the observed flux. At lower energies we observe a small hardening with increased flux, which might indicate increased obscuration through outflows at higher luminosities. Comparing the changes in flux with the observed pulsed fraction, we find that the pulsed fraction is significantly higher at low fluxes. This seems to imply that the accretion geometry already changed before the source entered the deep off-state. We discuss possible scenarios to explain this behavior, which is likely driven by a precessing accretion disk."

This difficulty stems from the highly model-dependent nature of LSM SM estimates and differences in the vertical support of discretized SM values. As a result, operational SM estimates generated by one LSM (or LDAS) cannot generally be directly applied to a hydrologic monitoring or forecast system designed around a second LSM. This lack of transferability is particularly problematic for LDAS applications, where the time, expertise, and computational resources required to generate an operational LDAS analysis cannot be practically duplicated for every LSM-specific application. Here, we develop a set of simple regression tools for translating SM estimates between LSMs and multiple LDAS analyses. Results demonstrate that simple multivariate linear regression - utilizing independent variables based on multi-layer and temporally lagged SM estimates - can significantly improve upon baseline transformation approaches using direct percentile matching. The proposed regression approaches are effective for both the LSM-to-LSM and LDAS-to-LDAS transformation of multi-layer SM percentiles. Application of this approach will expand the utility of existing, high-quality (but LSM-specific) operational sources of SM information like the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-4 Soil Moisture product."

Survey participants will rate their perception of the low-booms from supersonic X-59 flyovers. Several noise metrics are proposed to quantify the noise dose: A-, B-, D-, and E-weighted Sound Exposure Level, Stevens Perceived Level, and Indoor Sonic Boom Annoyance Predictor. Sparse measurements across the survey area will be used to estimate community noise exposure. The level of these low-booms may be comparable to the ambient noise level in some locations, leading to uncertainty in noise exposure estimations. This uncertainty may necessitate increased reliance on sonic boom propagation predictions for exposure estimation. Low-boom signal to ambient noise ratio is one way to quantify uncertainty in measured sonic boom levels. An empirical relationship between A-weighted ambient level and sonic boom metric levels is used in conjunction with the National Park Service’s L50 SPL map to estimate ambient noise levels expressed in terms of sonic boom noise metrics across the USA. These estimates of ambient levels will aid in X-59 community test planning and execution. The signal-to-noise ratio for the undertrack X-59 sonic boom is also estimated, and an example application of these data is presented for comparing potential noise monitor sites prior to a community noise test."

The downstream magnetic oscillations of oblique collisionless shocks were detected by Wind with 10.9 samples/s and DSCOVR spacecraft with high temporal resolution of 50 samples/s. The density oscillations associated with the shocks are also evident in proton and α particle density by Wind (with much lower temporal resolution). Recently, we have investigated low Mach number low-β oblique shock oscillations using satellite data and 2.5D hybrid modeling with electrons modeled as fluid and ions modeled as particles and found that α particles—an important component of heliospheric plasma—may affect considerably the downstream oscillations and the shock structure. The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of α particles on high Mach number heliospheric shocks dynamics, oscillations, nonstationarity, and shock-front rippling. We extend the study to high Mach number shocks (M > 3), investigate several α particle typical densities, and compare the results for the various shock parameters. We model the effects of α particles on the shock ramp, wake, and downstream oscillation structure and the kinetic properties of proton and α particle velocity distributions at various locations downstream of the shocks. Using the 2.5D hybrid model we found that the modeled high Mach number quasi-perpendicular shock magnetic and density structures are significantly affected by α particles with typical solar wind relative abundances, suggesting that the observed high Mach number shocks are similarly affected by α particles."

A basic model for titanium diffusion in NASA HR-1 was developed to project titanium segregation as a function of homogenization temperature, time, and grain size.

In this paper, we present comprehensive NICER, NuSTAR, Chandra, Swift, and MAXI observations of AT2019wey from ~1 year prior to the discovery to the end of September 2020. AT2019wey appeared as a ~ 1 mCrab source and stayed at this flux density for several months, displaying a hard X-ray spectrum that can be modeled as a power-law with photon index Γ ~ 1.8. In June 2020 it started to brighten and reached ~20 mCrab in ~2 months. The inclination of this system can be constrained to I ≲ 30° by modelling the reflection spectrum. Starting from late-August (~ 59082 MJD), AT2019wey entered into the hard-intermediate state (HIMS), and underwent a few week-long timescale outbursts, where the brightening in soft X-rays is correlated with the enhancement of a thermal component. Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) was observed in the HIMS. We detect no pulsation and in timing analysis of the NICER and NuSTAR data.

It is considered impossible because of system complexity and the enormous number of trials needed. This paper considers the problem for a class of digital systems that use redundancy to achieve reliability. The class is the systems that operate for a period of time without maintenance followed by a maintenance check that replaces components identified as faulty. The paper considers simulating a natural life test where a natural life test observes a number of operating periods. If the system does not fail during the test, it can be said to have a certain reliability at a certain confidence level. The approach in this paper is to make the simulated life test more efficient while maintaining realism by integrating structural arguments, information on fault occurrence, and fault injection in the lab. The major result of this paper is constructing a global fault model using the failure rate of the components and proving theorems about the model that tell how many, what kind, when, and where to inject faults. A simple example illustrates applying the theorems."

We appreciate the need for a high density, high power, environmentally-benign and carbon-neutral power system. Although fusion has been considered for over 70 years, the nearly intractable means of maintaining a hydrogen plasma at temperatures exceeding the center of the Sun increasingly delays not only commercialization but even the scientific breakeven point. As a recent JASON report notes, the world-wide energy grid is moving towards decentralization which is counter to the large tokamak fusion de-vices necessary given their underdense plasmas.

NASA has spent several years understanding and developing Lattice Confinement Fusion as an alternative to thermonuclear fusion by exploring many means of loading and triggering fusion reactions in deuterated metal lattices. Triggering has run the gamut from bremsstrahlung-initiated photo-neutrons to the role of electron screening in assisting these reactions. Electron screening may be responsible for both nuclear effects in deuterium pumped metals as well as fast neutrons observed from electrolytically driven cathodes. Electron screened fusion rate enhancement has been observed by others, including the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

NASA’s need for deep space power drove this research with a goal of a ten-year lifetime for a multi-kWe power system. Previous NASA studies have explored the use of fusion systems for nuclear thermal propulsion for manned spaceflight to the outer planets. Despite these designated uses, small-scale terrestrial power applications as well as medical isotope production are possible once scaling is achieved. ARPA-E can contribute to the Nation’s Green Energy mandates by funding research in this field that builds on condensed matter nuclear science findings by the US Navy and NASA."

Monitoring native species is essential for understanding changes in plant health throughout the year as well as how species’ distributions change inter-annually. However, current monitoring of species is limited to local efforts and cannot be efficiently conducted across more extensive regions of the basin. Project partners, including the USA National Phenology Network, United States Geological Survey, and Educating Children Outdoors, provided data and on-the-ground expertise to assist the project. NASA Earth observations, including Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Aqua and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) from the European Space Agency, provided remote sensing data that covers the large spatial extent of the basin. This study combined both data sources over the study period of 2013 – 2019 and explored the relationship between on-the-ground phenology observations and remotely sensed phenology signals. The team found that pairing the datasets required spatial coordinates to be accurately logged and that it was necessary to have consistent observations throughout the year by citizen scientists. The team found promising relationships between phenology observations and the two vegetation indices, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), when study locations were in an area with a high proportion of vegetation within a satellite pixel. The results and methods outlined in this study create new opportunities to leverage remote sensing alongside citizen science data for widespread monitoring of non-native species."

This paper presents a range of its outcomes by synthesizing results from the participating global coupled Earth system models. We limit our scope to the analysis of strictly geophysical outcomes: mainly global averages and spatial patterns of change for surface air temperature and precipitation. We also compare CMIP6 projections to CMIP5 results, especially for those scenarios that were designed to provide continuity across the CMIP phases, at the same time highlighting important differences in forcing composition, as well as in results. The range of future temperature and precipitation changes by the end of the century (2081–2100) encompassing the Tier 1 experiments based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) and SSP1-1.9 spans a larger range of outcomes compared to CMIP5, due to higher warming (by close to 1.5 °C) reached at the upper end of the 5 %–95 % envelope of the highest scenario (SSP5-8.5). This is due to both the wider range of radiative forcing that the new scenarios cover and the higher climate sensitivities in some of the new models compared to their CMIP5 predecessors. Spatial patterns of change for temperature and precipitation averaged over models and scenarios have familiar features, and an analysis of their variations confirms model structural differences to be the dominant source of uncertainty. Models also differ with respect to the size and evolution of internal variability as measured by individual models' initial condition ensemble spreads, according to a set of initial condition ensemble simulations available under SSP3-7.0. These experiments suggest a tendency for internal variability to decrease along the course of the century in this scenario, a result that will benefit from further analysis over a larger set of models. Benefits of mitigation, all else being equal in terms of societal drivers, appear clearly when comparing scenarios developed under the same SSP but to which different degrees of mitigation have been applied. It is also found that a mild overshoot in temperature of a few decades around mid-century, as represented in SSP5-3.4OS, does not affect the end outcome of temperature and precipitation changes by 2100, which return to the same levels as those reached by the gradually increasing SSP4-3.4 (not erasing the possibility, however, that other aspects of the system may not be as easily reversible). Central estimates of the time at which the ensemble means of the different scenarios reach a given warming level might be biased by the inclusion of models that have shown faster warming in the historical period than the observed. Those estimates show all scenarios reaching 1.5 °C of warming compared to the 1850–1900 baseline in the second half of the current decade, with the time span between slow and fast warming covering between 20 and 27 years from present. The warming level of 2 °C of warming is reached as early as 2039 by the ensemble mean under SSP5-8.5 but as late as the mid-2060s under SSP1-2.6. The highest warming level considered (5 °C) is reached by the ensemble mean only under SSP5-8.5 and not until the mid-2090s.d-2090s."

Aerosol retrieval algorithms often discard these glint-influenced observations because they can overwhelm the signal and are difficult to predict without knowledge of the (wind-speed-driven) ocean surface roughness. However, theoretical studies have shown that multi-angle observations of a location at geometries with and without reflected sun glint can be a rich source of information, sufficient to support simultaneous retrieval of both the aerosol state and the wind speed at the ocean surface. We are in the early stages of creating such an algorithm. In this paper, we describe our assessment of the appropriate level of parameterization for simultaneous aerosol and ocean surface property retrievals using sun glint. For this purpose, we use generalized nonlinear retrieval analysis (GENRA), an information content assessment (ICA) technique employing Bayesian inference, and simulations from the Ahmad–Fraser iterative radiative transfer code.

We find that four parameters are suitable: aerosol optical depth (τ), particle size distribution (expressed as the fine mode fraction f of small particles in a bimodal size distribution), surface wind speed (w), and relative humidity (r, to define the aerosol water content and complex refractive index). None of these parameters define ocean optical properties, as we found that the aerosol state could be retrieved with the nine MISR near-infrared views alone, where the ocean body is strongly absorbing in the open ocean. We also found that retrieval capability varies with observation geometry and that as τ increases so does the ability to determine aerosol intensive optical properties (r and f, while it decreases for w). Increases in w decrease the ability to determine the true value of that parameter but have minimal impact on retrieval of aerosol properties. We explored the benefit of excluding the two most extreme MISR view angles for which radiative transfer with the plane-parallel approximation is less certain, but we found no advantage in doing so. Finally, the impact of treating wind speed as a scalar parameter, rather than as a two-parameter directional wind, was tested. While the simpler scalar model does contribute to overall aerosol uncertainty, it is not sufficiently large to justify the addition of another dimension to parameter space.

An algorithm designed upon these principles is in development. It will be used to perform an atmospheric correction with MISR for coincident ocean color (OC) observations by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, also on the NASA Terra spacecraft. Unlike MISR, MODIS is a single-view-angle instrument, but it has a more complete set of spectral channels ideal for determination of optical ocean properties. The atmospheric correction of MODIS OC data can therefore benefit from MISR aerosol retrievals. Furthermore, higher-spatial-resolution data from coincident MISR observations may also improve glint screening."

A velocity–azimuth display analysis yields near-surface estimates of the mean horizontal wind vector υh in cases in which precipitation is present throughout the scan. From the surface return, the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) is obtained, which, by a method previously described, can be corrected for path attenuation. Comparisons between υh and the attenuation-corrected NRCS are used to derive transfer functions that provide estimates of the wind vector from the NRCS data under both rain and rain-free conditions. A reasonably robust transfer function is found by using the mean NRCS (⟨NRCS⟩) over the scan along with a filtering of the data based on a Fourier series analysis of υh and the NRCS. The approach gives good correlation coefficients between υh and ⟨NRCS⟩ at Ku band at incidence angles of 30° and 40°. The correlation degrades if the Ka-band data are used rather than the Ku band."

An atmospheric river (AR), propagating across the Middle East and North Africa, was found responsible for this extreme event. The snowmelt was triggered by precipitation and warm advection associated with the AR. Total satellite-based rainfall for April 2017 was moderately below normal, suggesting that a heavy flood can happen during dry years. The AR was fed by moisture from the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Despite its adverse societal consequences, this event was beneficial to the recovery of the desiccating Lake Urmia. The impacts of this AR were not limited to flooding; it also facilitated dust transport to the region. This distinct characteristic of the ARs in the Middle East is attributed to major mineral dust sources located along their pathways. This event was reasonably predicted at 7-day lead time, crucially important for successful early warning systems."

The TIM was held at NASA Langley Research Center on January 15-16, 2020.  Approximately 60 subject matter experts (SMEs) representing 8 aerospace manufacturers, 7 government organizations and 2 universities participated.  Expertise of the SMEs spanned the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale from the low-to-mid TRL focus of government laboratories and universities to the high TRL perspective of the regulatory organizations and aerospace manufacturers.  During this TIM, the future needs of the government regulators and manufacturers motivated the overall discussion and framed the input given by the participants.  Hence, the key objectives of the TIM were to understand existing gaps in model-based, e.g., computational materials, processing and performance predictions for aerospace materials and components and forecast how they can be matured to support material, process and part-level qualification and certification (Q&C).  The TIM focused on process-intensive metallic materials technologies, including, but not limited to, additive manufacturing.  Participation was roughly evenly divided among the processing and performance tracks, suggesting that both topic areas are generally perceived as being both valuable and requiring additional investment.  The output of this TIM may be used by both participating and other organizations, in part, as guidance for future national efforts on maturing computational materials capabilities for use in the Q&C of advanced metallic material systems in aerospace applications."

We have followed up this object in the X-rays with an ongoing campaign that started in May 2018, and that includes 265 NICER (for a total of 678 ks) and 14 Swift/XRT (26 ks) observations, as well as three simultaneous XMM-Newton/NuSTAR (158/169 ks) exposures. In the X-rays, 1ES 1927+654 shows a behaviour unlike any previously known AGN. The source is extremely variable both in spectral shape and flux, and does not show any correlation between X-ray and UV flux on timescales of hours or weeks/months. After the outburst the power-law component almost completely disappeared, and the source showed an extremely soft continuum dominated by a blackbody component. The temperature of the blackbody increases with the luminosity, going from kT ∼ 80 eV (for a 0.3–2 keV luminosity of L(0.3−2) ∼ 10^(41.5) erg/s) to ∼ 200 eV (for L(0.3−2) ∼ 10^(44) erg/s). The spectra show evidence of ionized outflows, and of a prominent feature at ∼ 1 keV, which can be reproduced by a broad emission line. The unique characteristics of 1ES 1927+654 in the X-ray band suggest that it belongs to a new type of changing-look AGN. Future X-ray surveys might detect several more objects with similar properties."

SAIC and BryceTech (formerly Bryce Space and Technology) were awarded one of these independent studies to assist NASA in better understanding: (1) the passenger demand for high-speed aviation travel; (2) the pressures on the business case for developing and operating a hypersonic aircraft for the commercial aviation market; and (3) the non-technical (i.e., societal) barriers and challenges, including the steps NASA and the Government could take to overcome those barriers and challenges. Our approach to addressing these three tasks for NASA included modeling future demand and future business operations, considering global air transportation at speeds of Mach 2 to Mach 7. The team forecast premium air travel demand through 2060 and assessed the willingness of passengers of different income and wealth levels to pay to save time on flights between 800 city pairs. With the total addressable market defined, we examined industry-level business case viability for several aircraft speed and range cases. Considering operating and manufacturing costs for routes that could be serviced profitably, as well as typical profitability targets for the aviation industry, we quantified the level of RDT&E funding available to support each business case."

Each compression resulted in a brief adiabatic enhancement of ions (electrons) driving bursts of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (whistler mode chorus) wave growth across the dayside magnetosphere. Fine-structured rising tones were observed in the EMIC wave bursts, resulting in nonlinear scattering of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt. Multipoint observations allow us to study the spatial structure and evolution of these sheath structures as they propagate Earthward from L1 as well as the spatio-temporal characteristics of the magnetospheric response. This event highlights the importance of fine-scale solar wind structure, in particular within complex sheath regions, in driving dayside phenomena within the inner magnetosphere."

(FWHM) energy resolution transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters at low energies (<1 keV),where it is very challenging to obtain X-ray calibration lines comparable to (or narrower than) the detector resolution. This scheme depends on the ability to resolve the number of 3 eV photons in each pulse, which we have recently demonstrated up to photon numbers of about 300. AtLTD-18 we showed preliminary results obtained with this technique on a 0.25 eV baseline resolution TES microcalorimeter designed for the ultra-high-resolution sub-array of the Lynx mission. The line-shape was well described by a simple Gaussian. However, the difficulty of delivering photons to the small 46 μm square absorbers resulted in a large thermal crosstalk signal, whose random nature is expected to rapidly degrade the observed energy resolution towards higher photon numbers/energies. We have since improved the coupling
between the optical fiber and the TES absorber and report here our current results."

Among the phenomena that can be studied in this energy band, some require high time resolution and stability: rotation-powered and accreting millisecond pulsars, fast variability from black holes and neutron stars, X-ray bursts, and more. Moreover, a good alignment of the timestamps of X-ray photons to UTC is
key for multi-instrument studies of fast astrophysical processes. In this paper, we describe the timing calibration of the NuSTAR mission. In particular, we present a method to correct the temperature-dependent frequency response of the on-board temperature-compensated crystal oscillator. Together with measurements of the spacecraft clock offsets obtained during downlinks passes, this allows a precise characterization of the behavior of the oscillator. The calibrated NuSTAR event timestamps for a typical observation are shown to be accurate to a precision of ∼65 μs."

Vulnerability to heat-related illnesses is further compounded by risk factors such as demographics, socioeconomic status, and pre-existing health conditions. The City of Sacramento, as California’s fastest growing city in terms of population, is particularly invested in combatting the UHI effect. The team collaborated with the City of Sacramento and urban planning firm, Dyett and Bhatia, on three main goals: assessing urban heat at the neighborhood scale; identifying priority areas for cooling interventions; and assessing heat risk to the population. This project utilized NASA Earth observation products to identify hotspots within the community areas of Sacramento and create maps of urban heat, the heat-mitigation index, and heat risk of the study period from 2016-2020. The Surface Reflectance product were used from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) thermal infrared sensor. Additionally, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Urban cooling model was used to assess the impact of increased tree canopy scenarios. Urban hotspots were identified in central Sacramento and along major transportation corridors such as Stockton Boulevard, while highest risk areas were identified in the community areas of Fruitridge/Broadway and North Sacramento. This project identified these high-opportunity areas for heat mitigation to inform the City of Sacramento's General Plan.

Algorithm science and product maintenance activities during the SMAP  extended  mission  phase  have  also  involved  periodic  algorithm  calibration  and  product  refinements to maintain or enhance product consistency and performance as well as science utility. This  report  provides  an  assessment  of  the  latest  (Version  5)  SMAP  Level  4  Carbon  (L4_C)  product.  The L4_C Version 5 (v5) global record now spans more than six years (March 2015 – present)  of  SMAP  operations  and  has  benefited  from  five  major  reprocessing  updates  to  the  operational   product.   These   reprocessing   events   and   L4_C   product   release   updates   have   incorporated  various  algorithm  refinements  and  calibration  adjustments  to  account  for  similar  refinements   to   the   upstream   GEOS   land   model   assimilation   system,   SMAP   brightness   temperatures, and MODIS vegetation inputs used for L4_C processing.

The SMAP L4_C algorithms utilize a terrestrial carbon flux model informed by daily surface and root zone soil moisture information contributed from the SMAP Level 4 Soil Moisture (L4_SM) product  along  with  optical  remote  sensing-based  (e.g.  MODIS-based)  land  cover  and  canopy  fractional photosynthetic active radiation (fPAR), and other ancillary biophysical data.  The carbon flux model estimates global daily net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and the component carbon fluxes, namely, vegetation gross primary production (GPP) and soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh). Other L4_C product elements include surface (~0-5 cm depth) soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and  associated  environmental  constraints  to  these  processes,  including  soil  moisture-related controls  on  GPP  and  ecosystem  respiration  (Kimball  et  al.  2014,  Jones  et  al.  2017).  The  L4_C  product addresses SMAP carbon cycle science objectives by: 1) providing a direct link between terrestrial carbon fluxes and underlying freeze/thaw and soil moisture-related constraints to these processes,  2)  documenting  primary  connections  between  terrestrial  water,  energy  and  carbon  cycles, and 3) improving understanding of terrestrial carbon sink activity.

The SMAP L4_C algorithms and operational product are mature and at a CEOS Validation Stage 4  level  (Jackson  et  al.  2012)  based  on  extensive  validation  of  the  multi-year  record  against  a diverse array of independent benchmarks, well characterized global performance, and systematic refinements  gained  from  five  major  reprocessing  events.  There  are  no  Level-1  mission  science  requirements  for  the  L4_C  product;  however,  self-imposed  requirements  have  been  established  focusing on NEE as the primary product field for validation, and on demonstrating L4_C accuracy and  success  in  meeting  product  science  requirements  (Jackson  et  al.  2012).  The  other  L4_C  product fields also have strong utility for carbon science applications (e.g., Liu et al. 2019, Endsley et al. 2020); however, analysis of these other fields is considered secondary relative to primary validation activities focusing on NEE. The L4_C targeted accuracy requirements are to meet or exceed a mean unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE, or standard deviation of the error) for NEE  of  1.6  g  C  m-2  d-1  and  30  g  C  m-2  yr-1, emphasizing northern (≥45°N) boreal and arctic ecosystems;  this  accuracy  is  similar  to  that  of  tower  eddy  covariance  measurement-based observations (Baldocchi 2008).  

Methods used for the latest v5 L4_C product performance and validation assessment have been established from the SMAP Cal/Val plan and previous studies (Jackson et al. 2012, Jones et al. 2017) and include: 1) consistency evaluations of the product fields against earlier product releases (version 4 or earlier); 2) comparisons of daily carbon flux estimates with independent tower eddy 
4covariance measurement-based daily carbon (CO2) flux observations from core tower validation sites (CVS); and 3) consistency checks against other global carbon products, including soil carbon inventory  records,  global  GPP  records  derived  from  tower  observation  upscaling  methods,  and  satellite-based observations of canopy solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a surrogate for  GPP.    Metrics  used  to  evaluate  relative  agreement  between  L4_C  product  fields  and  observational  benchmarks  include  correlation  (r-value),  RMSE  differences,  bias  and  model  sensitivity diagnostics.  Following these validation criteria, the present report provides a validation assessment of the latest L4_C product release (v5).  Detailed descriptions of the L4_C algorithm and additional global product accuracy and performance results are given elsewhere (Jones et al. 2017, Endsley et al. 2020). 

The v5 L4_C product replaces earlier product versions and continues to show: (i) accuracy and performance  levels  meeting  or  exceeding  SMAP  L4_C  science  requirements;  (ii)  improvement  over  the  previous  product  version  (version  4);  and  (iii)  suitability  for  a  diversity  of  science  applications.   Example   L4_C   applications   from   the   recent   literature   include   clarifying   environmental  trends  and  controls  on  the  northern  terrestrial  carbon  sink  (Liu  et  al.  2019),  diagnosing  drought-related  impacts  on  ecosystem  productivity  (Li  et  al.  2020),  and  regional  monitoring of cropland conditions for projecting annual yields (Wurster et al. 2020). 2EXPECTED L4_C ALGORITHM AND PRODUCTPERFORMANCE The L4_C algorithm performance, including variance and uncertainty estimates of model outputs, was determined during the mission pre-launch phase through spatially explicit model sensitivity studies  using  available  model  inputs  similar  to  those  currently  being  used  for  operational  production  and  evaluating  the  resulting  model  simulations  over  the  observed  range  of  northern  (≥45 °N) and global conditions (Kimball et al. 2012, Entekhabi et al. 2014). The L4_C algorithm options were also evaluated during the mission prelaunch phase, including deriving canopy fPAR from lower order NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) inputs in lieu of using MODIS (MOD15)  fPAR;  and  including  an  explicit  model  representation  of  boreal  fire  disturbance  recovery  impacts.  These  results  indicated  that  the  L4_C  accuracy  requirements  (i.e.,  NEE  ubRMSE ≤ 30 g C m-2 yr-1or ≤ 1.6 g C m-2 d-1) could be met from the baseline algorithms over more than 82% and 89% of global and northern vegetated land areas, respectively (Yi et al. 2013, Kimball et al. 2014).  The  global  L4_C  algorithm  error  budget  for  NEE  derived  during  the  mission  prelaunch  phase  indicated  that  the  estimated  NEE  ubRMSE  uncertainty  is  proportional  to  GPP  and  is  therefore  larger in higher biomass productivity areas, including forests and croplands (Kimball et al. 2014). Likewise, NEE ubRMSE uncertainty is expected to be lower in less-productive areas, including grasslands  and  shrublands.  Expected  model  NEE  ubRMSE  levels  were  also  generally  within  targeted  accuracy  levels  for  characteristically  less-productive  boreal  and  Arctic  biomes,  even  though relative model error as a proportion of total productivity (NEE RMSE / GPP) may be large in these areas. The estimated NEE uncertainty was lower than expected in some warmer tropical high biomass productivity areas (e.g. Amazon rainforest) because of reduced low temperature and moisture constraints to the L4_C respiration calculations so that the bulk of model uncertainty is contributed by GPP in these areas. Model NEE uncertainty in the African Congo was estimated to"

Anti-icing materials and coatings are of high interest to prevent aircraft icing. Because no anti-icing material suitable for in-flight situations has been realized, icing models aim to predict the accumulation and shape of the ice to understand its effects. In both cases, understanding the physical mechanism behind ice adhesion and shedding is necessary. A recent literature review has shown that the apparent ice adhesion strength to any specific material varies over several orders of magnitude across studies and test methods. One of the reasons for this high variance is likely to be the varying microstructure of the ice used for different studies. Although the microstructure of impact ice has been studied in the past, those conditions were not relevant to that of in-flight aircraft icing. The microstructure of the ice formed will determine both its bulk and surface properties, yet it has been overlooked in the ice adhesion community. Here, we use optical microscopy to study the non-uniform ice crystal grain size in impact ice accreted in NASA Glenn Research Center’s Icing Research Tunnel at various icing conditions. Similar to other environmental conditions studied in the literature, we show an increase in grain size at larger distances from the growth interface; however, the data shows substantially larger grains than what was expected from the prior literature. Ice accrued at lower temperatures has a smaller grain size at all distances from the growth interface. No change in grain size was noticed when varying only the wind speed. A correlational analysis shows that smaller grain sizes at the growth interface corresponded to an increase in the apparent ice adhesion strength when the adhesive failure was interfacial, but not when the failure was cohesive. These results may explain the overall trend in the literature of increasing apparent adhesion strength with decreasing temperature. Incorporating microstructure trends for various environmental conditions in icing models may increase the certainty in predicting ice adhesion strength and shedding, and will provide a better basis for comparison between adhesive tests on ice produced in different facilities and at different storage times."

Various theoretical approaches may be used to address this problem, but they must first be shown to reproduce reliable spectra compared to the experiment. In this work, we calculate the sulfur Kedge X-ray absorption spectra of H2S, SO2, and OCS, whose spectra are already known from X-ray experiments and predict the X-ray spectrum of CS, which as far as we are aware has not been measured, thereby hampering its detection by X-ray telescopes. We chose these four molecules as the astrochemistry of sulfur is an unsolved problem and as the four molecules are already known to exist in space. We consider three types of methods for modeling the X-ray spectra: more accurate calculations with the algebraic-diagrammatic construction (ADC) and the CC2, CCSD, and CC3coupled cluster (CC) approaches as well as more affordable ones with transition potential density functional theory (TP-DFT). A comparison of our computational results to previously reported experimental spectra shows that the core−valence separation (CVS)approaches CVS-ADC(2)-x and CVS-CC3 generally yield a good qualitative level of agreement with the experiment, suggesting that they can be used for interpreting measured spectra, while the TP-DFT method is not reliable for these molecules. However, quantitative agreement with the experiment is still outside the reach of the computational methods studied in this work."

It has been in orbit for over 18 years, during which it has been observing the high-energy sky with a set of instruments specifically designed to probe the emission from hard X-ray and softγ-ray sources. This paper is devoted to the subject of black hole binaries, which are among the most important sources that populate the high-energy sky.  We present a review of the scientific literature based on INTEGRAL data, which has significantly advanced our knowledge in the field of relativistic astrophysics. We briefly summarise the state-of-the-art of the study of black hole binaries, with a particular focus on the topics closer to the INTEGRAL science. We then give an overview of the results obtained by INTEGRAL and by other observatories on a number of sources of importance in the field.  Finally, we review the main results obtained over the past 18 years on all the black hole binaries that INTEGRAL has observed. We conclude with a summary of the main contributions of INTEGRAL to the field, and on the future perspectives"

Beginning with the Apollo missions to the Moon and extending to the recent successful sample collection by the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission, these astromaterials collections have been an invaluable resource to scientists and educators around the world. Sample studies continue to provide fundamental insight into how our solar system and its constituent bodies formed and evolved over the past 4.5 billion years. As evidence of their broad impact, there are over 19,141 samples on loan to 433 Principal Investigators in 24 countries [1].
As we plan for exploration missions through 2050, sample return missions will continue to play a vital role in NASA’s science vision. Returned samples truly are the gift that keeps on giving. Having the samples accessible on Earth allows new generations of scientists and new generations of instrumentation to pursue ever evolving scientific questions. For example, the Apollo samples were collected ~50 years ago, yet our views of how the Earth-Moon system formed, the role of volatiles in the early inner solar system, and even the positions of the gas giants in the outer solar system have changed dramatically as a result of Apollo sample analyses conducted very recently.
Vital to the long-term viability of any sample return mission is the careful curation of the samples. Curatorial efforts need to begin early in the project lifecycle, not with the return of the samples, but at mission conception. The Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office at NASA Johnson Space Center is responsible for curating all of NASA’s current and future extraterrestrial samples. Looking at possible sample return missions over the next 35+ years [2], many samples would require curation efforts a step beyond current capabilities, e.g., cold or cryogenic curation, organically and biologically clean curation, curation of gases and ices, and curation of samples with extreme pressure, temperature, or redox requirements.      
During the lecture, we discuss the current curatorial efforts in JSC curation, as well as discoveries from the astromaterial research.

Due to the rapid rise in temperature and ultrafast cooling that follows the radiation impact, the structural properties of the materials can be altered through melting, recrystallization, and amorphization. A detailed understanding of the material failure modes at the interface is lacking, specifically at the nanoscale. We use molecular simulations to investigate the ultrafast melting at tungsten (W)–SiC interfaces following radiation damage and apply deep learning techniques to track the transient evolution of the local molecular structures. We show that W near the radiation track undergoes melting and, eventually, most of it recrystallizes with a noticeable degree of undercooling, while SiC is rendered permanently amorphous. The observation of local undercooling in W films is important as it can affect the device performance even before the bulk melting temperature of the material is reached. We also show that at high temperatures, the interface undergoes a fracture-like failure. The results presented here are significant in understating the different failure modes of SiC diode materials."

The system is an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar in a 75-minute ultracompact binary. The mass donor is most likely a ≃0.02 Mꙩ finite-entropy white dwarf composed of He or C/O. The fractional rms pulsed amplitude is 7.4%, and the soft (1–3 keV) X-ray pulse profile contains a significant second harmonic. The pulsed amplitude and pulse phase lag (relative to our mean timing model) are energy dependent, each having a local maximum at 4 and 1.5 keV, respectively. We also recovered the X-ray pulsations in archival 2012 XMM-Newton observations, allowing us to measure a long-term pulsar spin-down rate of ύ= -2.1(7) x (10)^(-14) Hz/s and to infer a pulsar surface dipole magnetic field strength of ≃10^(9)G. We show that the mass transfer in the binary is likely nonconservative, and we discuss various scenarios for mass loss from the system."

This event was one of the best-localized compact binary coalescences detected in O3 (with 50%/90% error regions of 13/72 deg2), and so the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory performed rapid near-UV/X-ray follow-up observations. Swift-XRT and UVOT covered approximately 79.2% and 62.4% (respectively) of the GW error region, making S200224ca the BBH event most thoroughly followed-up in near-UV (u-band) and X-ray to date. No likely EM counterparts to the GW event were found by the Swift BAT, XRT, or UVOT, nor by other observatories. Here, we report on the results of our searches for an EM counterpart, both in the BAT data near the time of the merger, and in follow-up UVOT/XRT observations. We also discuss the upper limits we can place on EM radiation from S200224ca, as well as the implications these limits have on the physics of BBH mergers. Namely, we place a shallow upper limit on the dimensionless BH charge, qˆ < 1.4 x 10-4, and an upper limit on the isotropic-equivalent energy of a blast wave E<4.1×1051 erg (assuming typical GRB parameters)."

However, canopy SIF and RS observations are impacted by topography, vegetation three dimension (3D) structure, leaf orientation, non foliar elements (e.g., tree woody skeleton), ... Physically based downscaling of canopy SIF RS data to leaf-level (i.e., to leaf photosynthesis) requires 3D radiative transfer (RT) models simulating canopy SIF and its observation. These models are necessary to better exploit the potential of SIF, by linking leaf SIF and SIF in RS observations as a function of canopy 3D architecture and experimental configurations (sun and viewing directions, etc.). The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is a comprehensive 3D radiative transfer (RT) model for urban and natural landscapes.

However, they are being destroyed at an alarming rate by human activities. To characterize mangrove forest changes, evaluate their impacts, and support relevant protection and restoration decision making, accurate and up-to-date mangrove extent mapping at large spatial scales is essential. Available large-scale mangrove extent data products use a single machine learning method commonly with 30 m Landsat imagery, and significant inconsistencies remain among these data products. With huge amounts of satellite data involved and the heterogeneity of land surface characteristics across large geographic areas, finding the most suitable method for large-scale high-resolution mangrove mapping is a challenge. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a machine learning ensemble for mangrove forest mapping at 20 m spatial resolution across West Africa using Sentinel-2 (optical) and Sentinel-1 (radar) imagery. The machine learning ensemble integrates three commonly used machine learning methods in land cover and land use mapping, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Neural Network (NN). The cloud-based big geospatial data processing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for pre-processing Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data. Extensive validation has demonstrated that the machine learning ensemble can generate mangrove extent maps at high accuracies for all study regions in West Africa (92%–99% Producer’s Accuracy, 98%–100% User’s Accuracy, 95%–99% Overall Accuracy). This is the first-time that mangrove extent has been mapped at a 20 m spatial resolution across West Africa. The machine learning ensemble has the potential to be applied to other regions of the world and is therefore capable of producing high-resolution mangrove extent maps at global scales periodically."

It is formed photochemically by reactions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), of which wildfires are an important source. This study presents data from research flights sampling wildfires in West and Central African savannah regions, both close to the fires and after the emissions had been transported several days over the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. Emission factors (EFs) in g kg-1 for NOx (as NO), six VOCs and formaldehyde were calculated from enhancement to mole fractions in data taken close to the fires. For NOx, the emission factor was calculated as 2.05±0.43 g kg-1 for Senegal and 1.20±0.28 g kg-1 for Uganda, both higher than the average value of 1.13±0.6 g kg-1 for previous studies of African savannah regions. For most VOCs (except acetylene), EFs in Uganda were lower by factors of 20-50% compared to Senegal, with almost all the values below those in the literature. O3 enhancement in the fire plumes was investigated by examining the ΔO3/ΔCO enhancement ratio, with values ranging from 0.07 - 0.14 close to the fires up to 0.25 for measurements taken over the Atlantic Ocean up to 200 hours downwind. In addition, measurements of O3 and its precursors were compared to the output of a global chemistry transport model (GEOS-CF) for the flights over the Atlantic Ocean. Normalised mean bias (NMB) comparison between the measured and modelled data was good outside of the fire plumes, with CO showing a model under-prediction of 4.6% and O3 a slight over-prediction of 0.7% (both within the standard deviation of the data).  For NOx the agreement was poorer, with an under-prediction of 9.9% across all flights. Inside the fire plumes the agreement between modelled and measured values is worse, with the model being biased significantly lower for all three species. In total across all flights, there was an under-prediction of 29.4%, 16.5% and 37.5% for CO, O3 and NOx respectively. Finally, the measured ΔO3/ΔCO enhancement ratios were compared those in the model for the equivalent flight data, with the model showing a lower value of 0.17±0.03 compared to an observed value of 0.29±0.05. The results detailed here show that the O3 burden to the North Atlantic Ocean from African wildfires may be underestimated and that further study is required to better study the O3 precursor emissions and chemistry."

Recent studies suggest a dominant role of vapor growth processes in determining the temperature dependence of cloud top ice sizes and shapes. Using airborne cloud remote sensing along with reanalysis data, here we show that observed cloud top ice effective radii and estimated normalized growth rates at cloud top highly correlate with an approximately linear relationship, which is consistent with a conceptual model also presented. Furthermore, significant differences in crystal shape characteristics and scattering asymmetry parameters are found between sub- and super-saturated cloud tops over ocean, although not over land. These results provide valuable observational targets for studying ice formation and evolution processes using models, while also helping interpretation of satellite observations of ice microphysical properties at cloud tops."

While optical data is relatively high-resolution and does not suffer from speckle noise compared to radar data, it is very likely to be impacted by cloud and shadow. On the other hand, radar imagery can be used in all weather conditions due to its capability of penetrating clouds. Although a significant improvement of flood monitoring capability is achieved by using radar data, it is still challenging to map urban floods because of strong backscattering by man-made structures. Therefore, complementary use of optical and radar imagery in flood response is required, particularly in urban areas. In this study, we have adopted the Bayesian Joint Probability function to combine two different flood products generated from SAR and optical imagery. Flood detection with SAR data relies on the difference of backscatter signals between standing water and rougher land surface, while a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) approach is used for optical data. Specifically, Planet Dove data with its 3m spatial resolution is used with higher weight values to detect flood extent in urban areas."

Therefore, biases and errors in presently used density models confound assessments of ice sheet mass balance and by extension ice sheet contribution to sea level rise. Despite this importance, most contemporary firn densification models rely on simplified semi-empirical methods, which are partially reflected by significant modeled density errors when compared to observations. In this study, we present a new drifting-snow compaction scheme that we have implemented into SNOWPACK, a physics-based land surface snow model. We show that our new scheme improves existing versions of SNOWPACK by increasing simulated near-surface (defined as the top 10 m) density to be more in line with observations (near-surface bias reduction from −44.9 to −5.4 kg m−3). Furthermore, we demonstrate high-quality simulation of near-surface Antarctic snow and firn density at 122 observed density profiles across the Antarctic ice sheet, as indicated by reduced model biases throughout most of the near-surface firn column when compared to two semi-empirical firn densification models (SNOWPACK mean bias=−9.7 kg m−3, IMAU-FDM mean bias=−32.5 kg m−3, GSFC-FDM mean bias=15.5 kg m−3). Notably, our analysis is restricted to the near surface where firn density is most variable due to accumulation and compaction variability driven by synoptic weather and seasonal climate variability. Additionally, the GSFC-FDM exhibits lower mean density bias from 7–10 m (SNOWPACK bias=−22.5 kg m−3, GSFC-FDM bias=10.6 kg m−3) and throughout the entire near surface at high-accumulation sites (SNOWPACK bias=−31.4 kg m−3, GSFC-FDM bias=−4.7 kg m−3). However, we found that the performance of SNOWPACK did not degrade when applied to sites that were not included in the calibration of semi-empirical models. This suggests that SNOWPACK may possibly better represent firn properties in locations without extensive observations and under future climate scenarios, when firn properties are expected to diverge from their present state."

Here, we investigate a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) application of a blind symbol rate-center frequency estimator.  First, this study provides a background on the theory behind the cyclic spectral density function (CSD), spectral correlation analyzers (SCA), and spectrum sensing.  Following this is a discussion on the motivation for CubeSat spectrum sensing.  An SCA implementation for low-memory devices, such as FPGA-based CubeSat, is then describes.

The focus is on the region x/D < 43.0(D is the diameter of the TE). The upper and lower separating boundary layers are both turbulent and are statistically identical; the resulting wake is symmetric in the mean. The present study is a continuation of an earlier investigation (Case AX).  The earlier research dealt with shed vortex structure, in particular the persistence of the coherence of these vortices with increasing streamwise distance (except for infrequent, random disruption/rupture).  In addition, across-centerline movement (ACM)of shed vortices, that is prevalent past x/D = 20.0 in a cylinder case at a comparable Reynolds number, was found to be essentially absent in Case AX. In the present investigation, an underlying cause for the occasional disruption/rupture of shed vortices is explored. Strong interactions between subsequent shed vortices in the trailing edge region is found to be an important contributor to this phenomenon.    The distributions of phase-averaged streamwise and cross-stream components of intensity and the corresponding budget terms in the near wake are compared with those obtained in the intermediate wake here. In addition, the main features of the distribution of the phase-averaged velocity pressure-gradient term are compared with those of the production term, for the two intensity components. Except for a change in sign, the important features in the two budget terms are qualitatively similar for both components."

Over the period from April 2015 until December 2018, seven stations covered by the SMAP reference pixels 15 have fairly complete data records. Spatially distributed soil moisture simulations with the Dutch national hydrological model have been utilized for the development of upscaling functions to translate the spatial mean of point measurements to the domain of the SMAP reference pixels. The native and upscaled spatial soil moisture means computed using the in-situ measurements have been adopted as references to assess the performance of the SMAP i) Single Channel Algorithm at Horizontal Polarization (SCA-H), ii) Single Channel Algorithm at Vertical Polarization (SCA-V), and iii) Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA) soil moisture estimates. In the case of the Twente network it was found  that the SCA-V soil moisture retrieved SMAP observations collected in the afternoon had  the best agreement with the native spatial mean leading to an unbiased Root Mean Squared Error (uRMSE) of 0.059 m3 m-3, whereas for the upscaled in-situ references primarily larger biases were found. These error levels are larger than the mission’s target accuracy of 0.04 m3 m-3, which can be attributed to large over- and underestimation errors (>0.08 m3  m-3) in particular at the end of dry spells and during freezing, respectively. The strong vertical dielectric gradients associated with rapid soil freezing and wetting causes the disparity in soil depth characterized by SMAP and in situ that leads to the large mismatches. Once filtered for frozen conditions and antecedent rainfall the uRMSE improves to 0.043 m3 m-3."

Snow specific surface area (SSA) can be measured using stereological methods, in which snow samples are cast in the field and photographed in the laboratory. Processing stereology photographs manually by counting intersections of test cycloids with air–ice boundaries reduces the problems in binary segmentation. This paper is a case study to evaluate the repeatability of the manually stereology interpretation by two independent research groups. We further assessed how uncertainty in snow SSA influences simulated brightness temperature(TB) driven by the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS), and how stereology compares to Near Infrared (NIR) camera and hand lens. Data was obtained from two alpine snow profiles from Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Results showed that stereological SSA values measured by two groups are highly consistent, and the ground radiometer measured TBat 19 and 37 GHz was successfully predicted (RMSE<3.8 K);simulations using NIR SSA and hand-lens geometric grain size (Dg)measurements have larger errors.

Possible evidence of a gamma-ray counterpart was presented by DeLaunay et al. However, based on our analysis
using all the available BAT data, no significant emission is found in either the temporal or the image domain. We
place a 5σ fluence upper limit of 3.3 × 10−6 erg cm−2 and 2.7 × 10−6 erg cm−2 (15–150 keV) with an integration
time of 300 s assuming a simple power-law spectrum with photon index of −1.2 and −2.0, respectively. Our result
does not support the association of this FRB with a high-energy counterpart, in agreement with growing
observational evidence that most FRBs are not associated with catastrophic events such as gamma-ray bursts."

At any instance, there is a preferred (specular) spot on the globe, where a glint may be observed by EPIC. While monitoring reflectance at these spots (terrestrial glitter), we observe occasional intense glints originating from neither ocean surface nor cloud ice and we argue that mountain lakes high in the Andes are among the causes. We also examine time-averaged reflectance at the spots and find it exceeding that of neighbors, with the excess monotonically increasing with separation distance. This specular excess is found in all channels and is more pronounced in the latest and best-calibrated version of EPIC data, thus opening the possibility of testing geometric calibration by monitoring distant glitter."

The recent SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP satellites have demonstrated the value of measurements at 1400 MHz for observing surface soil moisture, sea surface salinity, sea ice thickness, soil freeze/thaw state, and other geophysical variables. However, the information obtained is limited by penetration through the subsurface at 1400 MHz and by a reduced sensitivity to surface salinity in cold or wind-roughened waters. Recent airborne experiments have shown the potential of brightness temperature measurements from 500–1400 MHz to address these limitations by enabling sensing of soil moisture and sea ice thickness to greater depths, sensing of temperature deep within ice sheets, improved sensing of sea salinity in cold waters, and enhanced sensitivity to soil moisture under vegetation canopies. However, the absence of significant spectrum reserved for passive microwave measurements in the 500–1400 MHz band requires both an opportunistic sensing strategy and systems for reducing the impact of radio-frequency interference. Here, we summarize the potential advantages and applications of 500–1400 MHz microwave radiometry for Earth observation and review recent experiments and demonstrations of these concepts. We also describe the remaining questions and challenges to be addressed in advancing to future spaceborne operation of this technology along with recommendations for future research activities."

Here we use results from a set of laboratory experiments to examine the transient response of glacier slip over a hard bed to velocity perturbations. The drag and cavity evolution from lab experiments are used to parameterize a rate-and-state drag model that is applied to observations of surface velocity and ice-bed separation from the Greenland ice sheet. The drag model successfully predicts observed lags between changes in ice-bed separation and sliding speed. These lags result from the time (or displacement) required for cavities to evolve from one steady-state condition to another. In comparing drag estimates resulting from applying rate-and-state and steady-state slip laws to transient data, we find the peaks in drag are out of phase. This suggests that in locations where subglacial conditions vary on timescales shorter than those needed for cavity adjustment transient slip processes control basal drag."

The FLDI instrument measures fluctuations at a single point in the flowfield at 10 MHz, with the resulting signal most sensitive in the region nearest the focal plane of the FLDI laser beam. The HSS instrument acquires images at 20 kHz along the same optical axis as the FLDI beam, but with the resulting signal path averaged over the entire HSS line-of-sight. The introduction of the HSS optics into the FLDI beam path provides two high-quality measurement capabilities in a single system with no degradation of performance relative to stand-alone FLDI or HSS instruments."

Such chemical complexity in cometary material implies that impacts by comets could have supplied reagents for prebiotic chemistry to young planetary surfaces. However, the assumption that some of the molecules observed in cometary comae at millimetre wavelengths originate from ices stored inside the nucleus has not yet been proven. In fact, the comae of moderately-active comets reach sufficient densities within a few thousand kilometres of the nucleus for an active (solar radiation-driven) photochemistry to ensue. Here, we present results from our latest chemical-hydrodynamic models incorporating an updated reaction network, and show that the commonly-observed HC3N (cyanoacetylene) and NH2CHO (formamide) molecules can be efficiently produced in cometary comae as a result of two-body, neutral–neutral, gas-phase reactions involving well-known coma species. In the presence of a near-nucleus distributed source of CN (similar to that observed by the Rosetta spacecraft at comet 67P), we find that sufficient HC3N and NH2CHO can be synthesized to match the abundances of these molecules observed previously in Oort cloud comets. The precise coma origins of these (and other) complex organic molecules can be verified through radio interferometric mapping observations, for example using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array."

The cross sections are determined by direct normalization to the well-known cross sections of radiative electron capture, measured simultaneously. Using contemporaneous polarization measurements with the two crystal spectrometers, whose dispersion planes are oriented parallel and perpendicular to the electron beam direction, the polarization of the direct excitation line emission is determined, and in turn the isotropic total cross sections are extracted. We further experimentally investigate various line-formation mechanisms, finding that radiative cascades and collisional inner-shell ionization dominate the degree of linear polarization and total line emission cross sections of the forbidden line, z."

We used two samples of source galaxies, selected with photometric redshifts, (0.1 < z(B) < 1.2) and (1.2 < z(B) < 2), which produce a combined detection significance of the CMB lensing and weak galaxy lensing cross-spectrum of 7.7σ. With the lower redshift galaxy sample, for which the cross-correlation was detected at a significance of 5.3σ, we present joint cosmological constraints on the matter density parameter, Ω(m), and the matter fluctuation amplitude parameter, σ(8), marginalising over three nuisance parameters that model our uncertainty in the redshift and shear calibration as well as the intrinsic alignment of galaxies. We find our measurement to be consistent with the best-fitting flat ΛCDM cosmological models from both Planck and KiDS-1000. We demonstrate the capacity of CMB weak lensing cross-correlations to set constraints on either the redshift or shear calibration by analysing a previously unused high-redshift KiDS galaxy sample (1.2 < z(B) < 2), with the cross-correlation detected at a significance of 7σ. This analysis provides an independent assessment for the accuracy of redshift measurements in a regime that is challenging to calibrate directly owing to known incompleteness in spectroscopic surveys."

The most economical involved a ‘conjunction’ class whereby the crew spends around 500 days on Mars waiting for a ‘cheap’ return. The total mission time results in over a 1000-day mission duration (about 3 years). Given the current experience level of only one year on the International Space Station (ISS), it of interest to reduce that time to only two years, thus reducing risk and minimizing required Mars surface infrastructure. The Phase 1.1 Study goal was stated as follows, “Determine the feasibility of a two-year roundtrip class Mars mission concept of operation that enables boots on Mars no later than 2036.” While the Phase1 study did show feasibility for the NEP-Chemical option, the 2036 Opposition opportunity was found to stress the schedule due to proposed technology development schedules. A 2039 Opposition (which requires even more energy than the 2036 case) was chosen as representative for Phase 1.2. Phase 1.2 also sought to further refine the concept, building on the feasibility, but addressing several challenges brought by the red team and habitat team. Given the date of 2039, nearer term technologies, primarily nuclear thermal and nuclear electric were deemed as the most viable for these missions. As will be shown, the energy required to perform such a mission in only two years (for the 2039 opportunity at least) is about three times that of the three-year conjunction mission. The rocket equation shows that this mission would then require several times the propellant of the three-year mission unless the specific impulse (ISP) of the propulsion system can be increased. Based on lunar needs, a limit of five Space Launch System (SLS) launchers with 8.4m fairings was imposed for the piloted transportation portion of the mission, limiting the size of the system. When using nuclear electric propulsion, the main limiting factor was packaging the required radiator area.  The higher Isp nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) system option is described herein but with a twist: in order to keep the size of radiators packageable in one SLS and use proven reactor power system technology (~1200K reactor outlet temperature and superalloy-class Brayton) the NEP system had to be combined with a chemical propulsion system. This combination of electric propulsion and high thrust chemical was found to be useful in previous design studies combining solar electric propulsion (SEP) and chemical propulsion. Such a combination allowed the low-thrust system to provide significant change in velocity (∆V) during the interplanetary portions of the mission, thereby notably reducing the ∆V required by the high thrust system to capture and depart from the Mars gravity well. Here the high thrust ‘impulsive’ system is more efficient due to the Oberth Effect.  A plethora of trades, both at the mission and system level, as well as the subsystem level were performed to develop these vehicle concepts. An entire family of NEP-Chemical transportation vehicles is described herein. The main driver and the primary focus was the piloted vehicle but additional concepts for cargo were performed using the same ‘building blocks’ in order to reduce costs and provide commonality."

Most  of  these  X-ray  spectra  are  well  fit  by  an  absorbed  power  law  model,  as expected  for  a  population  dominated  by  blazars  and  pulsars.   A  small  subset  of  7  X-ray  sources ave spectra unlike the power law expected from a blazar or pulsar and may be linked to coincident stars or background emission.  We develop a multiwavelength machine learning classifier to categorize unassociated sources into pulsars and blazars using gamma- and X-ray observations. Training a random forest procedure with known pulsars and blazars, we achieve a cross-validated classification accuracy of 98.6%.  Applying the random forest routine to the unassociated sources returned 126 likely blazar candidates  (defined  as P(bzr) ≥ 90%)  and  5  likely  pulsar  candidates  (P(bzr) ≤ 10%).   Our  new  X-ray spectral analysis does not drastically alter the random forest classifications of these sources compared to  previous  works,  but  it  builds  a  more  robust  classification  scheme  and  highlights  the  importance of X-ray spectral fitting.  Our procedure can be further expanded with UV, visual, or radio spectral parameters or by measuring flux variability."

Here we present 17 new TDEs that have been detected recently by the Zwicky Transient Facility along with Swift UV and X-ray follow-up observations. Our homogeneous analysis of the optical/UV light curves, including 22 previously known TDEs from the literature, reveals a clean separation of light-curve properties with spectroscopic class. The TDEs with Bowen fluorescence features in their optical spectra have smaller blackbody radii, lower optical luminosities, and higher disruption rates compared to the rest of the sample. The small subset of TDEs that show only helium emission lines in their spectra have the longest rise times, the highest luminosities, and the lowest rates. A high detection rate of Bowen lines in TDEs with small photometric radii could be explained by the high density that is required for this fluorescence mechanism. The stellar debris can provide a source for this dense material. Diffusion of photons through this debris may explain why the rise and fade timescale of the TDEs in our sample are not correlated. We also report, for the first time, the detection of soft X-ray flares from a TDE on∼day timescales. Based on the fact that the X-ray flares peak at a luminosity similar to the optical/UV blackbody luminosity, we attribute them to brief glimpses through a reprocessing layer that otherwise obscures the inner accretion flow."

The inner magnetosphere is the region that contains the plasmasphere, ring current, and the radiation belts all co-located within about 6.6 Re, nominally taken to be bounding this region. This region is highly dynamic and is home to a variety of plasma waves and particle populations ranging in energy from a few eV to
relativistic and ultra-relativistic electrons and ions. The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) embedded in the solar wind via the process of magnetic reconnection at the sub-solar point sets up plasma convection and creates the magnetotail. Magnetic reconnection also occurs in the tail and is responsible for explosive phenomena known as substorms. Substorms inject low-energy particles into the inner magnetosphere and help generate and sustain plasma waves. Transients in the solar wind such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs), and interplanetary shocks compress the magnetosphere resulting in geomagnetic storms, energization, and loss of energetic electrons in the outer radiation belt and enhance the ring current, thereby driving the geomagnetic
dynamics. The Specification and Prediction of the Coupled Inner-Magnetospheric Environment (SPeCIMEN) is one of the four elements of VarSITI (Variability of the Sun and Its Terrestrial Impact) program which seeks to quantitatively predict and specify the inner magnetospheric environment based on Sun/solar wind driving inputs. During the past 4 years, the SPeCIMEN project has brought together scientists and researchers from across the world and facilitated their efforts to achieve the project goal. This review provides an overview of some of the significant scientific advances in understanding the dynamical processes and their interconnectedness during the VarSITI era. Major space missions, with instrument suites providing in situ measurements, ground-based programs, progress in theory, and modeling are briefly discussed. Open outstanding questions and future directions of inner magnetospheric research are explored."

We use archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array observatories, taken during different outbursts of the source between 1998 and 2015. Our modeling includes two relatively new advances in modern reflection codes: high-density disks, and returning thermal disk radiation. Accretion disks around stellar-mass black holes are expected to have densities well above the standard value assumed in traditional reflection models (i.e., n(e) ∼ 10^(15) per cu. cm). New high-density reflection models have important implications in the determination of disk truncation (i.e., the disk inner radius). This is because one must retain self-consistency in the irradiating flux and corresponding disk ionization state, which is a function of disk density and system geometry. We find that the disk density is n(e) ≥ 10^(20) per cu.  cm across all spectral states. This density, combined with our constraints on the ionization state of the material, implies an irradiating flux impinging on the disk that is consistent with the expected theoretical estimates. Returning thermal disk radiation—the fraction of disk photons that bend back to the disk producing additional reflection components—is expected predominantly in the soft state. We show that returning radiation models indeed provide a better fit to the soft-state data, reinforcing previous results that show that in the soft state, the irradiating continuum may be blackbody emission from the disk itself."

We restricted our analysis to 0.4–2.5 µm to avoid the wavelengths where thermal emission from the asteroid dominates (>2.5 µm).  Bennu has global photometric properties typical of dark asteroids; we found a geometric albedo of 0.046 ± 0.007 and a linear phase slope of 0.024 ± 0.007 mag deg–1 at 0.55 µm.  The average spectral slope of Bennu’s normal albedo is –0.0030 µm–1, and the phase reddening parameter is 4.3´10–4 µm–1 deg–1, both over the spectral range of 0.5–2.0 µm.  We produced normal albedo maps and phase slope maps at all spectral channels, from which we derived spectral slope and phase reddening maps.  Correlation analysis suggests that phase slope variations on Bennu are likely due to photometric roughness variation.  A correlation between photometric roughness and thermal roughness is evident, implying that the roughness of Bennu is self-similar on scales from tens of microns to meters.  Our analysis reveals latitudinal trends in the spectral color slope and phase reddening on Bennu.  The equatorial region appears to be redder than the global average, and the spectral slope decreases towards higher latitudes.  Phase reddening on Bennu is relatively weak in the equatorial region and shows an asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres.  We attributed the latitudinal trend to the geophysical conditions on Bennu that result in a global pattern of mass flow towards the equator."

Here we present a new, ca. 50-thousand year (ka)-long chironomid record from Füramoos, southern Germany, covering the interval from MIS 5a to MIS 3 that we use to examine lake development and then to quantitatively reconstruct mean July air temperatures. Chironomid assemblages with high abundances of taxa such as Polypedilum nubeculosum-type, Microtendipes pedellus-type, Cladopelma lateralis-type and Dicrotendipes nervosus-type imply a shallow-lake setting for the majority of the examined interval, which is corroborated by other aquatic remains such as oribatid mites, Sialidae and Ceratopogonidae. Assemblages from the interval ca. 99 to 80 ka (in the region corresponding to the Brörup Interstadial, Stadial B and early Odderade Interstadial) are dominated by taxa such as Tanytarsus glabrescens-type and Tanytarsus mendax-type and indicate relatively warm temperatures. Assemblages from the interval covering ca. 80 to 54 ka (corresponding to the late Odderade, Stadial C, Dürnten Interstadial and Stadial D) are dominated by taxa such as Sergentia coracina-type and Tanytarsus lugens-type and are typical for cooler conditions. Reconstructed July temperatures for the early Würmian (Brörup to early Odderade; ca. 99–80 ka) are 13–14 °C. Values decline to <10 °C during the late Odderade and Stadial C (ca. 80–77 ka) around the MIS 5a/4 transition. This decrease is coeval with a pronounced decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Values stay in the range of 9–11 °C during the Dürnten and Stadial D (ca. 54–74.5 ka) and increase again to 12.5 °C during the Bellamont 1 interstadial (ca. 54–46 ka). Reconstructed July temperatures track changes in arboreal pollen percentages at Füramoos and agree with a summer-temperature decrease during the early to mid-Würmian as reported by other palaeotemperature records from Europe and the North Atlantic. Our chironomid record from Füramoos provides valuable new insights into Würmian climate dynamics in Central Europe, and corroborates other temperature reconstructions from the early to mid-Würmian glacial period."

Although the radiometer operates in the protected 1400–1427 MHz portion of the radio spectrum, its measurements are still corrupted by either radio frequency interference (RFI) from out-of-band emissions via legal sources or by sources operating in-band illegally. The SMAP radiometer includes a digital backend that enables implementation of multiple ground-based RFI detection and filtering algorithms. This data is used to collect statistics and trends of Earth's RFI environment. This article examines properties of the global RFI environment as observed by SMAP, including information on RFI source properties (obtained from analysis of SMAP multiple detector outputs) and the evolution of the RFI environment in time. Residual RFI contributions after the application of SMAP RFI processing are also examined as preliminary information for the development of future methods to address their effect."

The benchmark problems included the transonic Ringleb flow, vortex transport by uniform flow, and laminar boundary layer on a flat plate.  Simulation results from all three benchmark problems showed that the Fluent solutions had less error than the ez4d solutions for a given degree of freedom.  As expected, both the Fluent and ez4d solutions had larger errors for a given degree of freedom than the simulations that used the FR method because both Fluent and ez4d utilized a second-order scheme whereas the FR codes utilized a fourth-order scheme."

LCSs, however, are affected by environment and source conditions. To establish high-quality data, LCSs must be collocated and calibrated with reference grade PM2.5 monitors. From March 2020, a low-cost PurpleAir PM2.5 monitor was collocated with a Met One Beta Attenuation Monitor 1020 in Accra, Ghana. While previous studies have shown that multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest regression (RF) can improve accuracy and correlation between PurpleAir and reference data, MLR and RF yielded suboptimal improvement in the Accra collocation (R2 = 0.81 and R2 = 0.81, respectively). We present the first application of Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) to air quality data calibration and demonstrate improvement over traditional methods by increasing the collocated PM2.5 correlation and accuracy to R2 = 0.88 and MAE = 2.2 μg/cu. m. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are a probability density estimator and clustering method from which nonlinear regressions that tolerate missing inputs can be derived. We find that even when given missing inputs, GMR provides better correlation than MLR and RF performed with complete data. GMR also allows us to estimate calibration certainty. When evaluated, 95% confidence intervals agreed with reference PM2.5 data 96% of the time, suggesting that the model accurately assesses its own confidence. Additionally, clustering within the GMM is consistent with climate characteristics, providing confidence that the calibration approach can learn underlying relationships in data."

On planets orbiting different stellar types, red edge analogs may occur at other colors than red. Thus, knowing the wavelengths at which photosynthetic organisms preferentially absorb and reflect photons is necessary to detect red edge analogs on other planets. Using a numerical model that predicts the absorbance spectrum of extant photosynthetic pigments on Earth from Marosvolgyi & van Gorkom (2010), we calculate the absorbance spectrum for pigments on an Earth-like planet around F through late M type stars that are adapted for maximal energy production. In this model, cellular energy production is maximized when pigments are tuned to absorb at the wavelength that maximizes energy input from incident photons while minimizing energy losses due to thermal emission and building cellular photosynthetic apparatus. We find that peak photon absorption for photosynthetic organisms around F type stars tends to be in the blue while for G, K, and early M type stars, red or just beyond is preferred. Around the coolest M type stars, these organisms may preferentially absorb in the near-infrared, possibly past 1 micron. These predictions are consistent with previous, qualitative estimates of pigment absorptance. Our predicted absorbance spectra for photosynthetic surface organisms depend on both the stellar type and planetary atmospheric composition, especially atmospheric water vapor concentrations, which alter the availability of surface photons and thus the predicted pigment absorption. By constraining the absorbance spectra of alien, photosynthetic organisms, future observations may be better equipped to detect the weak spectral signal of red edge analogs."

The present paper is related to the NASA-led roughness experiment on the secondary side of the BOLT-II configuration. First, computations are performed to aid mean-flow based correlations for the transition measurements acquired during an experimental campaign in the Ludwieg Tube facility at the United States Air Force Academy. To that end, both laminar and turbulent flow computations are performed for selected conditions of the experiment with a 1:3 scale model of the slightly shorter BOLT configuration. The variation in well-known correlation parameters for transition due to isolated roughness elements with respect to element position, height, and flow Reynolds number is delineated. Furthermore, the wake instability theory is used to examine the amplification of unstable disturbances behind the centerline trip at the design conditions of the BOLT-II flight experiment and for its dynamically scaled version on the 1:3 scale model of the wind tunnel experiment. To our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of the wake instabilities in the presence of a prominent entropy layer outside the boundary layer. At the nominal flight design condition of Re<sub>∞</sub>) = 5.44 and Re<sub>∞</sub> = 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup>/m, a diamond planform (“pizza-box”) trip with k/δ = 0.70 and planform-halfwidth-to-height ratio of b/k = 3.0 at X/L = 0.254 induces a strong distortion of the boundary-layer flow in the vicinity of the symmetry plane, such that the wake structure includes a centerline streak produced by the flow retardation behind the trip along with multiple additional, prominent vorticity structures representing the necklace vortex system. Stability results reveal that each of these streaks can support a strong amplification of wake instabilities within a frequency band of 95 kHz–255 kHz, with a peak N-factor of greater than 15 beyond X/L ≈ 0.42. The dynamically scaled wind tunnel configuration with Re<sub>∞</sub> = 20.25 x 10<sup>6</sup>/m is also found to support N > 15 at similar axial stations."

The applied potential strongly affects the dK/dt-dependence of EAC with results suggesting a minimal influence for potentials more positive than −830 mVSCE and a stronger dK/dt-dependence for potentials more negative than −830 mV_SCE. Crack growth rates measured using rising versus static K testing are compared, which demonstrates that rising K methods consistently yield conservative EAC metrics with increased efficiency."

The scheduling is carried out by computer systems owned by the private operators of the flights, which interface through a centralized independent server. The scheduling requires determining which of the group of flights at hand (whether owned by the same operator or different ones) are to have the advantage of being scheduled before the others. A chosen method of grouping and prioritizing flights must: have the ability to schedule a flight promptly, prevent scheduling conflicts between pairs of overlapping flight routes, and be computationally feasible. Scheduling flights one by one is the First Come First Served policy. Scheduling too many at a time is infeasible. The type of scheduling policy proposed herein, called bin-and-sort, is an attempt to reach a compromise between these two extremes. Bin-and-sort allows for each operator to choose its criteria for prioritizing its flights, and for the centralized component to use different arbitration criteria. A number of these criteria are used in the simulation presented herein. The results of each criterion choice are reported and analyzed."

This paper describes the efforts made towards the integration of two such services in a simulation environment under ideal conditions and the subsequent studies done on evaluation of system performance. The scheduling and separation services are set up to complement each other to ensure safe separation between airborne aircraft. The utility of these services will become important as the level of traffic increases. This paper describes the simulation experiments conducted to identify cases where the system performance measured by the number of observed losses of separation degrades even with the scheduling and separation services active. From the results obtained, we identify conditions under which the required maneuvers increase and when we observe airborne conflicts even with separation service active. Results obtained will inform requirements for future advancements both in these services independently and in their joint operations."

These fields channel the dense, radiatively driven stellar wind into circumstellar magnetospheres, whose density and velocity structure can be probed using ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy of wind-sensitive resonance lines. Coupled with appropriate magnetosphere models, UV spectroscopy provides a valuable way to investigate the wind–field interaction, and can yield quantitative estimates of the wind parameters of magnetic massive stars. We report a systematic investigation of the formation of UV resonance lines in slowly rotating magnetic massive stars with dynamical magnetospheres. We pair the analytic dynamical magnetosphere (ADM) formalism with a simplified radiative transfer technique to produce synthetic UV line profiles. Using a grid of models, we examine the effect of magnetosphere size, the line strength parameter, and the cooling parameter on the structure and modulation of the line profile. We find that magnetic massive stars uniquely exhibit redshifted absorption at most viewing angles and magnetosphere sizes, and that significant changes to the shape and variation of the line profile with varying line strengths can be explained by examining the individual wind components described in the ADM formalism. Finally, we show that the cooling parameter has a negligible effect on the line profiles."

This methodology tracks microwave resonances observed in reflected scattering parameters extracted from materials under load.  In this paper, we report the successful measurement of the stress-optic-coefficient of bulk yttria-partially stabilized zirconia (YTZP) ceramic of C = 1.42 x 10-4 ± 6.65 x 10-6 (1/GPa), across W-Band (80-100 GHz), and determined that this result is independent of sample thickness.  The primary goal of this research is to establish a methodology to quantify and assess the life expectancy of ceramic thermal and environmental barrier coating (TBCs/EBCs).  Bulk YTZP samples can undergo multiple resonances within a contiguous measurement bandwidth, each corresponding to an integer multiple wave number ∝.  This allows for the acquisition and analysis of multiple stress measurement points within a single sample.  As an additional benefit, one can approximate the refractive index of YTZP across a wide bandwidth by observing multiple resonances produced by a set of samples with varying thicknesses. Using this approach, the refractive index of bulk YTZP was found to be n = 5.80 ± 0.043 across the 85-115 GHz frequency band."

In order to study the effects of atmospheric aerosols in this warming, recent past (1990–2014) and future (2015–2050) simulations have been carried out using the GISS-E2.1 Earth system model to study the aerosol burdens and their radiative and climate impacts over the Arctic (>60°N), using anthropogenic emissions from the Eclipse V6b and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) databases, while global annual mean greenhouse gas concentrations were prescribed and kept fixed in all simulations.

Results showed that the simulations have underestimated observed surface aerosol levels, in particular black carbon (BC) and sulfate (SO2−4), by more than 50 %, with the smallest biases calculated for the atmosphere-only simulations, where winds are nudged to reanalysis data. CMIP6 simulations performed slightly better in reproducing the observed surface aerosol concentrations and climate parameters, compared to the Eclipse simulations. In addition, simulations where atmosphere and ocean are fully coupled had slightly smaller biases in aerosol levels compared to atmosphere-only simulations without nudging.

Arctic BC, organic aerosol (OA), and SO2−4 burdens decrease significantly in all simulations by 10 %–60 % following the reductions of 7 %–78 % in emission projections, with the Eclipse ensemble showing larger reductions in Arctic aerosol burdens compared to the CMIP6 ensemble. For the 2030–2050 period, the Eclipse ensemble simulated a radiative forcing due to aerosol–radiation interactions (RFARI) of −0.39 ± 0.01 W/sq. m, which is −0.08 W/sq. m larger than the 1990–2010 mean forcing (−0.32 W/sq. m), of which −0.24 ± 0.01 W/sq. m was attributed to the anthropogenic aerosols. The CMIP6 ensemble simulated a RFARI of −0.35 to −0.40 W/sq. m for the same period, which is −0.01 to −0.06 W/sq. m larger than the 1990–2010 mean forcing of −0.35 W/sq. m. The scenarios with little to no mitigation (worst-case scenarios) led to very small changes in the RFARI, while scenarios with medium to large emission mitigations led to increases in the negative RFARI, mainly due to the decrease in the positive BC forcing and the decrease in the negative SO2−4 forcing. The anthropogenic aerosols accounted for −0.24 to −0.26 W/sq. m of the net RFARI in 2030–2050 period, in Eclipse and CMIP6 ensembles, respectively. Finally, all simulations showed an increase in the Arctic surface air temperatures throughout the simulation period. By 2050, surface air temperatures are projected to increase by 2.4 to 2.6 °C in the Eclipse ensemble and 1.9 to 2.6 °C in the CMIP6 ensemble, compared to the 1990–2010 mean.

Overall, results show that even the scenarios with largest emission reductions leads to similar impact on the future Arctic surface air temperatures and sea-ice extent compared to scenarios with smaller emission reductions, implying reductions of greenhouse emissions are still necessary to mitigate climate change."

Estimation of the variability of the ocean mixed layer is therefore important for atmosphere-ocean prediction and analysis. The increasing coverage of in situ Argo profile data allows for an increasingly accurate analysis of the mixed layer depth (MLD) variability associated with deviations from the seasonal climatology. However, sampling rates are not sufficient to fully resolve subseasonal (<90 day) MLD variability. Yet, many multivariate observations-based analyses include implicit modeled subseasonal MLD variability. One analysis method is optimal interpolation of in situ data, but the interior analysis can be improved by leveraging surface data with regression or variational approaches. Here, we demonstrate how machine learning methods and satellite sea surface temperature, salinity, and height facilitate MLD estimation in a pilot study of two regions: the mid-latitude southern Indian and the eastern equatorial Pacific Oceans. We construct multiple machine learning architectures to produce weekly 1/2° gridded MLD anomaly fields (relative to a monthly climatology) with uncertainty estimates. We test multiple traditional and probabilistic machine learning techniques to compare both accuracy and probabilistic calibration. We validate our methodology by applying it to ocean model simulations. We find that incorporating sea surface data through a machine learning model improves the performance of spatiotemporal MLD variability estimation compared to optimal interpolation of Argo observations alone. These preliminary results are a promising first step for the application of machine learning to MLD prediction."

Ultralight, asteroid-mass PBHs with masses around1017g are particularly interesting as current observations allow them to constitute the entire DM density. PBHs in this mass range emit∼MeV photons via Hawking radiation which can directly be detected by the gamma ray telescopes, such as the upcoming AMEGO. In this work we forecast how well an instrument with the sensitivity of AMEGO will be able to detect, or rule out, PBHs as a DM candidate, by searching for their evaporating signature when marginalizing over the Galactic and extra-Galactic gamma-ray back-grounds. We find that an instrument with the sensitivity of AMEGO could exclude nonrotating PBHs as the only DM component for masses up to7×1017g at 95% confidence level for a monochromatic mass distribution, improving upon current bounds by nearly an order of magnitude. The forecasted constraints are more stringent for PBHs that have rotation, or which follow extended mass distributions"

However, estimations of soil moisture taken from current sun-synchronous orbit (SSO) satellites  are limited in  that  they  are neither  spatially  nor  temporally  continuous.  This limitation   creates discontinuous soil   moisture   observation   from   space and hampers our understanding of the fundamental processes that control the surface hydrologic cycle across both time  and  space  domains. Here,  we  propose  to  use  frequent  soil  moisture  observations  from NASA’s constellation  of eight  micro-satellites called  the Cyclone  Global  Navigation  Satellite System(CYGNSS) together with the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) to assimilate subdaily-scale  soil  moisture intoa  land  surface  model(LSM). Our results, which are based  on  triple collocation  analysis(TCA), show how  current  scientific  advances  in  satellite  systems  can  fill previous gaps in soil moisture observations in subdaily scale bypast observations, and eventually adds value to improvements in global scale soil moisture estimates in LSMs. Overall, TCA-based fractional  mean  square  errors  (fMSE)  of  LSM  soil  moisture  are  improved  by  61%  with  the synergetic  assimilation  of  CYGNSS  data  with  SMAP  soil  moisture  observations.  However, assimilating satellite-based soil moisture over dense vegetation areas can degrade the performance of LSMs as these areas propagate erroneous soil moisture information to LSMs. To our knowledge, this study isthe first global assimilation of GNSS-based soil moisture observations in land surface models."

These observations, collected with two broadband filters centered at 3.6 and 4.5 μm, were done in order to study the surface composition of TNOs, which are too faint to obtain spectroscopic measurements. With this aim, we have developed a method for the identification of different materials that are found on the surfaces of TNOs. In our sample, we detected objects with colors that are consistent with the presence of small amounts of water, and we were able to distinguish between surfaces that are predominantly composed of complex organics and amorphous silicates. We found that 86% of our sample have characteristics that are consistent with a certain amount of water ice, and the most common composition (73% of the objects) is a mixture of water ice, amorphous silicates, and complex organics. Twenty-three percent of our sample may include other ices, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, or methanol. Additionally, only small objects seem to have surfaces dominated by silicates. This method is a unique tool for the identification of complex organics and to obtain the surface composition of extremely faint objects. Furthermore, this method will be beneficial when using the James Webb Space Telescope for differentiating groups within the trans-Neptunian population."

Uniquely amongst EHe stars, its lightcurve has been reported to be modulated entirely by rotation, suggesting the presence of a magnetic field. Here we report the first high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of HD 144941, in which we detect an extremely strong magnetic field both in circular polarization (with a line-of-sight magnetic field averaged over the stellar disk〈Bz〉 ∼ −8 kG) and in Zeeman splitting of spectral lines (yielding a magnetic modulus of〈B〉 ∼17 kG). We also report for the first time weak Hαemission consistent with an origin an a Centrifugal Magnetosphere (CM). HD 144941’s atmospheric parameters could be consistent with either a subdwarf or a main sequence (MS) star, and its surface abundances are neither similar to other EHe stars nor to He-strong magnetic stars. However, its Hαemission properties can only be reproduced if its mass is around 1 M⊙, indicating that it must be a post-MS object.

A linear fissure parallel to the trough may be the source of a fountaining event yielding a cryoclastic deposit having the same composition and color properties as is found in the trough and crater. Spectral maps of this region with the New Horizons LEISA instrument reveal the spectral signature of H2O ice in these structures and in distributed patches in the adjacent terrain in Viking Terra. A detailed statistical analysis of the spectral maps shows that the colored H2O ice filling material also carries the 2.2-μm signature of an ammoniated component that may be an ammonia hydrate (NH3·nH2O) or an ammoniated salt. This paper advances the view that the crater and fossa trough have been flooded by a cryolava debouched from Pluto's interior along fault lines in the trough and in the floor of the impact crater. The now frozen cryolava consisted of liquid H2O infused with the red-brown pigment presumed to be a tholin, and one or more ammoniated compounds. Although the abundances of the pigment and ammoniated compounds entrained in, or possibly covering, the H2O ice are unknown, the strong spectral bands of the H2O ice are clearly visible. In consideration of the factors in Pluto's space environment that are known to destroy ammonia and ammonia-water mixtures, the age of the exposure is of order ≤109 years. Ammoniated salts may be more robust, and laboratory investigations of these compounds are needed."

Dome-C is a high-altitude Earth target located on the East Antarctic interior plateau, which has a permanent bright, flat, and homogeneous snow-covered surface with little aerosol, cloud cover, snowfall, and water vapor burden. This paper describes angular directional models for characterizing the  Dome-C top-of-atmosphere  (TOA)radiances as  a  function  of cosine  solar zenith angle for pre-solstice and post-solstice conditions. The 0.86-μm channel Dome-C reflectance decreases over the summer due to snow metamorphosisis not observed by the visible channels. Coinciding Terra and AquaMODIS Dome-C reflectance showed occasional inter-annual anomalies when compared against the deep convective cloud and Libya-4 invariant targets observations. Further characterization of the Dome-C reflectances with the Dome-C surface broadband albedo, Antarctic Oscillation(AAO) index, and ozone concentration values were evaluated. A strong correlation with ozone  was  found  for  the 0.55-μm  and  0.65-μm MODIS channels. The monthly Dome-C reflectances  were linearly regressed with ozone to derive the ozone correction coefficients. The uncertainty in the Aqua-and Terra-MODIS Dome-C trends was  reduced by  half  after  applying  ozone  corrections to both  the 0.55-μm  and  0.65-μm channelTOA observations."

These data were combined with previously published data to quantify the abundances of F, Cl, and H2O in the bulk silicate portion of asteroid 4 Vesta (BSV). Using a combination of apatite-based melt hygrometry/chlorometry and appropriately paired volatile/refractory element ratios, we determined that BSV has 3.0–7.2 ppm F, 0.39–1.8 ppm Cl, and 3.6–22 ppm H2O. The abundances of F and H2O are depleted in BSV relative to CI chondrites to a similar degree as F and H2O in the bulk silicate portion of the Moon. This degree of volatile depletion in BSV is similar to what has been determined previously for many moderately volatile elements in 4 Vesta (e.g., Na, K, Zn, Rb, Cs, and Pb). In contrast, Cl is depleted in 4 Vesta by a greater degree than what is recorded in samples from Earth or the Moon. Based on the Cl-isotopic compositions of eucrites and the bulk rock Cl/F ratios determined in this study, the eucrites likely formed through serial magmatism of a mantle with heterogeneous δ37Cl and Cl/F, not as extracts from a partially crystallized global magma ocean. Furthermore, the volatile depletion and Cl-isotopic heterogeneity recorded in eucrites is likely inherited, at least in part, from the precursor materials that accreted to form 4 Vesta and is unlikely to have resulted solely from degassing of a global magma ocean, magmatic degassing of eucrite melts, and/or volatile loss during thermal metamorphism. Although our results can be reconciled with the past presence of wide-scale melting on 4 Vesta (i.e., a partial magma ocean), any future models for eucrite petrogenesis involving a global magma ocean would need to account for the preservation of a heterogeneous eucrite source with respect to Cl/F ratios and Cl isotopes."

This limitation makes small, lo w-p o we r AI microchip architectures, such as the Google Coral Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), attractive for space missions where the application-specific design enables both high-performance and power-efficient computing for AI applications. To address these challenging considerations for space deployment, this research introduces the design and capabilities of a CubeSat-sized Edge TPU-based co-processor card, known as the SpaceCube Low-power Ed g e  Artificial Intelligence Resilient Node (SC-LEARN).

However, growing crops outside of Earth’s orbit creates many new challenges. The KCS SCP Project Scientists have developed a method of organizing these challenges, called the Gaps List. This Gaps List is a dynamic, taxonomically arranged list of missing knowledge and technologies needed to reach production  goals. The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the effectiveness and current research coverage of the Gaps List by using it to document KSC SCP Program research. It was determined  that there are several needs within the SCP Program that are not being met, as well as, many deficiencies within the Gaps List. Gaps involving hardware were largely unrecognized by both the KSC researchers and the funding sources that would typically support them. The KSC SCP Project will require more engineering and physical sciences support to fill those gaps. The Gaps List was found to be out of date and in need of rearrangement. A recommendation from this review was that the Gaps List be reassessed at regular intervals to ensure all gaps, and relevant research topics are included. To better understand the gaps within the list, any assessment needs to include a measure of priority, dependency, and breadth. These measures may be included within or alongside the current taxonomical arrangement of the Gaps List."

However, the extent to which independent middle atmosphere analyses differ in their representation of wave-induced coupling to the ionosphere is unclear. To begin to address this issue, we present the first intercomparison among four such analyses, JAGUAR-DAS, MERRA-2,  NAVGEM-HA,  and WACCMX+DART, focusing  on the Northern Hemisphere (NH) 2009-2010 winter, which includes a major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). This intercomparison examines the altitude, latitude, and time dependences of zonal mean zonal winds and temperatures among  these  four analyses over the 1 December  2009 – 31 March 2010 period, as well as latitude and altitude dependences of monthly mean amplitudes of the diurnal and semidiurnal migrating solar tides, the eastward propagating diurnal zonal wave number 3 nonmigrating tide, and traveling planetary waves associated with the quasi-5-day and quasi-2-day Rossby modes. Our results show generally good agreement among the four    analyses up to the stratopause (~50 km altitude). Large discrepancies begin to emerge in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere owing to (1) differences in the types of satellite data assimilated by each system and (2) differences in the details of the global atmospheric models used by each analysis system. The results of this intercomparison provide initial estimates of uncertainty in analyses commonly used to constrain middle  atmospheric meteorological variability in whole atmosphere model simulations."

One potential noise source for these instruments is interaction with the solar wind, in particular the free electrons in the interplanetary plasma. Variations in the integrated column density of free electrons along the laser links will lead to time-of-flight delays which directly compete with signals produced by gravitational waves. In this paper we present a simplified model of the solar plasma relevant for this problem, anchor key parameters of our model using data from the NASA Wind/solar wind experiment instrument, and derive estimates for the effect in the LISA measurement. We find that under normal solar conditions, the gravitational wave sensitivity limit from the free-electron effect is smaller than other noise sources that are expected to limit LISA’s sensitivity."

Within the funding for scientific research, there is an overarching trend towards increasing the scale of observations both temporally and spatially, while simultaneously reducing the cost per sample, driving a systemic shift towards autonomous sensors and observations. Legacy aCDOM(λ) measurement techniques can be cost-prohibitive and do not lend themselves toward autonomous systems. Spectrally rich datasets carefully collected with advanced optical systems in diverse locations that span a global range of water bodies, in conjunction with appropriate quality assurance and processing, allow for the analysis of methods and algorithms to estimate aCDOM(440) from spectrally constrained one- and two-band subsets of the data. The resulting algorithms were evaluated with respect to established fit-for-purpose criteria as well as quality assured archival data. Existing and proposed optical sensors capable of exploiting the algorithms and intended for autonomous platforms are identified and discussed. One-band in-water algorithms and two-band above-water algorithms showed the most promise for practical use (accuracy of 3.0% and 6.5%, respectively), with the latter demonstrated for an airborne dataset."

These balances are delicate, complex instruments. Due to the nature of this high-precision complexity, balances are expensive and time-consuming to produce. These factors can limit the design potential of the model because using conventionally manufactured balances generally means that the model is designed to accommodate balances that already exist. Ideally, engineers would be able to design a measurement system that is tailored to fit the needs of the model, rather than the other way around. The goal of this research project was to determine if it is possible to overcome these drawbacks by designing a wind tunnel model with a modifiable integrated force measurement system that leverages additive manufacturing. This was undertaken by utilizing the existing UT-63 wind tunnel balance (measurement system), integrating it with a model based on the existing AGARD-B model, and performing stress analysis to optimize the design. Due to time constraints, the result of this endeavor is currently incomplete. Continued analysis and optimization are required to have a thorough understanding of the success or failure of the attempted design. As additive manufacturing technology evolves, the ability for it to become the primary method of fabrication for sensitive measurement systems increases. This project contributes to this by providing one method for design, a framework for optimizing existing balances for additive manufacturing, and resources for performing necessary stress analysis."

The availability of these data at the basin scale enables novel insight into the physical and biological processes in an area that has historically been difficult to gather in situ data from. The analysis shows large regional and interannual variability of these parameters but also strong coherence across the Southern Ocean. The covariability of the parameters near the marginal ice zone shows a generally negative relationship between SSS and Chlα (r = −0.87). This may in part be attributed to the large seasonality of the variables, but analysis of data within the spring period (from November to December) shows similarly high correlation (r = −0.81). This is the first time that a large-scale robust connection between low salinity and high phytoplankton concentration during ice melt period has been quantified. Chlorophyll-α concentration is also well correlated with SST (r = 0.79) providing a potential indicator of the strength of the temperature limitation on primary productivity in the region. The observed correlation also varied regionally due to differences in ice melt patterns during spring and summer. Overall, this study provides new insights into the physical characteristics of the Southern Ocean as observed from space. In a continually warming and freshening Southern Ocean, the relationships observed here provide a key data source for testing ocean biogeochemical models and assessing the effect of sea ice–ocean processes on primary production."

Two models were created, one for cases and one for deaths, utilizing a scaled Besag, York, Mollié model with Type I spatial-temporal interaction. Each model accounts for 16 social vulnerability and 7 environmental variables as fixed effects. The spatial pattern between COVID-19 cases and deaths is significantly different in many ways. The spatiotemporal trend of the pandemic in the United States illustrates a shift out of many of the major metropolitan areas into the United States Southeast and Southwest during the summer months and into the upper Midwest beginning in autumn. Analysis of the major social vulnerability predictors of COVID-19 infection and death found that counties with higher percentages of those not having a high school diploma, having non-White status and being Age 65 and over to be significant. Among the environmental variables, above ground level temperature had the strongest effect on relative risk to both cases and deaths. Hot and cold spots, areas of statistically significant high and low COVID-19 cases and deaths respectively, derived from the convolutional spatial effect show that areas with a high probability of above average relative risk have significantly higher Social Vulnerability Index composite scores. The same analysis utilizing the spatiotemporal interaction term exemplifies a more complex relationship between social vulnerability, environmental measurements, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 deaths."

In weather tracking, high-frequency temporal observations are critical and used to improve forecasts, study severe events, and extract atmospheric motion, among others. However, while the current generation of geostationary (GEO) satellites has hemispheric coverage at 10-15-min intervals, higher temporal frequency observations are ideal for studying mesoscale severe weather events. In this work, we present a novel application of deep learning-based optical flow to temporal upsampling of GEO satellite imagery. We apply this technique to 16 bands of the GOES-R/Advanced Baseline Imager mesoscale dataset to temporally enhance full-disk hemispheric snapshots of different spatial resolutions from 10 to 1 min.

The purpose of these measurements was to further evaluate efficiency factors of hot-wire total water content probes in glaciated conditions and investigate the enhancement of ice crystal concentrations near fuselage surfaces due to flow field inertial effects, and ice crystals impacting the nose, breaking up, and flowing downstream. The total water content measurements were made using either Science Engineering Associates Ice Crystal Detectors or Robust Probes. Three common sensors were mounted on an underwing canister considered to be in near free-flow conditions, a standoff from a fuselage window, and the nose of the fuselage near the pitot probes. The Ice Crystal Detector concave total water content sensor and Robust Probe sensor collection and retention efficiencies were evaluated through comparisons with the underwing Ice Crystal Detector and Robust Probe measurements to the Isokinetic Probe version 2 (IKP2), which provided the reference ice water content measurement. Local ice water content at the nose position was evaluated by comparing ratios of the nose and underwing ice crystal detectors to the IKP2. Local ice water content at the window-standoff location was also evaluated by comparing total water content sensor measurements from the window probes to the measurements made with the underwing and nose probes.

The key findings were: (1) the Ice Crystal Detector concave water content sensor efficiency factor to glaciated conditions was similar to previous estimates, but reduced with increased ice crystal median mass diameter; (2) the ice water content at the fuselage nose location near the DC-8 pitot probes was approximately 2.5 times the freestream values—although this estimate is affected by a higher probe efficiency factor due to smaller particles in the debris cloud from impacts upstream of the probe; and (3) the ice water content at the 17 in. standoff from the port window varied from about 50 percent to nearly three times freestream values in a complicated manner. Similar measurement locations are not uncommon on cloud research aircraft, where ice particle measurements may be subject to similar uncertainties."

In addition, certain parameters (e.g., specific leaf area, SLA) that have an outsized influence on vegetation model behavior can be constrained by observations of shortwave reflectance, thus reducing model predictive uncertainty. Importantly, calibrating against radiative transfer outputs allows models to directly use remote sensing reflectance products without relying on highly derived products (such as MODIS leaf area index) whose assumptions may be incompatible with the target vegetation model and whose uncertainties are usually not well quantified. Here, we created the EDR model by coupling the two-stream representation of canopy radiative transfer in the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2) with a leaf radiative transfer model (PROSPECT-5) and a simple soil reflectance model to predict full-range, high-spectral-resolution surface reflectance that is dependent on the underlying ED2 model state. We then calibrated this model against estimates of hemispherical reflectance (corrected for directional effects) from the NASA Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and survey data from 54 temperate forest plots in the northeastern United States. The calibration significantly reduced uncertainty in model parameters related to leaf biochemistry and morphology and canopy structure for five plant functional types. Using a single common set of parameters across all sites, the calibrated model was able to accurately reproduce surface reflectance for sites with highly varied forest composition and structure. However, the calibrated model's predictions of leaf area index (LAI) were less robust, capturing only 46 % of the variability in the observations. Comparing the ED2 radiative transfer model with another two-stream soil–leaf–canopy radiative transfer model commonly used in remote sensing studies (PRO4SAIL) illustrated structural errors in the ED2 representation of direct radiation backscatter that resulted in systematic underestimation of reflectance. In addition, we also highlight that, to directly compare with a two-stream radiative transfer model like EDR, we had to perform an additional processing step to convert the directional reflectance estimates of AVIRIS to hemispherical reflectance (also known as “albedo”). In future work, we recommend that vegetation models add the capability to predict directional reflectance, to allow them to more directly assimilate a wide range of airborne and satellite reflectance products. We ultimately conclude that despite these challenges, using dynamic vegetation models to predict surface reflectance is a promising avenue for model calibration and validation using remote sensing data."

These communities share underlying natural and artificial conditions that make them vulnerable to these hazards, including excessive precipitation, weak lithology, high impervious surface levels, and steep slopes. Despite the human and economic risks associated with these environmental hazards, the areas of highest vulnerability within the region remain unknown. NASA DEVELOP partnered with Groundwork USA and Groundwork Ohio River Valley (ORV) to assess the region’s susceptibility to landslides and flooding. The team utilized NASA Earth observations, including the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrieval for GPM (IMERG), alongside ancillary datasets to map landslide susceptibility and exposure throughout the study area. The team also used ancillary data to map surface runoff and runoff retention using the Natural Capital Project’s Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Urban Flood Risk Mitigation Model. The resulting landslide susceptibility and exposure maps highlight the neighborhoods around Avondale and Fairmount as areas of particularly high landslide exposure. Meanwhile, the InVEST outputs demonstrate that Downtown Cincinnati and the Queensgate neighborhood retain the least amount of rainfall. This research provides partners with a more complete hazard analysis of the greater Cincinnati area while also producing refined methodologies to enhance future flood and landslide vulnerability mapping throughout Groundwork USA’s nationwide network of communities."

Scientists at Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (JBNERR) are concerned that sea level rise will exacerbate coastal damage from these weather events. Using NASA Earth observations, our team analyzed coastal change, land use land cover change (LULC), mangrove forest extent, and water quality of Jobos Bay. Using Google Earth Engine, we evaluated coastal change and mangrove forest habitat within the study region by classifying NASA Earth observation imagery. We created historic LULC composite images to observe how land use changes over time and improve understanding of urbanization in the watershed. Leveraging previous water quality studies, our team compared water quality datasets generated by the Optical Reef and Coastal Area Assessment (ORCAA) tool to in situ sensors provided by JBNERR partners to understand the overall quality of water in the study area with respect to turbidity, chlorophyll-a, sea surface temperature, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentrations. We discovered that 17% of the reserve has shifted from land to water since 1997 and lost 4.85 square kilometers of mangrove habitat over the past decade. Results from this study will inform the scientists of JBNERR and community members of the regional impacts of sea level rise. Being the first comprehensive study done in the estuary in nearly a decade, this serves as a baseline for future conservation efforts and research in the estuary."

While agricultural impacts studies to date have focused on currently cultivated land, the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison Project (GGCMI) Phase 2 experiment allows us to assess changes in both yields and the location of peak productivity regions under warming. We examine crop responses under projected end-of-century warming using 7 process-based models simulating 5 major crops (maize, rice, soybeans, and spring and winter wheat) with a variety of adaptation strategies. We find that in no-adaptation cases, when planting date and cultivar choices are held fixed, regions of peak production remain stationary and yield losses can be severe, since growing seasons contract strongly with warming. When adaptations in management practices are allowed (cultivars that retain growing season length under warming and modified planting dates), peak productivity zones shift poleward and yield losses are largely recovered. While most growing-zone shifts are ultimately limited by geography, breadbaskets studied here move poleward over 600 km on average by end of the century under RCP8.5. These results suggest that agricultural impacts assessments can be strongly biased if restricted in spatial area or in the scope of adaptive behavior considered. Accurate evaluation of food security under climate change requires global modeling and careful treatment of adaptation strategies."

The ability to assess stock pond water levels with Earth observing satellite systems would enhance monitoring efforts of partners at the US Forest Service, Arizona Department of Game and Fish, and the Diablo Trust. This study employed Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-SAR), and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) to monitor surface water extent for hundreds of critical stock ponds in Arizona. Using methods adapted from previously developed image processing workflows, this project conducted a time-series analysis to capture seasonal and interannual variations in surface water area between 2013 to 2021. In addition, end users can monitor the surface water extent of stock ponds through the developed Google Earth Engine software tool called Surface Water Identification and Forecasting Tool (SWIFT). SWIFT incorporates the Automated Water Extraction Index, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, and Tasseled Cap-Wetness Index for optical imagery and the incidence angle, VV and VH polarization bands for Sentinel-1 imagery to detect small water bodies in the study area with an overall accuracy range of 88-93%. These tools will empower our partners to monitor the extents of water in their stock ponds remotely, enabling them to develop data-informed and sustainable management solutions for decades to come."

The concept envisions designing a compliant multilayered coatings architecture to accommodate the thermal expansion mismatch strains between the ZrC outer coating and the Gr/(U,Zr)C fuel matrix along with using a diffusion barrier to minimize carbon and hydrogen diffusion, respectively. Multilayered coatings were deposited on Gr substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Graphite disks, as well as the inner channels of a 19-hole hexagonal rod 152.4 mm long, were coated by CVD in proof-of concept process demonstration studies. Coated disk specimens were thermally-cycled between ambient and 1900 K for as long as 20 cycles with a 1h hold time at the temperature using both stepped and non-interrupted thermal cycling methods. Detailed cross-sectional microstructural analyses were conducted on the thermally-cycled coated disks. These results showed that the coatings were intact after 20 thermal cycles at 1900 K although the bonding of the overlay Mo coating appeared to be influenced by the oxygen content in the layer. Seven transverse sections were cut along the length from the coated hexagonal rod for microstructural studies. All the nineteen channels were observed to have been coated in all the sections. This paper reports the results of detailed microstructural analyses, compositional line scans and x-ray dot maps conducted on three coated channels from a mid-section of the rod. The measured values of carbon (C) were observed to be exceptionally high in all the specimens, which were attributed to hydrocarbon contamination of the specimen surfaces. It was observed that the oxygen (O) levels were high in all the coating layers even after approximately correcting for the observed high values of C. The source of O contamination of the CVD reactor system was attributed to either the presence of oxychloride impurities in the precursor salts or a pin hole leak in the coating system. It is concluded that high values of O result in poor bonding of the Mo overlay to the ZrC layer. These trials have established that it is possible to deposit multilayered coatings by CVD in 19-hole hexagonal rods 152.4 mm long similar to the NERVA fuel rod design although the quality of the coatings and the uniformity of their thicknesses require further improvement."

NASA selects university teams every year to partake in the X-HAB Academic Innovation Challenge, with this year’s number of teams being six. Air Revitalization is a crucial system for any space travel, be it for Low Earth Orbit, such as the International Space Station, or for deep space transit. Current systems, such as the Carbon Dioxide Removal Apparatus aboard the ISS, require upkeep and maintenance, which cannot be done on long distance space missions. For the past several years, NASA has done research on Cryogenic systems for Carbon Dioxide removal. These systems operate on the fact that Carbon Dioxide freezes at a higher temperature than Oxygen and Nitrogen, so Carbon Dioxide can be frozen out of the cabin atmosphere without the use of filters, which degrade over time. To cool the cabin air down to a temperature where Carbon Dioxide freezes, Stirling cryocoolers have been used, which have shown promise in the hope of Carbon Dioxide deposition for Cabin Air Revitalization. Cryogenic systems are much more reliable but require significant energy input to operate. Physical systems, such as radiators, have generally not been used for this task, as there is a need to be able to “turn off” the rejection of heat to allow the frozen carbon dioxide to be collected. However, with working fluids pumped through a physical radiator, that aspect of operation can be achieved. The goal of this challenge is to determine the effectiveness of a variable conductance thermal radiator that can reject heat to deep space, without the use of a dedicated cryocooler to remove energy from the cabin air. The proposed design uses piping, hot and cold working fluids, and non-condensable gas to absorbl heat from the cabin air on one side of the radiator and reject the heat to deep space by means of thermal radiation. As well, the system will allow for the recovery of deposited Carbon Dioxide. The UNT X-HAB 2021 team will create a model radiator and test its performance with simulated heat sources and sinks and extrapolate those data points to analyze for real world conditions."

These rapid land use changes are increasing human presence in previously sparsely populated areas, disrupting ecosystems and increasing the proximity of human settlement to zoonotic disease vectors. Dengue fever and leishmaniasis are two neglected tropical diseases which are prevalent in Madre de Dios and have been associated with urbanization and road construction. In partnership with the Peruvian Ministries of Health (MINSA) and the Environment (MINAM) and other in-country collaborators, our team examined Land Use Land Cover (LULC) correlations with reported dengue and leishmaniasis incidence in the Madre de Dios region to help partners understand the spatial relationship between land use change and zoonotic disease incidence. We created a LULC classification script using Google Earth Engine with Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager imagery to classify land cover in 2010, 2015, and 2020 and evaluate changes over this time period. We then used the quantified results of the LULC assessment in conjunction with reported disease cases to evaluate correlations between disease incidence and key land cover changes across Madre de Dios’s 11 districts. In the second term, the team will use these products to develop more detailed disease incidence risk maps and models. High risk areas will then be classified, using PeruSat-1 that allow for even higher resolution mapping at less than 3 meters. These products will allow the partners to understand hotspots of land cover change in Peru and the relationship with outbreaks to inform public health decision making and environmental policy."

NASA’s current concept of the future of lunar communication, LunaNet [1], outlines a complex network of networks. Challenges such as scalability, interoperability and reliability must first be addressed to successfully fulfill this vision. Machine intelligence can greatly reduce the reliance on human operators and enable efficient operations for tasks such as scheduling and network management. The application of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other automated decision-making techniques can be used to allow network nodes to intelligently sense and adapt to changes in the environment such as link disruptions, new nodes joining the network, and support for a diverse range of protocols. Cognitive networking seeks to evolve these technologies into an autonomous system with improved science data return, reliability, and scalability. In this paper, we study three main areas a means to further develop cognitive networking capabilities: networking and flight software development, analysis of wireless data for modeling and simulation, and development of algorithms for a multi-agent system."

This chapter outlines the types of solar array structures that have been used on U.S.-led robotic planetary science missions since the beginning of the space age, including several in development for future launch. The first solar-powered spacecraft employed body-mounted solar cells but designs quickly moved to extended panels to generate more electrical power. Early “paddle” designs were replaced by deployable twin rectangular “wings” which are still common in science missions and nearly ubiquitous in commercial telecommunications satellites. The increasing complexity of science missions investigating the nature of the space environment drove the development of the solar-powered satellites from the very beginning, and unique mission requirements to explore ever more distant and harsher regions of our solar system continue to drive innovations in spacecraft design, including solar arrays. This general progression to ever larger solar arrays to power ever more sophisticated spacecraft in ever harsher environments, punctuated by missions that emphasize lower cost and complexity, is a pattern that began in the 1960s and continues to this day. This chapter describes the solar array configurations used on deep space missions, with an emphasis on NASA’s planetary science missions, including specific design requirements that led to individual design selections.

NASA Glenn Research Center developed an active flight experiment, called the Scattered Space Atomic Oxygen Experiment (SSAOE), to characterize AO scattering erosion in space.  The SSAOE is comprised of three independent sub-experiments: A two part active experiment to measure both in-situ direct ram AO erosion and in-situ scattered AO erosion within an AO scatterometer; a passive AO scatterometer to measure the angular distribution of LEO AO scattered off an inclined angle; and passive samples for AO erosion yield (Ey) characterization.  The SSAOE was originally flown on the Wake Shield Facility (WSF) during the STS-60 shuttle mission, and was later flown as part of the MISSE 6 mission on the exterior of the ISS.  During the MISSE-6 mission the SSAOE was exposed to the space environment for 1.45 years.  This paper provides an overview of the SSAOE, information on the flight missions, post-flight photographs of the passive flight samples and results on the angular distribution of scattered LEO AO obtained from the passive AO scatterometer sub-experiment.

The effects of such stresses have been documented along most coasts around the island. However, little attention has been paid to reefs located on the north coast, and very little is known about their composition and current state. Here, we present a study characterizing riverine inputs, water quality conditions, and benthic composition of two previously undescribed coral reefs (Tómbolo and Machuca reefs) located just eastward of the Río Grande de Manatí outlet in north-central Puerto Rico. This study utilizes a time series of remotely sensed ocean color products (diffuse vertical attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [Kd490] and chlorophyll-a concentration [Chl-a] estimated with data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite [VIIRS]) to characterize water quality in this coastal region. In general, the months with relatively high mean daily river streamflow also coincide with months having the highest proportion of eastward wave direction, which can promote the eastward influence of river waters towards the two coral reefs sites. Kd490 and Chl-a showed a higher riverine influence closer to the watershed outlet. Kd490 and Chl-a monthly peaks also coincide with river streamflow highs, particularly at those pixels closer to shore. Tómbolo Reef, located farther eastward of the river outlet, shows a well-developed primary reef framework mainly composed of threatened reef-building species (Acropora palmata, Pseudodiploria) and high coral cover (19-51%). The benthos of Machuca Reef, located closer to the river outlet, is dominated by macroalgae with a significantly lower coral cover (0.2-2.7%) mainly composed of “weedy” coral species (Porites astroides, and S. radians). Cover of major benthic components correlates with distance from the river outlet, and with gradients in Kd490 and Chl-a, with higher coral cover and lower macroalgal cover farther from the river outlet. Coral cover at Tómbolo Reef is higher than what has been reported for similar sites around Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands showing its ecological importance and, as up until now, an unrecognized potential refuge of reef-building threatened coral species."

We identified materials as exogenic on the basis of an absorption near 1 μm that is indicative of anhydrous silicates. The exogenic materials are spatially resolved by the telescopic camera PolyCam. All such materials are brighter than their surroundings, and they are expressed in a variety of morphologies: homogeneous, breccia-like, inclusion-like, and others. Inclusion-like features are the most common. Visible spectrophotometry was obtained for 46 of the 77 locations from MapCam images. Principal component analysis indicates at least two trends: (i) mixing of Bennu's average spectrum with a strong 1-μm band absorption, possibly from pyroxene-rich material, and (ii) mixing with a weak 1-μm band absorption. The end member with a strong 1-μm feature is consistent with Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite (HED) meteorites, whereas the one showing a weak 1-μm feature may be consistent with HEDs, ordinary chondrites, or carbonaceous chondrites. The variation in the few available near-infrared reflectance spectra strongly suggests varying compositions among the exogenic materials. Thus, Bennu might record the remnants of multiple impacts with different compositions to its parent body, which could have happened in the very early history of the Solar system. Moreover, at least one of the exogenic objects is compositionally different from the exogenic materials found on the similar asteroid (162173) Ryugu, and they suggest different impact tracks."

The importance increases exponentially for longer duration missions, such as the upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and the “next giant leap” to Mars. If fire occurs in the spacecraft, terrestrial help for recovery may not be possible. Crew members have limited options to suppress and escape the fires and the associated vitiated atmosphere. The partial gravity conditions after landing on the Moon or Mars, as well as the high oxygen concentration proposed for the Lunar habitat, bring in additional challenges for spacecraft fire safety. To ensure safety and mission success, there is an urgent need to advance the knowledge of fire behavior in micro and partial gravity. This will also improve the understanding of how buoyancy flow plays a role in fire behavior, leading to a more complete theory of fire dynamics for Earth applications."

This paper evaluates two such methods. One of them is the Sensor Uncertainty Mitigation (SUM) method, implemented in the Detect and Avoid Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems (DAIDALUS) algorithm, a reference implementation in the DAA minimum operational performance standards. The second method is the Virtual Intruder State Aggregation (VISA), which averages multiple subsequent intruder states extrapolated to the current (most recent) time into a single ``aggregated`` intruder state. The VISA method can be used either individually as a sensor noise mitigation method in its own right, or in combination with DAIDALUS SUM. The performance of these methods is evaluated using three safety and operational suitability metrics and compared with a baseline configuration using static safety buffers. A large number of encounters representative of low-speed unmanned aircraft against non-cooperative manned aircraft, not equipped with a broadcasting transponder or ADS-B out system, are simulated and evaluated. An air-to-air radar model produces representative sensor noise for the DAA system. Results show that increasing the DAIDALUS SUM parameters for horizontal and vertical uncertainty improves the safety metric at the cost of increasing the number of actionable alerts leading to increased workload. A range of SUM parameters is recommended as suitable values for the type of operations considered for this work. VISA was found to be almost as effective as other noise mitigation methods even when it was used alone. Combining VISA with DAIDALUS SUM achieved the best performance among all investigated methods used with DAIDALUS. General trends and optimal SUM configurations were found to be nearly the same for two large and very different encounter data sets."

Here, a new disk Nickel-base superalloy is designed to take advantage of strengthening atomic-scale dynamic complexions. This local phase transformation strengthening provides the alloy with a three times improvement in creep strength over similar disk superalloys and comparable strength to a single crystal blade alloy at 760 °C. Ultra-high-resolution chemical mapping reveals that the improvement in creep strength is a result of atomic-scale η (D024) and χ (D019) formation along superlattice stacking faults. To understand these results, the energy differences between the L12 and competing D024 and D019 stacking fault structures and their dependence on composition are computed by density functional theory. This study can help guide researchers to further optimize local phase transformation strengthening mechanisms for alloy development."

The  interplanetary counterpart of the coronal mass ejection (CME) on 2020 November 29 that generated the SEP event (hereafter ICME-2) arrived at PSP (located at 0.8 au from the Sun) on 2020 December 1.  ICME-225 was preceded by the passage of an interplanetary shock at 18:35 UT on 2020 November 30 (hereafter26S2), that in turn was preceded by another ICME (i.e., ICME-1) observed in situ on 2020 November 30.  The two interesting features of this SEP event at PSP are:  First, the presence of the intervening ICME-1 affected the evolution of the.8 MeV proton intensity time profiles resulting in the observation of inverted energy spectra throughout the passage of ICME-1.  Second,  the sheath region preceding ICME-2  was  characterized  by  weak  magnetic  fields  compared  to  those  measured  immediately  after the passage of the shock S2 and during the passage of ICME-2.  Comparison with prior SEP events measured at 1 au but with similar characteristics indicates that (1) low-energy particles accelerated by S2 were excluded from propagating throughout ICME-1, and (2) the low magnetic fields measured in the sheath of ICME-2 resulted from the properties of the upstream solar wind encountered by ICME-2 that was propagated into the sheath; whereas the high energetic particle energy density in the sheath did not play a dominant role in the formation of these low magnetic fields."
3688,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210022854,2023-08-03,Comparing Theoretically Scaled Biomechanical Models,"BACKGROUND
An investigation into incorporating space suit aspects required a 50th-percentile male model which was not part of the existing dataset of models. Previously, theoretical models for 5th-percentile female and 95th-percentile male were created utilizing a scaled test subject as close as possible to the target height and weight. Scaling factors were created by taking the height ratio and applying it uniformly to the model body segments, then fine tuning to ensure the theoretical model’s height is as expected. This study was initiated to examine the existing method of isometrically scaling in OpenSim [1,2] and to create alternative methods which do not rely on an existing subject being close in height and weight to the theoretical model of interest.  Generating a theoretical biomechanical model provides additional abilities without the reliance on available OpenSim models or real subjects. Gained abilities include creating different percentile models and attaining representative anthropometry for any target height/weight, such as targeting specific crew populations or gaps within the current dataset.

METHODS AND RESULTS
This study includes 3 methods for generating the theoretical model; utilizing the modified unscaled OpenSim Full Body Rajagopal Model (FBRM) [3,4], a dataset of scaled OpenSim models, and existing scaling factors from Dumas et al. [5]. All methods use the Anthropometric Survey of US Army Personnel (ANSUR II) [6] as an input of necessary anthropometric measurements. The following measurements are retrieved from the ANSUR II collection: mass, stature, cervicale height, acromial height, axilla height, waist height, trochanterion height, lateral femoral epicondyle height, lateral malleolus height, acromion-radiale length, radiale-stylion length, palm length, ball of foot length, bicristal breadth, bimalleolar breadth. Some of the measurements are direct segment lengths and others are utilized to derive segment lengths. Height, weight, and age ranges are the required inputs to parse the collection for a mean value of the measurements. A simple iterative process may be necessary for the output of mean mass and stature consistent with the theoretical model of interest. In some cases, one may specify exact values instead of a range but that is dependent upon whether those exact values pertain to a single subject from the ANSUR II collection. 

Equations from Dumas et al. were used to calculate scaling factors for the two methods that utilize OpenSim scaled and unscaled models. In the third method, Dumas’ scaling factors were used directly instead of generating our own. After scaling factors are achieved, they are applied along with the mass and segment lengths retrieved from ANSUR II in order to calculate the segment mass, Center of Mass (CoM), mass Moment of Inertia (MoI), and the joint location in the parent frame. The theoretical models from the different methods were compared to the previous existing method of isometrically scaling in OpenSim, as well as the standards found in NASA STD-3000 [7] and the NASA Human Integration Design Handbook [8]. The whole-body center of mass is the main comparison performed between the models and the standards. The body segment mass properties were also compared when possible. In some cases, the standards do not provide complete data, or the center of mass location is not provided with respect to the appropriate joint coordinate system. 

For a 50th-percentile male subject, results from isometric scaling in OpenSim and the method utilizing the unscaled FBRM were compared to the standards in NASA STD-3000. According to the standard, the whole-body vertical CoM location was taken from the head vertex to the CoM. The standards provide 80.2 cm for the CoM vertical component whereas isometric scaling in OpenSim and utilizing the unscaled FBRM provide 82.2 and 82.3 cm, respectively. Through definition, the whole-body CoM in the medial/lateral direction agreed across the models. Investigation is on-going to clearly identify the reference point pertaining to dorsal/ventral whole-body CoM position in standards and relate that to the theoretical models.

(known as the “Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity”, or “ECS”) is a crucial problem across model generations. This work examines the influence of the models’ present-day atmospheric circulation climatologies, and the accompanying climatological cloud radiative effects, in explaining that spread. We analyze the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models and _nd that they simulate a more poleward, and thus more realistic, edge of the Hadley Circulation (HC) in the SouthernHemisphere than the CMIP5 models, although the climatological shortwave cloud radiative effects are similar in the two generations of models. A few CMIP5 models with extreme equatorward biases in the HC edge exhibited high ECS due to strong Southern midlatitude shortwave cloud radiative warming in response to climate change, suggesting an ECS dependence on HC position. We find that such constraint no longer holds for the CMIP6 models, due to absence of models with extreme HC climatologies. In spite of this, however, the CMIP6 models show an increased spread in ECS, with more models in the high ECS range. Additionally, an improved representation of the climatological jet dynamics does not lead to a new emergent constraint in the CMIP6 models either."

To date, over fifty NASA balloon missions flown from Antarctica have carried scientific payloads from Astrophysics (APD) and Heliophysics (HPD)in SMD. Only two life science experiments have been flown from Antarctica, and both were ride-along (piggyback) opportunities, limiting the sophistication and types of model organisms that can be incorporated into studies. Herein, we argue for establishing a large, dedicated Antarctic balloon mission for the Biological and Physical Sciences (BPS) Division in SMD to be launched in 2029/2030, with an “omnibus” gondola carrying dozens of independent Space Biology payloads that would receive a sustained exposure to low dose rate GCRs for 30+ days. Our unprecedented, protracted radiation experiment cannot be done using ground-based simulation facilities or in space; it can only be achieved through an Antarctic balloon mission dedicated to BPS Division payloads. By providing more access to radiation research platforms through existing NASA SMD access to Antarctic balloon flight opportunities, the Space Biology community will be better positioned to address unknowns associated with low dose rate GCR exposures in long duration spaceflight."

Following major decreases in Antarctic sea ice since 2015, the 42-year 1979-2020 satellite dataset now shows losses in sea ice coverage in both hemispheres, and this is convincingly demonstrated by the enumeration of monthly and yearly record high and record low sea ice extents experienced over the course of the 42 years. In fact, one of the most convincing statistics on the declining Arctic sea ice cover is the fact that since 1986 the Arctic has not experienced a single monthly record high sea ice extent in any month but has experienced 93 monthly record lows. In contrast, all 12 calendar months have their 42-year Antarctic monthly record high sea ice extents in the period 2007-2015, while 8 of the 12 calendar months have had Antarctic record lows since 2015. Globally, every calendar month has registered a new monthly record low within the past 5 years. These results are complemented (and somewhat tempered) by quantification of the range of monthly and yearly sea ice extent values over the 42 years. For instance, although the Arctic’s lowest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 2012) is 53% lower than its highest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 1980), the other months have far smaller percent differences between their lowest and highest Arctic values. For yearly average sea ice
extents, the Arctic’s lowest value (in 2020) is 18% lower than its highest value (in 1982), the Antarctic’s lowest value (in 2017) is 16% lower than its highest value (in 2014), and the global lowest value (in 2019) is only 12% lower than its highest value (in 1982)."

Round-trip Mars mission scenarios last 3 years, demanding food with a shelf-life of 5 years; this means that feeding human crew sustainably for long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) will ultimately lead to a paradigm shift away from the current Earth-based food production system, which depends upon storing and transporting prepackaged foods, and toward bio-regenerative production of food in space. Pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements face similar challenges. Moreover, the methods we currently use to detect dangerous microbes in food require sample return to Earth, a situation not viable for deep-space missions. While the science behind generating foods and bioproducts is covered by other white papers, in this paper we discuss a crucial gap uniting all of them: how to ensure that such products are free of unwanted microbial contamination and safe for crew to consume. Because Earth-based food safety systems cannot be directly applied in space, safety assurance is currently a critical bottleneck in the space production of food and other bioproducts. Future sustainable deep-space missions will require NASA to devote more resources in the coming decade to understanding the biological and physical science principles underlying microbial food safety in space, and to developing efficient, reliable methods in this area."

sinking particles that transport carbon into the ocean's interior, their contribution to carbon 
export, and their attenuation with depth. Sinking particles collected in sediment trap gel layers 
from four distinct ocean ecosystems were imaged, measured, and classified. The size and identity 
of particles was used to model their contribution to particulate organic carbon (POC) flux. 
Measured POC fluxes were reasonably predicted by particle images. Nine particle types were 
identified, and most of the compositional variability was driven by the relative contribution of 
aggregates, long cylindrical fecal pellets, and salp fecal pellets. While particle composition 
varied across locations and seasons, the entire range of compositions was measured at a single 
well-observed location in the subarctic North Pacific over one month, across 500 m of depth. 
The magnitude of POC flux was not consistently associated with a dominant particle class, but 
particle classes did influence flux attenuation. Long fecal pellets attenuated most rapidly with 
depth whereas certain other classes attenuated little or not at all with depth. Small particles (<100 
m) consistently contributed ~5% to total POC flux in samples with higher magnitude fluxes. 
The relative importance of these small particle classes (spherical mini pellets, short oval fecal 
pellets, and dense detritus) increased in low flux environments (up to 46% of total POC flux). 
Imaging approaches that resolve large variations in particle composition across ocean basins, 
depth, and time will help to better parameterize biological carbon pump models"

The two events are named GW200105_162426 and GW200115_042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second by all three LIGO-Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses 8.9(exp +1.2/-1.5) M⨀ and 1.9(exp +0.3/-0.2) M⨀, whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses 5.7(exp +1.8/-2.1) M⨀ and 1.5(exp +0.7/-0.3) M⨀ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The probability that the secondary's mass is below the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89%-96% and 87%-98%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity distances are 280(exp +110/-110) Mpc and 300(+150/-100) Mpc, respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at 88% probability. We are unable to constrain the spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component for either event. We infer an NSBH merger rate density of 45(exp +75/-33) Gpc(exp -3) yr(exp -1) when assuming that GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population, or 130(+112/-69) Gpc(exp -3) yr(exp -1) under the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses."

Several numerical studies of the boundary-layer instabilities over these configurations have been reported in the recent literature, including our previous studies of the modal instability characteristics of boundary-layer streaks adjacent to the minor-axis symmetry plane of the BOLT configuration and the wake instabilities behind a diamond planform (“pizza-box”) trip along the symmetry plane on the secondary side of the BOLT-II configuration. The present work extends the latter study to a scaled version of the same
trip that is located in the region of nonzero crossflow in the vicinity of the leading edge at X/L = 0.5. Collectively, the trips along the symmetry plane and near the leading edge are the focus of the NASA roughness experiment on the secondary side of the BOLT-II configuration. The laminar basic state computation at the nominal flight design condition of Re<sub>∞</sub> = 5.44 x 10<sup>6</sup>/m and Re<sub>∞</sub> = 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup>/m shows that the leading-edge trip with k/δ ≈ 0.70 and planform-side-length-to-height ratio of b/k = 3.0 induces multiple asymmetric, longitudinal streaks within the trip wake. The most prominent streak among these resembles a finite amplitude crossflow vortex, and it supports the amplification of multiple families of unstable modes. The application of multi-dimensional instability analysis to the wake flow reveals that the most amplified unstable mode can achieve a peak N-factor of up to 20 by X/L = 0.80, indicating that the onset of transition is more than likely to occur within eighty percent of the model length. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the first analysis including nonparallel and curvature effects on hypersonic tripwake instabilities in the presence of boundary-layer crossflow over a three-dimensional configuration."

This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of aerosol properties in the near-low-cloud environment and quantitatively compares them with aerosols far from clouds, according to remote sensing observations. It interprets observations of aerosol properties from different sensors using satellite, aircraft, and ground-based observations. The correlation (and anticorrelation) between proximity to cloud and aerosol properties is discussed. Retrieval artifacts in the near-cloud environment are demonstrated and quantified for different sensor attributes and environmental conditions. Finally, the paper describes the possible corrections for near-cloud enhancement in remote sensing retrievals. This study is timely in view of science definition studies for NASA’s Aerosol, Cloud, Convection and Precipitation (ACCP) mission, which will also seek to directly link aerosol properties to nearby clouds."

Towards mitigating the impacts of forest fires, it is critical that accurate and updated information regarding not only the fire line, but also nearby human settlements, vegetation, and water sources is reported quickly to emergency services. However, while existing UAS-based fire detection methods are effective, they largely do not report the contextual environmental information necessary to best serve nearby communities in disaster response. Additionally, modern advancements in deep learning offer new approaches for image segmentation which may improve classification accuracy beyond current pixel-wise indices. In this work, we benchmark the performance of these modern segmentation techniques in locating both fire lines and environmental features in historical Autonomous Modular Sensor imagery. Furthermore, we augment these outputs with satellite imagery segmentation towards developing a robust contextual mapping tool for rapid emergency fire response and decision making."

The energy used by the plasma system would be imparted into the H2 gas, forming highly energetic ions, electrons, and neutrals that would interact with the regolith surface. The energized atomic and ionic H2 provide the energy needed to make reduction of SiO2 (Silicon Dioxide) and other regolith mineral oxides favorable. What’s more, the high-energy plasma interaction occurs in a small, localized volume, and thus requires relatively little energy. The lunar regolith is well-suited for the process as the fine particles naturally available provide a high surface area for the plasma to interact with. The process would require a system to collect the regolith composed of metal oxides (MxOy) and load it into a reactor. An H2 plasma would pass over the surface (potentially at a low pressure, reducing complexity of the system as it would not require large increases in pressure from the lunar vacuum), then the gases from the plasma reaction would be collected and processed, and the spent regolith would be carried away. The gross reaction temperature would be near ambient (due to the localized nature of the plasma), eliminating the necessity of a regolith heating mechanism or handling of molten regolith. Also, the H2 used in the plasma could be subsequently recovered from the water produced by the plasma reaction. Thus, this approach would not require significant amounts of added commodities."

This manuscript lays the groundwork into the feasibility of low-pressure solid-to-gas conversion, reaction chemistry of the by-product gases, and power consumption. The results have shown the possibility of gasification at reduced pressures without the consumable use of a feedstock carrier gas in previous studies. Thus far, the percent gasification averaged around 36% in pre-pellet trials, with the system being far from optimized. The products include H2, CO2, CO, C2H4, and C2H6. Hydrogen production was higher as expected in a CO2-like environment once the gasification process begins. The energy required to generate the plasma was on the order of that previously reported at atmospheric pressures. The ability to eliminate the need for any consumables that were required in previous iterations greatly improves the cost and operational logistics of plasma gasification equipment. Although further development of the system is needed for increased gasification percentages, elimination of useable commodities greatly favors such a system for trash management beyond low Earth orbit."

This process can give us a competing way to separate sodium from potassium to allow tandem production of acids, bases, and plant fertilizers to run upstream operations and hydroponic systems respectively (when combined with electrodialysis). If we can recover valuable chemicals from brine, then this will decrease resupply from earth, which will allow tremendous (multiple kilograms a day up-mass reduction) cost savings. In addition, using electrostatics for regolith enrichment allow much reduced mining costs for metal production on celestial bodies and allow a smaller mining footprint."

Based on long-term multiinstrument observations from the Cassini spacecraft, we provide here the first observational study of Titan's global radiant energy budget and its seasonal variations. Our results show that Titan's radiant energy budget is not balanced over the Cassini era (2004–2017) with the absorbed solar energy (1.208 ± 0.008) × 10^(23) J larger than the emitted thermal energy (1.174 ± 0.005) × 10^(23) J. The energy imbalance is 2.9 ± 0.8% of the emitted thermal energy. Titan's global radiant energy budget is not balanced either at the timescales of Earth's years and Titan's seasons. In particular, the energy imbalance can be beyond 10% of the emitted thermal energy at the timescale of an Earth year. The energy imbalance revealed in this study has important impacts on Titan, which should be examined further by theories and models."

Based on this research effort along with considerations of the maturing concept for UAM airspace integration, a cognitive walkthrough exercise and a human-in-the-loop simulation were conducted with controller subject matter experts (SMEs) to evaluate Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) current day helicopter routes for near-term use as UAM routes. One of the outcomes of this work is a set of heuristics that should be applied when designing UAM routes in the future. The following heuristics were identified as critical to UAM route design: the proximity of routes to surrounding airports (including approach and departure paths of traditional commercial traffic), the configuration of surrounding airports, avoiding congested or heavily populated areas, avoiding route segments that would go through several sectors, avoiding route segments that would go in and out of Class B airspace, creating routes outside of Class B airspace when able, using routes with two-way, altitude-separated traffic when able, minimizing the length of the route, avoiding commonly placed Temporary Flight Restrictions, and creating Non-Movement Areas or UNICOM Areas. This paper describes each of these identified heuristics and relevant examples based on a human-in-the-loop study conducted using the DFW area airspace."

Unusual Jet Dynamics in the IceCube Candidate PKS 1502+106,"On 2019/07/30.86853 UT, IceCube detected a high-energy astrophysical neutrino can-didate. The Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar PKS 1502+106 is located within the 50 percent uncertainty region of the event. Our analysis of 15 GHz Very Long Baseline Ar-ray (VLBA) and astrometric 8 GHz VLBA data, in a time span prior and after theIceCube event, reveals evidence for a radio ring structure which develops with time.Several arc-structures evolve perpendicular to the jet ridge line. We find evidence forprecession of  a  curved  jet based  on kinematic  modelling  and a  periodicity  analysis.An outflowing broad line region (BLR) based on the C IV line emission (Sloan Dig-ital Sky Survey, SDSS) is found. We attribute the atypical ring to an interaction ofthe precessing jet with the outflowing material.We discuss our findings in thecontext of a spine-sheath scenario where the ring reveals the sheath andits interaction with the surroundings (NLR clouds).We find that the radioemission is correlated with theγ-ray emission, with radio lagging theγ-rays. Basedon theγ-ray variability timescale, we constrain theγ-ray emission zone to the BLR(30-200rg) and within the jet launching region. We discuss that the outflowing BLRprovides the external radiation field forγ-ray production via external Compton scat-tering.The neutrino is most likely produced by proton-proton interactionin the blazar zone (beyond the BLR), enabled by episodic encounters ofthe jet with dense clouds, i.e. some molecular cloud in the NLR."

one Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) station in Svalbard. The goal was to capture the
seasonal vertical displacements caused by elastic response of variable mass load due to ice and
snow accumulation. We found that estimates of the annual signal in different GNSS solutions
disagree by more than 3 mm which makes geophysical interpretation of raw GNSS time series
problematic. To overcome this problem, we have used an enhanced Common Mode (CM) filtering
technique. The time series are differentiated by the time series from remote station BJOS
with known mass loading signals removed a priori. Using this technique, we have achieved a
substantial reduction of the differences between the GNSS solutions. We have computed mass
loading time series from a regional Climatic Mass Balance (CMB) and snow model that provides
the amount of water equivalent at a 1 km resolution with a time step of 7 days. We found
that the entire vertical loading signal is present in data of two totally independent techniques
at a statistically significant level of 95%. This allowed us to conclude that the remaining errors
in vertical signal derived from the CMB model are less than 0.2 mm at that significance
level. Refining the land water storage loading model with a CMB model resulted in a reduction
of the annual amplitude from 2:1 mm to 1:1 mm in the CM filtered time series, while it had
only a marginal impact on raw time series. This provides a strong evidence that CM filtering is
essential for revealing local periodic signals when a millimetre level of accuracy is required."

Of  particular  concern  are  compoundevents, i.e., when conditions are extreme for multiple potential ocean ecosystem stressors such as temperature and chlorophyll.Yet, little is known about the occurrence, intensity and duration of such compound high temperature (aka marine heatwaves -MHWs) and low chlorophyll (LChl) extreme events, whether their distributions have changed in the past decades and what thepotential drivers are. Here we use satellite-based sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration estimates to provide a5first assessment of such compound extreme events. We reveal hotspots of compound MHW and LChl events in the equatorialPacific, along the boundaries of the subtropical gyres, in the northern Indian Ocean, and around Antarctica. In these regions,compound events that typically last one week occur three to seven times more often than expected under the assumption ofindependence  between  MHWs  and  LChl  events.  The  occurrence  of  compound  MHW  and  LChl  events  varies  on  seasonalto interannual timescales. At the seasonal timescale, most compound events occur in summer in both hemispheres. At the10interannual timescale, the frequency of compound MHW and LChl events is strongly modulated by large-scale modes of naturalclimate variability such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, whose positive phase is associated with increased compoundevent occurrence in the eastern equatorial Pacific and in the Indian Ocean by a factor of up to four. Our results provide a firstunderstanding of where, when and why compound MHW and LChl events occur. Further studies are needed to identify theexact physical and biological drivers of these potentially harmful events in the ocean and their evolution under global warming."

The next step was to finalize on-board, localized image libraries and site-specific terrain information prior to attempting sample acquisition. Collecting this information required additional, low-altitude asteroid flyby reconnaissance activities. These activities, referred to as ‘sorties’, involved special maneuver and trajectory designs, unique from any other OSIRIS-REx maneuver activity. In order to minimize time between flybys and decrease the total number of maneuvers required, this trajectory design departed from and returned to a frozen Sun-terminator plane orbit within the span of a few hours. This work discusses the trajectory design and performance of the four flybys that were used to collect key topographic science observations of the primary and backup sample sites, which helped lead to a successful sample collection."

We identify five pairs of solutions, in which the anomalies are explained by adding an extra lens or source component in addition to the base binary-lens model. We resolve the degeneracies by applying a method in which the measured flux ratio between the first and second source stars is compared with the flux ratio deduced from the ratio of the source radii. Applying this method leaves a single pair of viable solutions, in both of which the major anomaly is generated by a planetary-mass third body of the lens, and the minor anomaly is generated by a faint second source. A Bayesian analysis indicates that the lens comprises three masses: a planet-mass object with ∼2.6 MJ and binary stars of K and M dwarfs lying in the galactic disk. We point out the possibility that the lens is the blend, and this can be verified by conducting high-resolution follow-up imaging for the resolution of the lens from the source."

Many circumbinary simulations also require the use of numerical mass sinks: source terms that prevent gas from unphysically accumulating around the simulated point masses by removing gas at a given rate. However, special care must be taken when drawing physical conclusions from such simulations to ensure that results are not biased by numerical artifacts. We demonstrate how improved sink methods reduce some of these biases, using simulations of aspect ratio 0.1 accretion disks around binaries with mass ratios between 0.1 and 1. We show that sink terms that do not reduce the angular momentum of gas relative to the accreting object (1) reduce the dependence on the sink rate of quantities such as the torque on the binary, distribution of accretion between binary components, and evolution of the binary semimajor axis; (2) reduce the degree to which the sink rate affects the structure of the accretion disks around each binary component; (3) alter the variability of accretion onto the binary, regularizing it in time. We also investigate other potential sources of systematic error, such as gravitational softening and simplifications to the viscous stress tensor. Because of the strong dependence of binary orbital evolution on both the torque and the distribution of mass between binary components, the sink method influences the orbital evolution of the binary at all mass ratios, with mass ratios below ∼0.3 most affected."

Lower-frequency radar sounders are often deployed to mitigate these effects, but the lack of a global synthesis of their success limits progress in system and survey design. Here we extend a recent global compilation of glacier thickness measurements (GlaThiDa) with the center frequency for radar-sounding surveys. From a maximum reported thickness of ∼ 1500 m near 1 MHz, the maximum thickness sounded decreases by ∼ 500 m per frequency decade. Between 25–100 MHz, newer airborne radar sounders generally outperform older, ground-based ones. Based on globally modeled glacier thicknesses, we conclude that a multi-element, ≤30 MHz airborne radar sounder could survey most temperate glaciers more efficiently."

However, it remains unclear whether GrIS darkening is due to snow grain size increases, higher concentrations of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs), or a combination. Here, we assess albedo controls in the western GrIS percolation zone using in situ albedo, LAI, and grain size measurements. We find a significant correlation between albedo and snow grain size (p < 0.01), but not with LAIs. Modeling corroborates that LAI concentrations are too low to significantly reduce albedo, but larger grain sizes could reduce albedo by at least ∼3%. Strong atmospheric blocking increases grain sizes and reduces albedo through increased surface temperature, fewer storms, and higher incoming shortwave radiation. These findings clarify the mechanisms by which anomalously strong blocking contributed to recent GrIS albedo decline and mass loss, highlighting the importance of improving projections of future blocking."

Due to a history of heavy industrialization, residents of southeast Michigan and northern Ohio are especially susceptible to ground-level ozone. NASA DEVELOP, in partnership with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy’s (EGLE) Air Quality Division and the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO), investigated the effectiveness of Earth observations (EO) in monitoring pollutants that contribute to ground-level ozone. The team used the European Space Agency’s TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard Sentinel-5P, and NASA’s Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard Aura, to measure nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and methane (CH4) from 2019 to 2021 (May-September). The team oversampled the EO data on monthly, yearly, and 3-year time scales where possible to enhance more localized pollutant trends. Specifically, TROPOMI effectively monitored NO2 from space, indicating sub-city distributions on a monthly timescale. Contrastingly, the measurements of HCHO were predominately noisy, and therefore failed to show any distribution trends. Lastly, CH4 trends were identifiable yet coarse, hinting that EO monitoring in the case of CH4 is not beneficial for our partners. The end products provide the partners with insight on the utility of EO in measuring certain ozone precursors and can be used to guide ground-level ozone reduction strategies throughout the region."

Our knowledge of the structure of the atmosphere is largely derived from atmospheric satellite measurements. Yet tenuous layers can be hard to detect in satellite lidar data, especially in daylight data characterized by high solar background. In this study, we introduce an approach to detect tenuous atmospheric layers in the atmospheric lidar measurements of NASA's ICESat-2. The density-dimension algorithm for ICESat-2 atmospheric data (DDA-atmos) identifies atmospheric layers while automatically adapting to different background conditions of night, twilight, and daylight data. This capability, demonstrated for tenuous clouds and blowing snow, offers a data-based solution to an important climate modeling problem. Atmospheric layer boundaries, detection confidence, and density fields resultant from the DDA-atmos are reported in ICESat-2 atmospheric data product ATL09."

This research initiative is divided into two activities, collectively having three goals: (i) to define the current state of the science with respect to representations of wet and especially dry deposition in regional models, (ii) to quantify the extent to which different dry deposition parameterizations influence retrospective air pollutant concentration and flux predictions, and (iii) to identify, through the use of a common set of detailed diagnostics, sensitivity simulations, model evaluation, and reduction of input uncertainty, the specific causes for the current range of these predictions. Activity 1 is dedicated to the diagnostic evaluation of wet and dry deposition processes in regional air quality models (described in this paper), and Activity 2 to the evaluation of dry deposition point models against ozone flux measurements at multiple towers with multiyear observations (to be described in future submissions as part of the special issue on AQMEII4). The scope of this paper is to present the scientific protocols for Activity 1, as well as to summarize the technical information associated with the different dry deposition approaches used by the participating research groups of AQMEII4. In addition to describing all common aspects and data used for this multi-model evaluation activity, most importantly, we present the strategy devised to allow a common process-level comparison of dry deposition obtained from models using sometimes very different dry deposition schemes. The strategy is based on adding detailed diagnostics to the algorithms used in the dry deposition modules of existing regional air quality models, in particular archiving diagnostics specific to land use–land cover (LULC) and creating standardized LULC categories to facilitate cross-comparison of LULC-specific dry deposition parameters and processes, as well as archiving effective conductance and effective flux as means for comparing the relative influence of different pathways towards the net or total dry deposition. This new approach, along with an analysis of precipitation and wet deposition fields, will provide an unprecedented process-oriented comparison of deposition in regional air quality models. Examples of how specific dry deposition schemes used in participating models have been reduced to the common set of comparable diagnostics defined for AQMEII4 are also presented."

However, evidence for the quadrupolar Hellings & Downs interpulsar correlations, which are characteristic of gravitational-wave signals, was not yet significant. We emulate and extend the NANOGrav data set, injecting a wide range of stochastic gravitational-wave background(GWB)signals that encompass a variety of amplitudes and spectral shapes, and quantify three key milestones.(I)Given the amplitude measured in the 12.5 yr analysis and assuming this signal is a GWB, we expect to accumulate robust evidence of an interpulsar-correlated GWB signal with 15–17 yr of data, i.e., an additional 2–5 yr from the 12.5 yr data set.(II)At the initial detection, we expect a fractional uncertainty of 40% on the power-law strain spectrum slope, which is sufficient to distinguish a GWB of supermassive black hole binary origin from some models predicting more exotic origins.(III)Similarly, the measured GWB amplitude will have an uncertainty of 44% upon initial detection, allowing us to arbitrate between some population models of supermassive black hole binaries. In addition, power-law models are distinguishable from those having low-frequency spectral turnovers once 20 yr of data are reached. Even though our study is based on the NANOGrav data, we also derive relations that allow for a generalization to other pulsar timing array data sets. Most notably, by combining the data of individual arrays into the International Pulsar Timing Array, all of these milestones can be reached significantly earlier."

Dynamic spectra for the observing epochs of each pulsar were used to obtain estimates of scintillation timescales, scintillation bandwidths, and the corresponding scattering delays using a stretching algorithm to account for frequency-dependent scaling. We were able to measure scintillation bandwidths for 28 pulsars at1500 MHz and 15 pulsars at 820 MHz. We examine scaling behavior for 17 pulsars and find power-law indices ranging from−0.7 to−3.6, though these may be biased shallow due to insufficient frequency resolution at lower frequencies. We were also able to measure scintillation timescales for six pulsars at 1500 MHz and seven pulsars at820 MHz. There is fair agreement between our scattering delay measurements and electron-density model predictions for most pulsars. We derive interstellar scattering-based transverse velocities assuming isotropic scattering and a scattering screen halfway between the pulsar and Earth. We also estimate the location of the scattering screens assuming proper motion and interstellar scattering-derived transverse velocities are equal. We find no correlations between variations in scattering delay and either variations in dispersion measure or flux density. For most pulsars for which scattering delays are measurable, we find that time-of-arrival uncertainties for a given epoch are larger than our scattering delay measurements, indicating that variable scattering delays are currently subdominant in our overall noise budget but are important for achieving precisions of tens of nanoseconds or less."

It also gives a short overview of the research on tides at the LTI through the years. Summaries are given of the 26 papers in the special issue. It will be seen that the topics of many of them could be thought of as providing a continuation of the research first undertaken at the LTI. Altogether, they provide an interesting snapshot of work on tides now being made by groups around the world."

Field surveys, which the national government of Bhutan has relied on to monitor remote agricultural lands, are becoming increasingly overwhelmed by growing threats to agricultural health. To address these concerns, NASA DEVELOP partnered with the Department of Agriculture of Bhutan, the Bhutan Foundation, and the Ugyen Wangchuck Institute of Conservation and Environmental Research (UWICER) and worked to increase the government of Bhutan’s agricultural monitoring capacity. Utilizing Earth observations including Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-SAR), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Planet imagery, the DEVELOP team worked with NASA SERVIR and created a sampling protocol to identify rice plantations and supplement field surveys for more efficient agriculture monitoring. The analysis focused on districts Paro, Punakha, Samtse, Sarpang, Trongsa, Zhemgang, Wangdue Phodrang, and Samdrup Jongkhar in the year 2020 during the period of transplantation (June) to harvesting of rice (November). The team provided the partners with a sampling protocol for integrating NASA Earth observations into their crop monitoring methods, as well as a crop mask for rice identification and to aid crop management. The crop mask for rice was developed using the Random Forest (RF) classifier for the eight districts of Bhutan. Visually, the random forest model has proved to be more accurate and precise than the classification and Regression Tree model. Statistically, the Random Forest model was 91.8% accurate in identifying rice in Bhutan."

Water quality parameters also are estimated from model outputs and remote sensing. The integration of these data, via data assimilation, can result in a more holistic characterization of these highly dynamic ecosystems, and consequently improve water resource management. It is becoming common to see combinations of these data applied to answer relevant scientific questions. Yet, methods for scaling water quality data across regions and beyond, to provide actionable knowledge for stakeholders, have emerged only recently, particularly with the availability of satellite data now providing global coverage at high spatial resolution. In this paper, data sources and existing data integration frameworks are reviewed to give an overview of the present status and identify the gaps in existing frameworks. We propose an integration framework to provide information to user communities through the the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch Initiative. This aims to develop and build the global capacity and utility of water quality data, products, and information to support equitable and inclusive access for water resource management, policy and decision making."

In this study, we explore the combination of ground-based active and passive remote sensors deployed for thermodynamic profiling to analyze various boundary-layer observation strategies. Optimal-estimation retrievals of thermodynamic profiles from Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI) observed spectral radiance are compared with and without the addition of active sensor observations from a May–June 2017 observation period at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement–Southern Great Plains Site. In all, three separate thermodynamic retrievals are considered here: retrievals including AERI data only, retrievals including AERI data and Vaisala water vapour differential absorption lidar data, and retrievals including AERI data and Raman lidar data. First, the three retrievals are compared to each other and to reference radiosonde data over the full observation period to get a bulk understanding of their differences and characterize the impact of clouds on these retrieved profiles. These analyses show that the most significant differences are in the water vapour field, where the active sensors are better able to represent the moisture gradient in the entrainment zone near boundary layer top. We also explore how differences in retrievals may impact results of applied analyses including land–atmosphere coupling, convection indices, and severe storm environmental characterization. Overall, adding active sensors to the optimal-estimation retrieval showed some added information, particularly in the moisture field. Given the costs of such platforms, the value of that added information must be weighed for the application at hand."

In this update, HF Designworks again looks to UAS test sites, manufacturers, vendors, and users to identify the latest sensor technologies covering not just GBDAA, but additional UAS sensor types; including airborne. For this latest report, the following sensor types were reviewed, as well as a few that don’t quite fit within the following categories: Electro-Optical / Infrared (EO/IR), LiDAR, RADAR, Radiofrequency (RF) scanner, Acoustic, and Other. From our interviews and research with various organizations and individuals, we found both interesting new technologies as well as improvements to many technologies first reviewed in 2018. Compared with our 2018 findings, many of the new technologies have helped produce sensors that are smaller, lighter, require less power, and have better range and resolution than those discussed in 2018. However, challenges still exist. There is no single currently available and FAA approved sensor suite that can adequately provide complete detect and avoid capabilities to meet the needs of UAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) in the civilian airspace."

This is even more critical in the context of early warning systems and especially in cases of extreme precipitation regimes in post-seismic conditions, where the rock masses are already damaged due to the ground shaking. Here, we investigate this concept by accounting for the legacy of seismic ground shaking in rainfall-induced landslide (RFIL) scenarios. We do this to identify whether ground shaking plays a role in the susceptibility to post-seismic rainfall-induced landslides and to identify whether this legacy effect persists through time. With this motivation, we use binary logistic regression and examine time series of landslides associated with four earthquakes occurred in Indonesia: 2012 Sulawesi (M(sub w) = 6.3), 2016 Reuleut (M(sub w) = 6.5), 2017 Kasiguncu (M(sub w) = 6.6) and 2018 Palu (M(sub w) = 7.5) earthquakes. The dataset includes one co-seismic and three post-seismic landslide inventories for each earthquake. We use the peak ground acceleration map of the last strongest earthquake in each case as a predisposing factor of landslides representing the effect of ground shaking. We observe that, at least for the study areas under consideration and in a probabilistic context, the earthquake legacy contributes to increase the post-seismic RFIL susceptibility. This positive contribution decays through time. Specifically, we observe that ground motion is a significant predisposing factor controlling the spatial distribution of RFIL in the post-seismic period 110 days after an earthquake. We also show that this effect dissipates within 3 years at most."

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the transiting super-Earth planet orbiting LHS 1478 (TOI-1640). The star is an inactive red dwarf (J∼9.6mag and spectral type m3 V) with mass and radius estimates of 0.20±0.01 M and 0.25±0.01R, respectively, and an effective temperature of 3381±54K. It was observed by TESS in four sectors. These data revealed a transit-like feature with a period of 1.949 days. We combined the TESS data with three ground-based transit measurements, 57 radial velocity (RV) measurements from CARMENES, and 13 RV measurements from IRD, determining that the signal is produced by a planet with a mass of 2.33+0.20−0.20M and a radius of 1.24+0.05−0.05R. The resulting bulk density of this planet is 6.67 g cm−3, which is consistent with a rocky planet with an Fe- and MgSiO3-dominated composition. Although the planet would be too hot to sustain liquid water on its surface (its equilibrium temperature is about ∼595 K, suggesting a Venus-like atmosphere), spectroscopic metrics based on the capabilities of the forthcomingJames WebbSpace Telescope and the fact that the host star is rather inactive indicate that this is one of the most favorable known rocky exoplanets for atmospheric characterization."

This is a difficult problem for the passive microwave constellation, as the signal over radiometrically warm land surfaces in the microwave frequencies means that the measurements used are indirect and typically require inferring some type of relationship between an observed scattering signal and precipitation at the surface. GPM, with collocated radiometer and dual-frequency radar, is an excellent tool for tackling this problem and improving global retrievals. 

In the years following the launch of the GPM Core Observatory satellite, physically based passive microwave retrieval of precipitation over land continues to be challenging. Validation efforts suggest that the operational GPM passive microwave algorithm, the Goddard profiling algorithm (GPROF), tends to overestimate precipitation at the low (<5 mm h−1) end of the distribution over land. In this work, retrieval sensitivities to dynamic surface conditions are explored through enhancement of the algorithm with dynamic, retrieved information from a GPM-derived optimal estimation scheme. The retrieved parameters describing surface and background characteristics replace current static or ancillary GPROF information including emissivity, water vapor, and snow cover. Results show that adding this information decreases probability of false detection by 50% and, most importantly, the enhancements with retrieved parameters move the retrieval away from dependence on ancillary datasets and lead to improved physical consistency."

The spacecraft has achieved sub-arcsecond pointing stability and millikelvin thermal stability over 20-minute observations. A key enabling feature of the ASTERIA mission is the low level of pointing error that has been demonstrated under ASTERIA’s fine pointing control mode. Prior to launch, the ASTERIA mission performed analysis and simulations to estimate the in-flight pointing performance. This analysis used reaction wheel models provided by JPL’s Small Satellite Dynamics Testbed (SSDT), which had performed Kistler table testing to characterize the jitter caused by the reaction wheels of the Blue Canyon Technologies XACT attitude control unit within ASTERIA. These models were subsequently incorporated into the SSDT simulation. The main source of jitter, the high-frequency attitude disturbance over the camera exposure time, on ASTERIA is the set of rotating reaction wheels that are used for maintaining fine pointing during observations. The reaction wheels impart disturbance forces and torques continuously that cause unwanted motion during imaging. Increased jitter consequently leads to blurring of the image. Therefore, to benefit all SmallSat missions devoted to photometric or spectroscopic astrophysics applications, an on-orbit flight data acquisition and jitter testing campaign was performed in an attempt to help validate the SSDT’s simulation models. This paper describes the process used to validate several simulation models and attempt to characterize the ASTERIA jitter by analyzing the size of the resulting spot size for the target stars as a function of wheel speed, having commanded four wheel speeds for each of three stars of known brightness. After summarizing the on-orbit observation and jitter level measurement process, this paper compares the results obtained from the flight operational environment to the corresponding set of simulation jitter levels. Though the flight data obtained during this experiment was not sufficient to validate the simulation’s jitter model, other models have been validated with flight data, including the magnetic field, orbit propagation, sun position, and long-duration orbit decay models, which may be used by all other projects that use the SSDT’s simulation to increase system capability knowledge."

Research in other domains shows that too much or too little trust in autonomous tools can have negative consequences, but we are not aware of any study that has investigated trust in autonomous tools in the highly interactive context of a software engineering workplace. We present the results of a ten week ethnographic case study of engineers collaborating with autonomous tools to write flight software at a large national space exploration organization to support high stakes missions. We find that trust in an autonomous software engineering tool in this setting was influenced by four main factors: the tool’s transparency, social context, an organization’s associated processes, and its usability. We outline theoretical implications for future research into trust in autonomous software engineering tools, and practical implications for tool designers and organizations conducting high stakes work with autonomous tools."

Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and computational structural analysis of a key inner disk component realized for this effort: the origami-folded optical shield. The optical shield is a 10 m-diameter lightweight cover that makes the inner disk opaque. It stows within a 2.3 m-diameter volume by using an origami-inspired wrapping pattern, and is deployed passively by the inner disk perimeter truss. The fold pattern was generated by a custom algorithm based one existing generative design approaches. This prototype demonstrated critical functions: stowage in a compact volume, static equilibrium when stowed and deployed, and low strain when stowed. Four separate computational structural analysis models of the optical shield were de- veloped, at varying levels of fidelity and using a variety of software solutions: Abaqus, RAPID, and ADAMS. These models were intended to pathfind approaches for modeling the stowage and deployment of the inner disk, and to demonstrate that the optical shield is amenable existing structural modeling approaches. These models were found to adequately capture pertinent stowage and deployment behavior of the optical shield prototype."

It is likely that this reliance will continue, and increase further in future missions. Spacecraft autonomy is used when operator intervention is not available or feasible, or when dynamic aspects of a spacecraft situation cannot be predicted in advance. This paper provides case studies of several successfully verified autonomous software systems across multiple spacecraft, flight phases (launch, transit, entry and landing, science utilization), and software classifications, and can serve as examples to future missions in methods of successfully assuring spacecraft autonomy."

Our method uses spatial modulation of the CXB signal on the NuSTAR detectors through the telescope’s side aperture. Based on the NuSTAR observations of selected extragalactic fields with a total exposure of 7 Ms, we have estimated the CXB 3–20 keV flux to be 2.8×10−11erg s−1cm−2deg−2, which is∼8 per cent higher than that measured withHEAO-1and consistent with the INTEGRAL measurement. The inferred CXB spectral shape in the3–20 keV energy band is consistent with the canonical model of Gruber et al. We demonstrate that the spatially modulated CXB signal measured by NuSTAR is not contaminated by systematic noise and is limited by photon statistics. The measured relative scatter of the CXB intensity between different sky directions is compatible with cosmic variance, which opens new possibilities for studying CXB anisotropy over the whole sky with NuSTAR."

This characterization provides timely insights important for accurate interpretation of ionospheric parameters inferred from the recently launched Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) observations. Quantification of photoelectron impact is enabled by the fact that conjugate photoelectrons (CPEs) directly affect FUV airglow emissions but not RO measurements. We demonstrate a technique for estimation of photoelectron fluxes and their spectra by combining coincident ICON and COSMIC2 measurements and show that a significant fraction of ICON-FUV measurements is affected by CPEs during the winter solstice. A comparison of estimated photoelectron fluxes with measured photoelectron spectra is used to gain further insights into the estimation method and reveals consistent values within 10–60 eV.

Plain Language Summary  

The impact of solar radiation on the atmosphere produces highly energetic electrons, which travel freely along the magnetic Earth's field lines from one hemisphere to the other. When these electrons flow from the sunlit side into the nightside hemisphere, they interact with the neutral species and produce noticeable effects in the ionosphere such as an increase in electron temperature and enhancement of airglow emissions. This study presents a method to quantify the amount of precipitating electrons and their energy on a global scale using two recent satellite missions, ICON and COSMIC2. Our results demonstrate that coincident far-ultraviolet (ICON) and radio-occultation (COSMIC2) measurements from space are valuable resources to study precipitating electrons in the ionosphere and their impact on inferring ionospheric plasma parameters."

However, recent advancements in satellite remote sensing, including the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) offer new tools for generating satellite derived bathymetry (SDB). The key payload onboard ICESat-2 is the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a micro-pulse, photon-counting LiDAR system, simultaneously emitting six separate 532 nm beams at 10 kHz pulse rate. However, despite its high resolution, the major limitation for bathymetry is  that ICESat-2 only provides along-track height profiles, leaving observation gaps between the parallel ground tracks. Merging ICESat-2 observations with optical multispectral imagery, as demonstrated herein, provides an effective solution for deriving a full scene of water depth in light of the spectral attenuation behavior. This study aims to combine ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 optical data to derive shallow water bathymetry (depth <20 m) at six islands and reefs in the South China Sea. ICESat-2 ATL03 point clouds of georeferenced photons are first filtered to determine the seafloor elevation along the ground track. Results indicate a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26–0.61 m as compared with independent observations from an airborne LiDAR campaign. Next, three semi-empirical functions, namely the Modified Linear/Polynomial/Exponential Ratio Models with its kernel formed by the log ratio between Sentinel-2′s green and blue bands, are used to fit the spectral data with ICESat-2 height profiles. After water depth mapping using the trained model, independent ICESat-2 point clouds are used to validate the Sentinel-2 derived bathymetry. The RMSE values of the three models using the weighted average of multiple images for these six islands are within 0.50–0.90 m in 0–15 m deep. We also demonstrate that a synthesis of satellite laser altimetry and optical remote sensing can produce SDB results that potentially meet the requirement of category C in Zones of Confidence (ZOC) of the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) in 0–8 m deep. It is foreseen that ICESat-2 will be a helpful tool for mapping coastal and shallow waters around the world especially where bathymetric data are unavailable."

Treatments for the suppression and eradication of insect populations undergo substantial testing to ascertain their efficacy and safety, but the generally limited spatial and temporal scope of such studies limit knowledge of how contextual factors encountered in operational contexts shape the relative success of pest management treatments. These contextual factors potentially include ecological characteristics of the treated area, or the timing of treatments relative to pest phenology and weather events. We used an extensive database on over 1000 treatments of nascent populations of Lymantria dispar (L.) (gypsy moth) to examine how place-based and time-varying conditions shape the success of management treatments.

RESULTS
We found treatment success to vary across states and years, and to be highest in small treatment blocks that are isolated from other populations. In addition, treatment success tended to be lower in treatment blocks with open forest canopies, possibly owing to challenges of effectively distributing treatments in these areas.

CONCLUSIONS
Our findings emphasize the importance of monitoring for early detection of nascent gypsy moth colonies in order to successfully slow the spread of the invasion. Additionally, operations research should address best practices for effectively treating with patchy and open forest canopies. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."

Immediately following the launch, the VIIRS passed a series of intensive calibration and validation tests, after which regular calibration and operation activities have continued successfully for more than three years. The production of NASA Collection 2 Level 1B (C2 L1B) for N20 VIIRS began in summer 2019. In this article, we evaluate the early mission performance of the N20 VIIRS reflective solar bands (RSB) covering the first three full years of operation. The calibrated RSB gains are calculated primarily from the onboard solar diffuser (SD) and used in generating the C2 L1B reflectance and radiance products. We also show the on-orbit performance of the instrument noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and a reflectance uncertainty assessment. Comparisons are made to the first three years of operation of the first VIIRS instrument, aboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. We evaluate the long-term stability of the calibrated N20 RSB reflectance product by looking at the long-term trends of lunar observations and data from the pseudo-invariant Libya 4 desert site. The N20 RSB have had excellent early mission performance, with changes in the gain of less than 0.5% in the first three years across all detectors, stable L1B reflectance, and very stable values of detector SNR and reflectance uncertainty."

Understanding the extent of ecosystem degradation is critical for estimating risks to ecosystems, yet there are few existing methods to map degradation at the ecosystem scale and none using freely available satellite data for mangrove ecosystems. In this study, we developed a quantitative classification model of mangrove ecosystem degradation using freely available earth observation data. Crucially, a conceptual model of mangrove ecosystem degradation was established to identify suitable remote sensing variables that support the quantitative classification model, bridging the gap between satellite-derived variables and ecosystem degradation with explicit ecological links. We applied our degradation model to two case-studies, the mangroves of Rakhine State, Myanmar, which are severely threatened by anthropogenic disturbances, and Shark River within the Everglades National Park, USA, which is periodically disturbed by severe tropical storms. Our model suggested that 40% (597 km2) of the extent of mangroves in Rakhine showed evidence of degradation. In the Everglades, the model suggested that the extent of degraded mangrove forest increased from 5.1% to 97.4% following the Category 4 Hurricane Irma in 2017. Quantitative accuracy assessments indicated the model achieved overall accuracies of 77.6% and 79.1% for the Rakhine and the Everglades, respectively. We highlight that using an ecological conceptual model as the basis for building quantitative classification models to estimate the extent of ecosystem degradation ensures the ecological relevance of the classification models. Our developed method enables researchers to move beyond only mapping ecosystem distribution to condition and degradation as well. These results can help support ecosystem risk assessments, natural capital accounting, and restoration planning and provide quantitative estimates of ecosystem degradation for new global biodiversity targets."

In this paper a measurement of the iron spectrum is presented in the range of kinetic energy per nucleon from 10GeV/n to 2.0 TeV/n allowing the inclusion of iron in the list of elements studied with unprecedented precision by space-borne instruments.  The measurement is based on observations carried out from January 2016 to May 2020.  The CALET instrument can identify individual nuclear species via a measurement of their electric charge with a dynamic range extending far beyond iron (up to atomic number Z = 40).  The energy is measured by a homogeneous calorimeter with a total equivalent thickness of 1.2 proton interaction lengths preceded by a thin (3 radiation lengths) imaging section providing tracking and energy sampling.  The analysis of the data and the detailed assessment of systematic uncertainties are described and results are compared with the findings of previous experiments.  The observed differential spectrum is consistent within the errors with previous experiments. In the region from 50 GeV/n to 2 TeV/ n our present data are compatible with a single power law with spectral index−2.60±0.03."

The magnitude of forest damages and the rates and mechanisms of forest recovery following Maria provide important benchmarks for understanding the ecology of extreme events. We used airborne Lidar data acquired before (2017) and after Maria (2018, 2020) to quantify landscape-scale changes in forest structure along a 439-ha elevational gradient (100–800 m) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest. Damages from Maria were widespread, with 73% of the study area losing ≥ 1 m in canopy height (mean = −7.1 m). Taller forests at lower elevations suffered more damage than shorter forests above 600 m. Yet only 13.5% of the study area had canopy heights ≤ 2 m in 2018, a typical threshold for forest gaps, highlighting the importance of damaged trees and advanced regeneration on post-storm forest structure. Heterogeneous patterns of regrowth and recruitment yielded shorter and more open forests by 2020. Nearly 45% of forests experienced initial height loss > 1 m (2017–2018) followed by rapid height gain > 1 m (2018–2020), whereas 21.6% of forests with initial height losses showed little or no height gain, and 17.8% of forests exhibited no height changes larger than ± 1 m in either period. Canopy layers < 10 m tall accounted for most increases in canopy height and fractional cover between 2018 and 2020, with gains split evenly between height growth and lateral crown expansion by surviving individuals. These findings benchmark rates of gap formation, crown expansion, and canopy closure following hurricane damage and highlight the diversity of ecosystem impacts from heterogeneous spatial patterns and vertical stratification of forest regrowth following a major disturbance event."

As a result of their frequent omission from national forest resource assessments and a lack of readily available very-high-resolution remotely sensed imagery, TOF status and characterization has until now, been unknown. Here, we assess the capacity of openly available 10 m ESA Sentinel constellation satellite imagery for mapping TOF extent at the national level in Bangladesh. In addition, we estimate canopy height for TOF using a TanDEM-X DEM. We map 2,233,578 ha of TOF in Bangladesh with a mean canopy height of 7.3 m. We map 31 and 53% more TOF than existing estimates of TOF and forest, respectively. We find TOF in Bangladesh is nationally fragmented as a consequence of agricultural activity, yet is capable of maintaining connectedness between remaining stands. Now, TOF accounting is feasible at the national scale using readily available datasets, enabling the mainstream inclusion of TOF in national forest resource assessments for other countries."

of The Oceanography Society (TOS) Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Committee’s series of columns in Oceanography, here we provide a glossary of terms that are often used while discussing topics such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and gender identity.

It should be explicitly stated that this list is neither definitive nor exhaustive. Indeed, the terms included here are likely heavily influenced by the authors’ own lived experiences and the lenses
through which we see the world. Language is a living entity, a fluid social construct subject to rapid changes and overlaid with regional nuances. Indeed, what may be accurate and acceptable terminology for one person may be entirely unacceptable for another. Keeping this in mind, the following glossary is an attempt to group together some of the acronyms and phrases that are most commonly used today in social justice studies and bodies of work and that may have particular relevance to our community of ocean-related scientists, technologists, and stakeholders. We have borrowed heavily from a wide range of excellent existing scholarship and activism and have cited all sources used. We encourage the reader to follow the links to these multimedia resources and, perhaps, use them as teaching and discussion materials with your students, colleagues, and mentees. Finally, it is our hope that this glossary, along with the links provided to more comprehensive definitions and discussions, helps to define terms that you may have heard used, but not understood, and that it will serve to remind us of the power of the words we use in our everyday professional and personal lives.

While the effect of solar shading is relatively consistent from year-to-year, the redistribution of snow due to wind is more variable–capable of producing snowpacks that have varying degrees of uniformity across these hydrologically-important catchments. A reasonable hypothesis is that a warmer climate will cause snowfall to become more dense (i.e. wetter and heavier), possibly leading to less wind redistribution and thus produce a more uniformly distributed snowpack across the landscape. In this study, we investigate the role of increasingly uniform spatial snowpack distributions on streamflow generation in the Green Lakes Valley Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research station, within the headwaters of the Boulder Creek watershed in Colorado. A set of idealized hydrologic simulation experiments driven by reconstructed snowpacks spanning 2001–2014 show that more a more uniform spatial snowpack distribution leads to an earlier melt-out of31 days on average and tends to produce less total streamflow, with maximum decreases as large as 7.5%. Isolating the role of snowpack heterogeneity from melt-season precipitation, we find that snowpack uniformity reduces total streamflow by as much as 13.2%. Reductions in streamflow are largely explained by greater expo-sure to solar radiation in the uniformly distributed case relative to a more heterogeneous snowpack, with this exposure driving shifts towards earlier snowmelt and changes in soil water storage. Overall, we find that the runoff efficiency from shallower snowpacks is more sensitive to the effects of uniformity than deeper snowpacks, which has potential implications for a warming climate where shallower snowpacks and enhanced sensitivities may be present."

However, adhesive bonds are susceptible to minute levels of contamination accumulated during assembly that can lead to unpredictable, weak bonds. Current methods of measuring bond strength are all destructive mechanical tests. To overcome these challenges, redundant load paths (e.g., mechanical fasteners) are often implemented in secondary-bonded, primary-structures, which can greatly reduce structural performance. This study investigated reformulated aerospace epoxy matrix resins with stoichiometric offset to inhibit cure of the matrix resin prior to assembly. Inhibited resins can reflow and mix across the joint interface, which eliminates the material discontinuity and forms a homogenous joint with reliable fracture properties. The goal of this study was to develop and demonstrate secondary composite assemblies that are mechanically and microscopically indistinguishable from a co-cured composite joint. This article describes the development of latent epoxy resins, the fabrication of test articles, and the mechanical properties measured from experimental joints compared with conventional, co-cured laminates. Methods of in-line quality control using and infrared spectroscopy and post-assembly forensics are also described. The final mode-II fracture toughness measured from precracked AERoBOND specimens was similar to that measured from co-cured laminates indicating that later cure epoxy materials could be a suitable replacement for secondary bonding."

The soil is considered to be a stratified medium. The reflectivity from the soil surface is found by considering the soil to be composed of a finely layered structure with layer widths that are small compared to a wavelength. A well-known transmission line algorithm is then used to compute the reflectivity at the surface. Emissivity is obtained as (1 – reflectivity). It assumed that the soil is at a constant temperature of 300o K when determining the brightness temperature. A soil moisture profile consisting of two homogeneous layers separated by a layer of linearly varying soil moisture is investigated. The study is made at an incident angle of 40O for horizontal polarization at 0.8 and 1.4 GHz. Two variations of the basic profile are considered: a transition from a layer of lesser moisture to a layer of greater moisture and the opposite. In both cases the P band signal shows greater penetration than the L band case. There is greater penetration in the transition to drier soils. In both cases the L band signals show sensitivity to
only the upper surface of the soil as expected."

Because the star possesses Herbig–Haro objects traveling in out flowing bipolar jets, it was suggested that the drop in brightness was due to a clump of dust entrained in a disk wind, blocking the line of sight toward the star. In order to quantify this hypothesis, we investigated the brightness drop at visible wavelengths and the brightening at near-IR wavelengths of HD 163296 using the Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer Code,HOCHUNK3D. We created three models to understand the events. Model 1 describes the quiescent state of the system. Model 2 describes the change in structure that led to the drop in brightness in 2001.Model 3 describes the structure needed to produce the observed 2002 brightening of the near-IR wavelengths. Models 2 and 3 utilize a combination of a disk wind and central bipolar flow. By introducing a filled bipolar cavity in Models 2 and 3, we were able to successfully simulate a jet-like structure for the star with a disk wind and created the drop and subsequent increase in brightness of the system. On the other hand, when the bipolar cavity is not filled, Model 1 replicates the quiescent state of the system"

Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during its commissioning phase, we have carried out a number of targeted deep searches of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) γ-ray sources. On February 27, 2018 we discovered an isolated millisecond pulsar (MSP), PSR J0318+0253, coincident with the unassociated γ-ray source 3FGL J0318.1+0252. PSR J0318+0253 has a spin period of 5.19 ms, a dispersion measure (DM) of 26 pc cm−3 corresponding to a DM distance of about 1.3 kpc, and a period-averaged flux density of (∼11±2) µJy at L-band (1.05–1.45 GHz). Among all high energy MSPs, PSR J0318+0253 is the faintest ever detected in radio bands, by a factor of at least ∼4 in terms of L-band fluxes. With the aid of the radio ephemeris, an analysis of 9.6 years of Fermi-LAT data revealed that PSR J0318+0253 also displays strong γ-ray pulsations. Follow-up observations carried out by both Arecibo and FAST suggest a likely spectral turn-over around 350 MHz. This is the first result from the collaboration between FAST and the Fermi-LAT teams as well as the first confirmed new MSP discovery by FAST, raising hopes for the detection of many more MSPs. Such discoveries will make a significant contribution to our understanding of the neutron star zoo while potentially contributing to the future detection of gravitational waves, via pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments."

It is a partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the German Research Center for Geosciences, GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ). Under this partnership, the United States provides the project management, satellites and instruments, Germany provides the launch and mission operations. The partners share responsibilities for producing science data products. GRACE Follow-On, like its predecessor GRACE, consists of twin satellites which fly in a tandem formation at a near polar orbit separated by about 200 km along track. The mission continues the work of GRACE by tracking the movement of water, observing changes in ice sheets and sea level to provide a unique view of Earth’s changing climate. The satellites were launched May 22, 2018 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, in California, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket. Launch and Early Operations (LEOP) were completed within the first week and on-orbit commissioning proceeded for the next 8 months. The GRACE Follow-On mission is designed to last five years. The mission operations team has had to address several technical challenges early into the planned five-year mission life. The commissioning period was extended by 5 months to successfully address these issues, making it possible for the mission to meet key requirements for delivery and quality of the science data products. This paper will address the challenges faced by GRACE Follow-On and the actions taken by the mission operations team to continue to safely operate the mission."

The suite of powerful instruments necessary for this mission, combined with the harsh environment, require an elaborate single phase, mechanically pumped flow loop (MPFL) to redistribute waste heat around the spacecraft, thus minimizing energy requirements and avoiding the need for constant heating of the propulsion tanks. At the heart of this MPFL is a pump which will circulate fluid for the entirety of the 12-year mission; however, during initial qualification testing, anomalous behavior raised serious concerns regarding the pump and system design. Due to the critical nature of the pump, a major investigation was launched to evaluate the pump, system design, and the testing methodology employed to investigate this anomaly. This investigation resulted in a highly detailed analysis of the test loop, revised procedures, and the isolation/removal of variables impacting the quality of the observed pump behavior. The resulting test loop permitted comprehensive monitoring of the pump in the MPFL, including: flow rate, inlet and outlet static pressures, temperature, power consumption, and pump speed. Additionally, the investigation of the anomaly revealed several key lessons learned and helped institute a new set of best practices for future MPFL tests."

Part III of this system considers the formation of 43 different primary crystalline and amorphous phases in chondrules, which are diverse igneous droplets that formed in environments with high dust/gas ratios during an interval of planetesimal accretion and differentiation between 4566 and 4561 Ma. Chondrule mineralogy is complex, with several generations of initial droplet formation via various proposed heating mechanisms, followed in many instances by multiple episodes of reheating and partial melting. Primary chondrule mineralogy thus reflects a dynamic stage of mineral evolution, when the diversity and distribution of natural condensed solids expanded significantly."

These showers produce optical and radio emission that can be detected by orbital and suborbital platforms. We present results of radio emission simulations using ZHAireS for observation from low-Earth orbit as part of NASA's nuSpaceSim program to develop a comprehensive end-to-end simulation package to model these signals. Peculiar properties of the radio emission arise from the fact that these showers develop in extremely rarified portions of the Earth's atmosphere and, being observed from hundreds of kilometers distance, have distinct coherent emission features compared to ground observations."

Isolating neighborhoods may be used to further explore the boundary between the Lissajous and quasihalo orbits at en- ergies where the halo orbits have bifurcated from the Lyapunov orbits. A method to compute trajectories that are forward and backward asymptotic to the libration point invariant set using very small velocity corrections is developed here. The method is then used to compute representative trajectories within this region and characterize their behavior.

Particularly pertinent to trajectory control and maneuver design were the planetary protection requirements for preventing microbial contamination of Mars. Consequently, the aimpoints for injection and early TCMs were biased away to reduce the probability of unintended Mars impact, thus satisfying these requirements.

Their relative affordability and short development timeline have made them attractive options to complement larger space vehicles, conduct reconnaissance and other finite tasks. The specialized nature of many CubeSat missions do not make their security any less important as their missions could easily be matters of national security. This paper demonstrates the use of attack tree analysis to assess vulnerabilities of a CubeSat. First, we abstract and build an architectural model of an operational CubeSat. We then create a series of attack trees for the abstracted architecture to illustrate a series of potential attack vectors for small satellites. We conclude by discussing some strategies that could be employed to improve CubeSat resilience."

However, recent progress in optical edge design has led to much reduced predictions of stray light deriving from this source. Secondary sources now also play a role; these sources arise from two or more reflections from the starshade structure. These multiple reflections allow light to reach the telescope from parts of the structure that are shaded from direct sunlight. Here we analyze the secondary sources for the starshade model developed as part of the NASA’s S5 starshade technology development and show the effects of optical edge mechanical design variants and mitigations."

These challenges motivate an integrated approach to planning and execution that is able to respond intelligently to variation. We examine this problem in the context of the Europa Lander mission concept, and propose a planning and execution framework that responds to feedback and task failure using two techniques: flexible execution and replanning with plan optimization. We develop a theoretical framework to predict the value of each of these techniques, and we compare these predictions to empirical results generated in simulation. We demonstrate that an integrated approach to planning and execution that is grounded in flexible execution, replanning, and utility maximization will be an enabling technology for future tightly-constrained planetary surface missions."

Astrometric surveys are also critical pre-cursor observations for identifying targets for future direct imaging missions, such as the HabEx and LUVOIR mission concepts. However, Earth-mass planets orbiting Sun-like stars within 10 pc only cause a 0.3 uas astrometric signal, which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the current state-of-the-art. In order to advance the technologies needed for future astrometry instruments, a testbed capable of simulating and measuring equivalent Earth-like exoplanet astrometric signals was created. The testbed has a stable light source that simulates a field of stars and can introduce a sub-uas astrometric signal onto a central artificial target star. This is done by illuminating an array of pinholes lithographically printed onto a glass substrate and translating, with picometer resolution, a target-star pinhole located on a centrally cut flexure feature. To detect this motion, a diffractive pupil is used to calibrate the limiting optical distortions of an Offner relay. Presented in this paper are the requirements, design, and implementation of the wide-field astrometry testbed’s light source."

To perform this feat, the entry, descent, and landing navigation filter must be initialized with an estimate of the spacecraft state, which includes attitude from the cruise attitude control subsystem. Accuracy of this initial attitude estimate has an impact on important metrics such as touchdown velocity. This paper presents a post-landing reconstruction of the attitude initialization error budget, showing that the requirement of 0.15 deg ($3\sigma$, per axis) was met. Each error source is described and analyzed, including flight telemetry where possible. Analysis of the error budget shows that it is driven by systematic sun sensor errors, star-scanner-to-sun-sensor alignment stability, and inertial-measurement-unit-to-sun-sensor alignment stability. Finally, a contingency plan to initialize the navigation filter in the event of a star scanner failure is presented. While this plan was not needed in flight, results indicate that the attitude initialization requirement could have still been met in this off-nominal scenario."

Growth of the Modified Two-Stream (MTSI) and Lower Hybrid Drift (LHDI) instabilities was found with wave propagation in the r-z (or in-) plane and azimuthal (or out-of-plane) directions, respectively. In the analysis of the LHDI electron collisions were found to be insufficient to quench the instability in a region contained by the thruster ion beam and hollow cathode plume. The implication of the findings is that ions may be heated anomalously by these instabilities, in both the out-of-plane and in-plane directions, thereby altering the velocity field and enhancing the energy of those ions that strike nearby thruster surfaces. In this article we summarize the solution of the dispersion relation for each of these instabilities and provide additional results that can be compared directly with data from future plasma diagnostics, including with direct measurements of the wave dispersion."

This constitutes a NP-hard online optimization problem. The right execution time must be dynamically assigned to each event of the PSTN such that the temporal constraints are met, whereas activity durations are progressively observed as the execution unfolds. We propose a dispatching algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search, called Lila, with the following characteristics: (i) it is an anytime algorithm, both offline and online, proven asymptotically optimal; (ii) it returns the current probability of success, either before or at any moment during operations; (iii) it handles any possible continuous or discrete, even non-parametric, probability distributions, as well as inter-dependencies between random variables, exogenous and endogenous uncertainty; and (iv) can be easily extended to handle probabilistic external events, PSTNs with resources, PSTNs with cutoff times and precondition chains, etc. Lila is universal in the sense that it can handle any dispatching protocol, simply by specifying it to the algorithm. It has the unlimited flexibility offered by the simulation paradigm, whilst it asymptotically converges to optimal decisions and/or robustness approximations."

The new reconstructed spatial response functions can be used to reduce errors in the radiances in non-uniform scenes and improve products generated using both AIRS and MODIS data. AIRS spatial response functions are distinct for each of its 2378 channels and each of its 90 scan angles. We develop the mathematical model and the optimization framework for deriving spatial response functions for two AIRS channels with low water vapor absorption and various scan angles. We quantify uncertainties in the derived reconstructions and study how they differ from pre-flight spatial response functions. We show that our approach generates reconstructions that agree with the data more accurately compared to pre-flight spatial responses. We derive spatial response functions using data collected during successive dates in order to ascertain the repeatability of the reconstructed spatial response functions. We also compare the derived spatial response functions based on data collected in the beginning, the middle, and at the current state of the mission in order to study changes in reconstructions over time."

We aggregate 3D measurements acquired from a sequence of monocular images by a Structure-from-Motion approach into a local, robot-centric, multi-resolution elevation map of the overflown terrain, which fuses depth measurements according to their lateral surface resolution (pixel-footprint) in a probabilistic framework based on the concept of dynamic Level of Detail. Map aggregation only requires depth maps and the associated poses, which are obtained from an on-board Visual Odometry algorithm. An efficient landing site detection method then exploits the features of the underlying multi-resolution map to detect safe landing sites based on the slope, roughness, and quality of the reconstructed terrain surface. The evaluation of the performance of the mapping and landing site detection modules are analyzed independently and jointly in simulated and realworld experiments in order to establish the efficacy of the proposed approach."

From April to August, and from 1 to 8 kilometers altitude, ozone was on average 7% (≈4 nmol/mol) below the 2000–2020 climatological mean. Such low ozone, over several months, and at so many stations, has not been observed in any previous year since at least 2000. Atmospheric composition analyses from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service and simulations from the NASA GMI model indicate that the large 2020 springtime ozone depletion in the Arctic stratosphere contributed less than one-quarter of the observed tropospheric anomaly. The observed anomaly is consistent with recent chemistry-climate model simulations, which assume emissions reductions similar to those caused by the COVID-19 crisis. COVID-19 related emissions reductions appear to be the major cause for the observed reduced free tropospheric ozone in 2020."

After the planets formed, their mantles were likely completely molten with volatiles dissolving and exsolving from the melt. In order to understand these planets and prepare for future observations, the magma ocean phase of these worlds must be understood. To simulate these planets, we have combined existing models of stellar evolution, atmospheric escape, tidal heating, radiogenic heating, magma ocean cooling, planetary radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present Magm Oc, a versatile magma ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky Super-Earth GJ 1132b and early Earth. We simulate the coupled magma ocean-atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth oceans. We also reanalyze the structures of these planets and find they have water mass fractions of 0–0.23, 0.01–0.21, and 0.11–0.24 for planets e, f, and g, respectively. Our model does not make a strong prediction about the water and oxygen content of the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 e at the time of mantle solidification. In contrast, the model predicts that TRAPPIST-1 f and g would have a thick steam atmosphere with a small amount of oxygen at that stage. For all planets that we investigated, we find that only 3 ́5% of the initial water will be locked in the mantle after the magma ocean solidified."

However,  accurate  striping  quantification and  characterization  remain  challenging  due  to  the  large  scene dynamics   observed   at   W/G   bands   of   MHS.   Here   we   have developed  a  set  of  novel  algorithms  for  striping  quantification, decomposition,  characterization,  and  simulation.  Our  algorithm extracts striping from the warm-load and cold-space scenes that are relatively stable. We break down the striping into two parts of thermal and 1/f noise and quantify their absolute magnitude and  relative  ratio.  We  found  a  significant  increase  in  striping at  157  GHz  that  has  more  than  quadrupled  by  October  2019 relative  to  its  normal  level.  Regardless  of  the  degradation,  the ratio of thermal and 1/f noise remains the same. Our simulation reproduces all the characteristics of striping against observation. It is shown that 1/f noise generates sharp, non-periodic stripes, while thermal noise also generates stripes but with smoother band features. The latter is due to the periodic calibration that has a chopping effect. The striping percentage, defined as the ratio of 1/f to total noise, shows no dependence on the scene temperature. Striping  is  pronounced  not  only  in  157  GHz  but  also  in  89  and190 GHz with the striping percentage over 50%, while lower in183 GHz of 20%. The results provide insights for quantifying and understanding  striping.  Our  algorithm  can  be  applied  to  other radiometers and to simulate striping for evaluating its impact in data  assimilation  and  science  products."

We study: (1) the expected rate of lensing at current detector sensitivity and the implications of a non-observation of strong lensing or a stochastic gravitational-wave background on the merger-rate density at high redshift; (2) how the interpretation of individual high-mass events would change if they were found to be lensed; (3) the possibility of multiple images due to strong lensing by galaxies or galaxy clusters; and (4) possible wave-optics effects due to point-mass microlenses. Several pairs of signals in the multiple-image analysis show similar parameters and, in this sense, are nominally consistent with the strong lensing hypothesis. However, taking into account population priors, selection effects, and the prior odds against lensing, these events do not provide sufficient evidence for lensing. Overall, we find no compelling evidence for lensing in the observed gravitational-wave signals from any of these analyses."

Transients with durations ofmilliseconds to a few seconds in the 24–4096 Hz frequency band are targeted by the search, with noassumptions made regarding the incoming signal direction, polarization, or morphology. Gravitationalwaves from compact binary coalescences that have been identified by other targeted analyses are detected,but no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational wave bursts is found. Sensitivities to a varietyof signals are presented. These include updated upper limits on the source rate density as a function of thecharacteristic frequency of the signal, which are roughly an order of magnitude better than previous upperlimits. This search is sensitive to sources radiating as little as∼10−10M⊙c2in gravitational waves at∼70Hz from a distance of 10 kpc, with 50% detection efficiency at a false alarm rate of one per century.The sensitivity of this search to two plausible astrophysical sources is estimated: neutron starfmodes,which may be excited by pulsar glitches, as well as selected core-collapse supernova models."

This poses a serious threat to the survival of Asian elephants, a keystone wildlife species essential for maintaining Bhutan’s forest ecosystems and rich biodiversity. With expanding urban areas, HECs present challenges to conservation efforts in the region. The team partnered with the Bhutan Foundation, the Bhutan Tiger Center, and Bhutan Ecological Society to help mitigate this issue using remote sensing technology and NASA Earth observations. The team refined Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps for 2010–2019 generated in previous terms and elephant corridor maps to include information on human settlements using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. We generated LULC change maps and forecasted the LULC to 2030 using TerrSet Land Change Modeler, providing insights into future elephant habitat suitability in southern Bhutan. The results indicated that built-up areas increased approximately 688.9% from 2010 to 2019 and the forecasted 2030 LULC also predicted an increase in built-up areas compared to 2019. Suitable corridors in Gelephu intersect cultivated and built-up areas, indicating close proximity of elephants to humans and a need to research alternative corridor strategies. The end products from this project will aid partner organizations in decision-making processes in urban planning and future conservation strategies that include the refined placement of biological corridors to aid elephant movement and reduce the risk of HECs."

A dedicated simulation process is established to cover all relevant disciplines, i.e., aircraft and engine design, engine installation effects, flight simulation, and system noise prediction. The core of the simulation process is comprised of methods at the complexity and fidelity level of conceptual aircraft design, i.e., typical overall aircraft design methods and a semi-empirical approach for the noise modeling. Dedicated interfaces allow to process data from high fidelity simulation that will support or even replace initial low fidelity results in the long run. All of the results shown and discussed in this study are limited to the fidelity level of conceptual design. The application of the simulation process to the NASA 55t Supersonic Technology Concept Aeroplane, i.e., based on non-proprietary data for this vehicle, yields similar noise level predictions when compared to the published NASA results. This is used as an initial feasibility check of the new process and confirms the underlying methods and models. Such an initial verification of the process is understood as an essential step due to the lack of available noise data for supersonic transport aircraft in general. The advantageous effect of engine noise shielding on the resulting system noise is demonstrated based on predicted level time histories and certification noise levels. After this initial verification, the process is applied to evaluate a conceptual supersonic transport design based on a PhD thesis with two engines mounted under the wing, which is referred to as aircraft TWO. Full access to this vehicle’s design and performance data allows to investigate the influence of flight procedures on the resulting noise impact along approach and departure. These noise results are then assembled according to proposed Federal Aviation Agency regulations in their Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, e.g., speed limitations, for Supersonic transport noise certification and the regulations from Noise Chapters of the Annex 16 from the International Civil Aviation Organization in order to evaluate the resulting levels as a function of the flight procedure."

However, biomass burning emissions and smoke remain among the largest sources of uncertainties in air quality forecasts. In this study, we evaluate the smoke emissions and plume forecasts from 12 state-of-the-art air quality forecasting systems during the Williams Flats fire in Washington State, US, August 2019, which was intensively observed during the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign. Model forecasts with lead times within 1 d are intercompared under the same framework based on observations from multiple platforms to reveal their performance regarding fire emissions, aerosol optical depth (AOD), surface PM2.5, plume injection, and surface PM2.5 to AOD ratio. The comparison of smoke organic carbon (OC) emissions suggests a large range of daily totals among the models, with a factor of 20 to 50. Limited representations of the diurnal patterns and day-to-day variations of emissions highlight the need to incorporate new methodologies to predict the temporal evolution and reduce uncertainty of smoke emission estimates. The evaluation of smoke AOD (sAOD) forecasts suggests overall underpredictions in both the magnitude and smoke plume area for nearly all models, although the high-resolution models have a better representation of the fine-scale structures of smoke plumes. The models driven by fire radiative power (FRP)-based fire emissions or assimilating satellite AOD data generally outperform the others. Additionally, limitations of the persistence assumption used when predicting smoke emissions are revealed by substantial underpredictions of sAOD on 8 August 2019, mainly over the transported smoke plumes, owing to the underestimated emissions on 7 August. In contrast, the surface smoke PM2.5 (sPM2.5) forecasts show both positive and negative overall biases for these models, with most members presenting more considerable diurnal variations of sPM2.5. Overpredictions of sPM2.5 are found for the models driven by FRP-based emissions during nighttime, suggesting the necessity to improve vertical emission allocation within and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Smoke injection heights are further evaluated using the NASA Langley Research Center's Differential Absorption High Spectral Resolution Lidar (DIAL-HSRL) data collected during the flight observations. As the fire became stronger over 3–8 August, the plume height became deeper, with a day-to-day range of about 2–9 km a.g.l. However, narrower ranges are found for all models, with a tendency of overpredicting the plume heights for the shallower injection transects and underpredicting for the days showing deeper injections. The misrepresented plume injection heights lead to inaccurate vertical plume allocations along the transects corresponding to transported smoke that is 1 d old. Discrepancies in model performance for surface PM2.5 and AOD are further suggested by the evaluation of their ratio, which cannot be compensated for by solely adjusting the smoke emissions but are more attributable to model representations of plume injections, besides other possible factors including the evolution of PBL depths and aerosol optical property assumptions. By consolidating multiple forecast systems, these results provide strategic insight on pathways to improve smoke forecasts."

Even though the 1400-1427 MHz frequency used by SMAP is a protected portion of the spectrum, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is still observed that can corrupt the radiometer’s measurements. Nine distinct algorithms are implemented as part of SMAP’s level 1 processing to detect and filter out RFI contributions. However, any remaining undetected RFI are major concern especially at the locations of cal/val sites used for evaluating soil moisture retrieval performance. This paper presents an analysis of the RFI environment at SMAP cal/val site locations and assesses the impact of RFI on soil moisture retrievals at those locations."

In many cases sound is naturally omnidirectional and travels at known speeds which depend on the composition and density of the atmosphere. The differences in the time of flight of signals received by a distributed microphone network can be used to locate the source of the sound. We suggest this property is ideal for mobile planetary robots and can be used to expand the exploration envelope considerably by directing camera pointing or rover path planning thus extending beyond line-of-sight exploration. Acoustic signatures have been used in a variety of fields (e.g., sonar, heavy machinery) to identify and catalog sounds associated with a specific vessels and malfunctioning machinery. Our ears have cataloged hundreds of sounds and we continuously use these sounds both consciously and subconsciously to extract information about our surroundings. This paper investigates the use acoustic measurements on other planetary bodies that could be used to characterize specific environmental parameters such as rain droplet size, wind speed, thunder, or dust devil vortex diameter. The paper identified other important sound sources that are thought to occur on other bodies in our solar system include; booming or singing dunes, waves, rivers, streams, fluidfalls, geysers, hurricanes, tornados, ice flow, volcanoes, planetary quakes, avalanche, rock slides and ice cracking. In addition, this paper focused on issues associated with the development of appropriate sensors for the network including the specification of the sensitivity, frequency response, and directional response of each of the microphones in the network in order to aid in localization of sound sources. We also presented our initial development of the transducers for potential mission targets including Mars and Titan and investigated the use of signal processing techniques including windowing, time frequency plots and correlation techniques to resolve phase differences between sensors in the network to aid in localization. We also identified additional benefits of these sensor networks in that they could used as engineering sensors to diagnose mechanical malfunctions on a rover or lander actuators or mechanisms.  We also noted that they could also enhance public outreach by adding sound to videos."

Vision-based pose determination can be challenging in case of unfavorable illumination, time-varying conditions due to rotational motion and relative orbit, and scale ambiguity resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel collaborative pose determination algorithm called Multi- Spacecraft Simultaneous Estimation of Pose and Shape algorithm or M-SEPS.Within M-SEPS, a team of chaser spacecraft, each equipped with a monocular camera, exchange information over a local network to jointly estimate the relative kinematic state of the target and its sparse shape landmarks. In this approach, each spacecraft processes its own images and observes particular target landmarks in parallel and in a distributed fashion. Then, the local network is exploited by the spacecraft to share their consensus proposals and aggregate them to achieve the joint estimate. We validate our algorithm using simulations of relative orbits and observations, captured by each chaser spacecraft. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first cooperative, vision-based algorithm for estimating the pose and shape of a space object for an arbitrary number of spacecraft."

Its high appeal for astrobiology and habitability implications in the solar system and beyond have made it the subject of intense scientific inquiry and of many past mission studies. The NASA flagship Europa Clipper mission [1] is currently in development and slated to launch in 2024. After insertion into the Jupiter system, it will conduct more than 40 flybys of Europa over the course of several years [2]. The suite of nine science instruments is uniquely suited to this flyby tour strategy, providing remote sensing and in situ observations of Europa and its relationship to Jupiter [3]. The primary objective of Europa Clipper is to assess the habitability of Europa, an overarching goal that rests on improving our understanding of Europa’s interior structure, composition, and geologic activity. Here we describe the Gravity/Radio Science (G/RS) investigation of Europa Clipper, which will make important observations to address key science goals."

Here we use N-body simulations of the formation of the Kuiper Belt and Oort cloud as well as a survey simulator to compare models of the solar system with and without a ninth planet to one another as well as to observations. The main mechanism for TNOs to be deposited into the distant (a > 50 au), detached (q > 40 au) region of the Kuiper Belt in the eight-planet model is Kozai–Lidov oscillation of objects in mean motion resonances (MMR) with Neptune. This effect does not deposit low-inclination (i ≲ 20°) objects into this region. However, we find that the ninth planet generates a group of distant, detached TNOs at low inclinations that are not present in the eight-planet model. This disparity between the eight-planet and nine-planet models could provide a strong constraint on a possible planet nine with further detections of TNOs in the distant, detached region of the Kuiper Belt."

For isolated encounters, Nc equals Pc.
For multi-encounter interactions, Nc can exceed Pc and is significantly easier to approximate semi-analytically.
Estimating Nc requires integrating the collision rate over time throughout an interaction, with each required _Nc
value calculated as a statistical expectation value based on the uncertainty distributions of initial orbital states. The uncertainty distributions are estimated from orbit determination analyses of satellite trajectory measurements. The formulation accounts for the nonlinear orbital motion of the satellites, and derives Nc and _Nc expressions for Monte Carlo simulations as well as semi-analytical approximations for single- and multi-encounter interactions."

However, the precipitation in high latitudes remains highly uncertain. We compare wintertime precipitation in the North Atlantic using GPM-IMERG, GPCP, MERRA-2 and ERA5 between 2000–2019 and show that while interannual variations between products are similar, large differences in magnitudes exist, specifically in areas of higher precipitation where Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) produces an excess of 2 mm day−1. EOF analysis demonstrates observations and reanalyses show similar spatial variability in the most dominant precipitation patterns and are highly correlated (r = −0.6) with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Analysis of IMERG extreme precipitation further shows that it is most densely populated in this same area where large discrepancies in magnitudes between products exist. IMERG extreme precipitation was found to drive the monthly anomalies. Future work needs to be focused on extreme precipitation characteristics, patterns and the driving atmospheric factors."

The advances in phenology matching models provide a feasible means to monitor crop phenological progress using remote sensing observations, with a priori information of reference shapes and reference phenological transition dates. Yet the underlying geometrical scaling assumption of models, together with the challenge in defining phenological references, hinders the applicability of phenology matching in crop phenological studies. The objective of this study is to develop a novel hybrid phenology matching model to robustly retrieve a diverse spectrum of crop phenological stages using satellite time series. The devised hybrid model leverages the complementary strengths of phenometric extraction methods and phenology matching models. It relaxes the geometrical scaling assumption and can characterize key phenological stages of crop cycles, ranging from farming practice-relevant stages (e.g., planted and harvested) to crop development stages (e.g., emerged and mature). To systematically evaluate the influence of phenological references on phenology matching, four representative phenological reference scenarios under varying levels of phenological calibrations in terms of time and space are further designed with publicly accessible phenological information. The results indicate that the hybrid phenology matching model can achieve high accuracies for estimating corn and soybean phenological growth stages in Illinois, particularly with the year- and region-adjusted phenological reference (R-squared higher than 0.9 and RMSE less than 5 days for most phenological stages). The inter-annual and regional phenological patterns characterized by the hybrid model correspond well with those in the crop progress reports (CPRs) from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Compared to the benchmark phenology matching model, the hybrid model is more robust to the decreasing levels of phenological reference calibrations, and is particularly advantageous in retrieving crop early phenological stages (e.g., planted and emerged stages) when the phenological reference information is limited. This innovative hybrid phenology matching model, together with CPR-enabled phenological reference calibrations, holds 3 considerable promise in revealing spatio-temporal patterns of crop phenology over extended geographical regions."

for the monitoring of dynamic earth systems. Due to the sensor tradeoff, most remote sensing
systems cannot provide images with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Spatiotemporal
image fusion models provide a feasible solution to generate such a type of satellite imagery, yet
existing fusion methods are limited in predicting rapid and/or transient phenological changes.
Additionally, a systematic approach to assessing and understanding how varying levels of temporal
phenological changes affect fusion results is lacking in spatiotemporal fusion research. The objective
of this study is to develop an innovative hybrid deep learning model that can effectively and robustly
fuse the satellite imagery of various spatial and temporal resolutions. The proposed model integrates
two types of network models: super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and long
short-term memory (LSTM). SRCNN can enhance the coarse images by restoring degraded spatial
details, while LSTM can learn and extract the temporal changing patterns from the time-series images.
To systematically assess the effects of varying levels of phenological changes, we identify image
phenological transition dates and design three temporal phenological change scenarios representing
rapid, moderate, and minimal phenological changes. The hybrid deep learning model, alongside
three benchmark fusion models, is assessed in different scenarios of phenological changes. Results
indicate the hybrid deep learning model yields significantly better results when rapid or moderate
phenological changes are present. It holds great potential in generating high-quality time-series
datasets of both high spatial and temporal resolutions, which can further benefit terrestrial system
dynamic studies. The innovative approach to understanding phenological changes’ effect will help
us better comprehend the strengths and weaknesses of current and future fusion models."

In medical imaging,it is extensively used for diagnostics via X-ray computed tomography (CT). We define and derive a tomographyof cloud droplet distributions via passive remote sensing. We use multi-view polarimetric images to fit a 3Dpolarized radiative transfer (RT) forward model. Our motivation is 3D volumetric probing of vertically-developedconvectively-driven clouds that are ill-served by current methods in operational passive remote sensing. Currenttechniques are indeed based on strictly 1D RT modeling and applied to a single cloudy pixel, where cloud geometrydefaults to that of a plane-parallel slab. Incident unpolarized sunlight, once scattered by cloud droplets, changesits polarization state according to droplet size. Therefore, polarimetric measurements in the rainbow and gloryangular regions can be used to infer the droplet size distribution. This work defines and derives a framework for afull 3D tomography of cloud droplets for both their mass concentration in space and their distribution across arange of sizes. This gridded 3D retrieval of key microphysical properties is made tractable by our novel approachthat involves a restructuring and partial linearization of an open-source polarized 3D RT code to accommodate aspecial two-step iterative optimization technique. Physically-realistic synthetic clouds are used to demonstrate themethodology with rigorous uncertainty quantification, while a real-world cloud imaged by AirMSPI is processedto illustrate the new remote sensing capability"

The high operating temperature (HOT) BIRD focal plane arrays (FPAs) offer the same high performance, uniformity, operability, manufacturability, and affordability advantages as InSb. However, mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) HOT-BIRD FPAs can operate at significantly higher temperatures (>150K) than InSb FPAs (typically 80K). Moreover, while InSb has a fixed cutoff wavelength (~5.4 µm), the HOT-BIRD offers a continuous adjustable cutoff wavelength, ranging from ~4 µm to >15 µm, and is therefore also suitable for long wavelength infrared (LWIR) as well. The LWIR detectors based on the BIRD architecture has also demonstrated significant operating temperature advantages over those based on traditional p-n junction designs. Two 6U SmalSat missions CIRAS (Cubesat Infrared Atmospheric Sounder) and HyTI (Hyperspectral Thermal Imager) are based on JPL’s T2SL BIRD focal plane arrays (FPAs). Based on III-V compound semiconductors, the BIRD FPAs offer a breakthrough solution for the realization of low cost (high yield), high-performance FPAs with excellent uniformity and pixel-to-pixel operability. Furthermore, we will discuss the advantages of the utilization of all digital read out integrated circuits with HOT-BIRDs."

These competed missions are motivated by high-value science with low implementation and cost risks. Selectable mission concepts require highly focused science approaches—delivering high quality science “on a budget.” Prospective Principal Investigators (PIs) need to convince NASA that the science they are proposing is both compelling and has high programmatic value. Unfortunately, many of these PIs are not trained in the communication skills needed for “selling” a mission concept to stakeholders. This requires a proposal that presents an investigation in an accessible, relatable, authentic, and believable way. It is the onus of the proposing PI to convince NASA of the value of their particular science concept in a competitive environment, addressing any pre-conceived notions reviewers might have about the concept’s value, complexities, urgency, and other impediments to understanding.The importance of this can be seen in the NASA-sponsored PI Launchpad (Nov 2019 & Jun 2021)1 which was designed to help early career scientists understand the skills, methods, processes, and resources needed to develop compelling science mission concepts; as well as in JPL’s update to their concept maturity model (Jan 2020) which included the addition of Story and Strategy dimensions. This paper provides guidance to assist prospective PIs in developing compelling, science-focused mission concepts. It will provide direction for communicating concepts more clearly to make science objectives more relatable to both reviewers and a broader audience, improving the probability of selection."

Still operational, it makes use of observations from multiple view angles to retrieve aerosol abundance and particle properties. The Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument improves on this heritage by incorporating polarimetry and an expanded spectral range. Combining these data with surface measurements, the relationship between pollution and human health will be explored. MAIA has just completed camera testing, building on the experience from MISR. Spectral calibration now makes use of a double subtractive monochromator, built with the intent to allow the exit slit output to be uniform in spectral content. For radiometric testing, hardware upgrades have included adding UV lamps to the 1.65 cm (65"") integrating sphere, use of a NIST-traceable sphere to establish absolute radiances, and the addition of a UV transfer spectrometer to support characterization of the sphere output from 300 to 2500 nm. During camera build, Newton’s rings were observed in the detector Quantum Efficiency (QE) measurements. This is due to etaloning within the detector itself. Etaloning was also evident in the spectral and radiometric characterizations performed on the completed camera. Spectral metrics, including center wavelength and width, are presented here using a moment’s analysis. This better represents the band properties, particularly in bands where fringing is observed, as compared to a full-width at half-maximum determination. It is believed that the MAIA camera has been carefully characterized, and meet its spectral and radiometric requirements."

The success of its coronagraph instrument ECLIPS (Extreme Coronagraph for Living Planetary Systems) depends on the ability to stabilize the wavefront from a large segmented mirror such that optical path differences are limited to tens of picometers RMS during an exposure time of a few hours. In order to relax the constraints on the mechanical stability, ECLIPS will be equipped with a wavefront sensing and control (WS\&C) architecture to correct wavefront errors up to temporal frequencies $\gtrsim$1 Hz. These errors may be dominated by spacecraft structural dynamics exciting vibrations at the segmented primary mirror. In this work, we present detailed simulations of the WS\&C system within the ECLIPS instrument and the resulting contrast performance. This study assumes wavefront aberrations based on a finite element model of a simulated telescope with spacecraft structural dynamics. Wavefront residuals are then computed according to a model of the adaptive optics system that includes numerical propagation to simulate a realistic wavefront sensor and an analytical model of the temporal performance. An end-to-end numerical propagation model of ECLIPS is then used to estimate the residual starlight intensity distribution at the science detector. We show that the contrast performance depends strongly on the target star magnitude and the spatio-temporal distribution of wavefront errors from the telescope. In cases with significant vibration, we advocate for the use of laser metrology to mitigate high temporal frequency wavefront errors and increase the mission yield."

Often space observations are performed by continuously collecting data from an instrument aimed at nadir (e.g. directly below the space platform). However, if the platform has the ability to assess science utility of features being overflown, an intelligent measurement scheme can improve science return. This can be achieved by controlling the on/off state of the instrument if it is not able to continuously operate (e.g. due to energy or thermal constraints), and by allowing the instrument to view off nadir if it has pointing capabilities.In the case of SMICES, power constraints and the rarity of storms means that with blind nadir targeting SMICES would collect a limited amount of ice storm radar data. The algorithms proposed acquire measurements to maximize acquired high interest storms while concurrently collecting a background sampling of all features. We use a cloud classification system to identify five different cloud types. Six algorithms ranging from “blind” to more selective are described and results from evaluation on a dataset of 13 ground swaths covering 72,399,600 km2 of data are presented. This data is from high quality science simulations that contain all five cloud types and multiple storms. When utilizing the radiometer’s lookahead and the full range of the radar the results show a 23.7x and 1.9x increase over the base algorithm in the most and second most important cloud types respectively."

Much information on the composition and formation of exoplanets and circumstellar debris disks can only be achieved via direct imaging. Direct imaging is challenging because of the small angular separations (< 1 arcsec) and high star-to-planet ux ratios (?109 for a Jupiter analog or ?1010 for an Earth analog in the visible). Atmospheric turbulence prohibits reaching such high ux ratios on the ground, so observations must be made above the Earth's atmosphere. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman), set to launch in the mid-2020s, will be the ?rst space-based observatory to demonstrate high-contrast imaging with active wavefront control using its Coronagraph Instrument. The instrument's main purpose is to mature the various technologies needed for a future agship mission to image and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. These technologies include two high-actuator-count deformable mirrors, photon-counting detectors, two complementary wavefront sensing and control loops, and two di?erent coronagraph types. In this paper, we describe the complete set of ight coronagraph mask designs and their intended combinations in the Roman Coronagraph Instrument. There are three types of mask con?gurations included: a primary one designed to meet the instrument's top-level requirement, three that are supported on a best-e?ort basis, and several unsupported ones contributed by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program. The unsupported mask con?gurations could be commissioned and used if the instrument is approved for operations after its initial technology demonstration phase."

However, the accelerating dynamics of ice shelf melt in a warming environment are poorly understood, and the collapse of Antarctic ice shelves remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in global sea level rise projections. The cavities below Antarctic ice shelves are notoriously difficult to access, making model-based hypotheses about the relationship between ocean warming and greater ice shelf melting difficult to verify because of a lack of in-situ data to constrain model parameters and examine key assumptions. We present early progress on IceNode, a novel vehicle under development at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory designed to acquire well-distributed, concurrent, long-duration melt rate measurements under ice shelves. IceNodes are deployed as an array from a ship at the shelf edge, and use variable buoyancy to ride melt-driven exchange currents far into the cavity. Once underneath their target, they release a ballast weight to become highly positively buoyant and attach to the underside of the ice shelf, where they acquire in-situ measurements of basal melt rate directly at the ice-ocean interface for a year or more. Finally, IceNodes detach from their landing structure and use variable buoyancy to ride melt-driven exchange currents back to open water, where they surface and transmit their mission data home. IceNodes are designed to be relatively low-cost, expendable, and have simple logistics, enabling scientists to deploy scalable arrays that simultaneously measure co-varying ice shelf melt and ocean conditions over large spatial areas, thereby providing an unprecedented view of ice shelf melt rate variability and its drivers."

TRN pro-vides real-time, autonomous, map-relative position determination and generates a landing target based on a priori knowledge of hazards. The required performance for TRN was to land within 60m of the selected target. The required 60m was sub-allocated to various error sources in three major categories: targeting error, knowledge error, and control error. The targeting error is the error in selecting an appropriate landing target and the knowledge of the target on the surface. It includes the Lander Vision System (LVS) position localization with respect the ground, the synchronization between the Lander Vision System measurement and the main Navigation filter, and errors associated with the LVS Reference Map and Safe Target Selec-tion (STS). The knowledge error is the contribution of knowledge growth from the synchronization with LVS to touchdown. The control error encompasses how accurately the system could stay on the desired reference trajectory. The TRN error budget uses a combination of analysis, simulation, and hardware test-ing results to bound the various error contributions obtained during the verification and validation process. This paper first presents a description the TRN system, focusing on the architecture of LVS and STS. The paper then gives detailed overview of the TRN error budget, with a description of the major error contribu-tions in each of the three categories. Next, the paper gives the results for three versions of the error budget, pre-launch, in-flight pre-landing, and post-landing. The paper compares the pre-flight analysis, the pre-landing analysis using in-flight data during cruise, to the post-landing analysis of the TRN performance. Pre-landing analysis best estimate of the landing performance was 33m, compared to the 60m require-ment. Post-landing analysis estimated a landing accuracy of 8.53m or better, much better than the 33m pre-landing estimate. The actual post-landing imagery calculated the distance of the rover to the targeted location to be 5m. The post-landing analysis closely bounds the image-based assessment of landing accu-racy, indicating the success of the error budget architecture in bounding the landing accuracy, as well as the fidelity of the simulations used to model and predict performance."
