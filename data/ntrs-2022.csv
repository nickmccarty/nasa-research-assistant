The formation and evolution of Ganymede’s landforms highly depend on the nature of the icy materials as they present various thermal and rheological behaviors.  This chapter reviews the currently known thermodynamic parameters of the ice phases and hydrates reported on Ganymede, which seem to affect the evolution of the surface, using mainly results from the Voyager and Galileo missions"
1,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210016661,2023-08-03,Updated Assessment of Turboelectric Boundary Layer Ingestion Propulsion Applied to a Single-Aisle Commercial Transport,"Recent advances in technology and a push for more environmentally friendly air transportation has led to interest in electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP). EAP encompasses many different propulsion system architectures which can also enable new, synergistic propulsion-airframe integration approaches. This report evaluates the combination of turboelectric EAP and fuselage boundary layer ingestion (BLI) propulsion in a concept called “STARC-ABL.” The predicted fuel consumption benefits of STARC-ABL are updated from a prior 2016 study with new mission requirements and analysis methodologies. Additionally, certification noise is added to the concept evaluation. To properly assess the impact of EAP, a new concept, “ST-ABL,” is developed for comparison which includes the fuselage BLI propulsor driven mechanically instead of by a turboelectric system. STARC-ABL is predicted to provide a 3.4% reduction in fuel consumption for a single-aisle class, 3500 nmi design mission and a 2.7% reduction for a 900 nmi mission, both relative to an advanced technology conventional aircraft. STARC-ABL is also predicted to have a Chapter 14 cumulative noise margin of 7 EPNdB. The non-EAP ST-ABL concept results in slightly higher fuel consumption and noise than STARC-ABL, indicating that the turboelectric system provides benefits over the mechanical drive approach to fuselage BLI. Areas for future research and evolution of the concept include assessing its applicability to other aircraft sizes, increasing the fidelity of BLI and electric component modeling, and investigating other EAP architecture options."

This report presents the results of trade studies and concept development for the nuclear electric power system, consisting of the fission reactor, radiation shielding, power conversion, heat rejection, and power management and distribution (PMAD). The nuclear power team completed trade studies to evaluate different reactor and power conversion technologies and developed preliminary concepts for the crew shielding, waste heat radiators, and PMAD. The initial results suggest that a modified terrestrial microreactor combined with supercritical CO2 Brayton conversion could be used to perform the crew and cargo missions with satisfactory performance and modest risk. The report includes preliminary development strategies that could bring the NEP technology to fruition for Mars missions in the late 2030s or early 2040s."

Springtime heatwaves are becoming more common in the region, with statistically significant trends in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of heatwave events over the past four decades. Mechanisms by which the heatwaves occur and contributing factors differ by season. Winter heatwave frequency is correlated with the atmospheric circulation, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, while the frequency of heatwaves during the spring months is highly correlated with aspects of the land surface including snow cover, albedo, and latent heat flux. Idealized AMIP-style experiments are used to quantify the contribution of suppressed Arctic sea ice and snow cover over Siberia on the atmospheric circulation, surface energy budget, and surface air temperature in Siberia during the winter and spring of 2020. Sea ice concentration contributed to the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex and Arctic Oscillation during the winter months, thereby influencing the tropospheric circulation and surface air temperature over Siberia. Warm temperatures across the region resulted in an earlier-than-usual recession of the winter snowpack. The exposed land surface contributed to up to 20% of the temperature anomaly during the spring through the albedo feedback and changes in the ratio of the latent and sensible heat fluxes. This, in combination with favorable atmospheric circulation patterns, resulted in record-breaking heatwaves in Siberia in the spring of 2020."
4,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210019043,2023-08-03,NASA Ground-based Layered Pressure Vessels Materials Report,"A significant portion of Layered Pressure Vessels (LPVs) manufactured for NASA in the 1950s and ’60s are of non-code construction. These vessels were constructed to the standards of individual manufacturers rather than an industry or consensus standard and often contain legacy or proprietary materials, which have poor or no characterization. Obtaining correct material properties is the first step in assuring vessel safety and predicting life and critical failure modes before they happen. This report details the efforts of the LPV Project related to material properties and characterization. The goal in testing materials from deconstructed vessels was to provide material characterization utilizing modern test methods that would give a strong probabilistic base as an option for future analysis. ASTM E1820, Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fracture Toughness was used for fracture toughness; ASTM E1921, Standard Test Method for Determination of Reference Temperature, T0, for Ferritic Steels in the Transition Range for transition temperature; and ASTM E647, Standard Test Method for Measurement of Fatigue Crack Growth Rates for fatigue crack growth. Particular focus was placed on determination of transition temperature through evaluation of the T0 reference temperature in accordance with ASTM E1921. Transition temperature testing allows for a probabilistic analysis of vessel materials that may be operating at temperatures below the transition from ductile tearing to brittle cleavage failure. This test method was not available at the time of construction and has proved invaluable to the characterization of older ferritic steels. The values reported are specific to the largest body of materials found in the current NASA fleet, but do not claim to be all inclusive. As demonstrated in this report, some materials contain extreme lot-to-lot variability. In some cases, this can be comfortably bounded by worst case probabilistic methods, however it is always recommended that vessel specific data be collected in as much depth as possible to ensure correct assumptions and avoid unduly restricting vessel usage."

The headspace gas present over the solid samples within the sample tubes will be of significant scientific interest for what it reveals about the interactions of the solid samples with the trapped atmosphere and for what it will reveal about the martian atmosphere itself. However, establishing the composition of the martian atmosphere will require other dedicated samples. The headspace gas as the sole atmospheric sample is problematic for many reasons. The quantity of gas present within the sample tube volume is insufficient for many investigations, and there will be exchange between solid samples, headspace gas, and tube walls. Importantly, the sample tube materials and preparation were not designed for optimal Mars atmospheric gas collection and storage as they were not sent to Mars in a degassed evacuated state and have been exposed to both Earth's and Mars' atmospheres. Additionally, there is a risk of unconstrained seal leakage in transit back to Earth, which would allow fractionation of the sample (leak-out) and contamination (leak-in). The science return can be improved significantly (and, in some cases, dramatically) by adding one or more of several strategies listed here in increasing order of effectiveness and difficulty of implementation: (1) Having Perseverance collect a gas sample in an empty sample tube, (2) Collecting gas in a newly-designed, valved, sample-tube-sized vessel that is flown on either the Sample Fetch Rover (SFR) or the Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL), (3) Adding a larger (50-100 cc) dedicated gas sampling volume to the Orbiting Sample container (OS), (4) Adding a larger (50-100 cc) dedicated gas sampling volume to the OS that can be filled with compressed martian atmosphere."
6,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210020918,2023-08-03,A Deep Learning Approach to Fast Radiative Transfer,"Due to the sheer volume of data, leveraging satellite instrument observations effectively in a data assimilation context for numerical weather prediction or for remote sensing requires a radiative transfer model as an observation operator that is both fast and accurate at the same time. Physics-based line-by-line radiative transfer (RT) models fulfil the requirement for accuracy, but are too slow and too costly in computational terms for operational applications. Therefore, fast methods were developed to be able to perform fast RT calculations using techniques such as spectral sampling or pre-computed look-up tables. The operational fast models currently calculate the absorption and scattering coefficients from the pre-computed regression coefficients and atmospheric state and cloud profiles. As a novel solution to this problem, this work investigates a deep learning approach to replace the regression coefficients in the fast RT models. A selection of hidden-layer neural network configurations is trained against atmospheric transmittance profile data computed by an accurate line-by-line model and their performance is evaluated and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed."
7,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210021415,2023-08-03,Soil Respiration Phenology Improves Modeled Phase of Terrestrial Net Ecosystem Exchange in Northern Hemisphere,"In the northern hemisphere, terrestrial ecosystems transition from net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere in winter to net ecosystem carbon sinks during spring. The timing (or phase) of this transition, determined by the balance between ecosystem respiration (RECO) and primary production, is key to estimating the amplitude of the terrestrial carbon sink. We diagnose an apparent phase bias in the RECO and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) seasonal cycles estimated by the Terrestrial Carbon Flux (TCF) model framework and investigate its link to soil respiration mechanisms. Satellite observations of vegetation canopy conditions, surface meteorology, and soil moisture from the NASA SMAP Level 4 Soil Moisture product are used to model a daily carbon budget for a global network of eddy covariance flux towers. Proposed modifications to TCF include: the inhibition of foliar respiration in the light (the Kok effect); a seasonally varying litterfall phenology; an O2 diffusion limitation on heterotrophic respiration (RH); and a vertically resolved soil decomposition model. We find that RECO phase bias can result from bias in RECO magnitude and that mechanisms which reduce northern spring RECO, like substrate and O2 diffusion limitations, can mitigate the phase bias. A vertically resolved soil decomposition model mitigates this bias by temporally segmenting and lagging RH. Applying these model enhancements at Continuous Soil Respiration (COSORE) sites verifies their improvement of RECO and NEE skill compared to in situ observations (up to ∆RMSE = −0.76 g C m−2 d −1 35 ). Ultimately, these mechanisms can improve prior estimates of NEE for atmospheric inversion studies."
8,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210022214,2023-08-03,Identification of Best Practices for Predicting Inlet Performance Using FUN3D Part 2: Installed Inlets.,"A series of studies were performed to assess the impacts of boundary condition type and placement, grid reﬁnement, and modeling parameters such as turbulence model and ﬂux limiter on the predicted inlet performance for installed inlet conﬁgurations using the FUN3D ﬂow solver. Two conﬁgurations were considered for the study; a wall-mounted Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI) inlet and the C607 propulsion model tested in the 8x6 Supersonic Wind Tunnel at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The results of the studies were to be used to recommend best practices, as well as to assess the accuracy of FUN3D for inlet predictions. The results of BLI inlet stud-ies showed a minimal impact of grid reﬁnement on the predicted inlet performance for a constant mass ﬂow rate through the inlet. For the C607 propulsion model, the results showed that while the FUN3D predictions at the Aerodynamic Inter-face Plane (AIP) qualitatively agree with the experimental data, FUN3D showed a tendency to overpredict the circumferential distortion metric (IDCmax) and un-derpredict both the radial distortion metric (IDRmax) and the pressure recovery at the AIP (PRAIP ), with the diﬀerences between FUN3D and the experimental data increasing with increasing grid reﬁnement and Mach number. Additionally, the outﬂow boundary location studies performed for both geometries showed that the solution at the AIP was not signiﬁcantly impacted by the outﬂow boundary location as long as it was not placed at the location of the AIP. The modeling parameter studies did not indicate a path forward for improved predictions for either inlet con-ﬁguration. Finally, comparisons between the mass ﬂow plug and outﬂow geometry versions of the C607 propulsion model illustrated favorable agreement, which indi-cates that the diﬀerences observed are not caused by the outﬂow boundary model for this problem. This problem poses signiﬁcant challenges to Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers due to the presence of shocks and ﬂow separation in the inlet."
9,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210024128,2023-08-03,Lunar Simulant Deposition Technique for Dust Tolerance Studies,"A renewed interest in lunar exploration has spawned an array of development efforts for lunar surface assets. These systems depend on the reliable operation of mechanisms and components that may be susceptible to performance degradations or failure due to dust. The Uniform Dust Deposition System was developed at the NASA Glenn Research Center to provide repeatable, uniform, and automated deposition of simulants on surfaces of interest for dust mitigation testing. The system is capable of depositing simulants on test articles up to 60 cm in diameter and 15 cm high in a dry air environment with less than 1 percent relative humidity while keeping users safe from aerosolized dust. The automation of the system allows for
high testing throughput while not sacrificing test quality and allows the user to reduce data in parallel. The additional development of a simulant preparation technique complements the repeatability of the deposition physics during testing. The system includes an imaging subsystem that leverages the power of machine learning to count simulant particles and measure their size, thereby allowing for accurate predictions of
surface deposition densities (coefficient of determination R^(2) = 0.93) from images alone. The coverage of dust on a surface was shown to be uniform (coefficient of variation CV < 0.11), allowing developers to accurately evaluate the performance of their technology with a prescribed amount of lunar simulant, information that can be used to develop and refine models. The accuracy of the system is currently less than desired for a single deposition run, with a standard deviation (SD) ranging from 18 to 24 mg, or 0.839 to 1.184 mg/sq. cm , for a 5-cm-diameter area. However, the accuracy can be improved by performing multiple deposition runs to build dust to a desired level. Testing has shown that a SD of 0.2 to 0.6 mg, or 0.076 to 0.227 mg/sq. cm, can be achieved for a 5-cm-diameter area using this technique."

In this study we used human body modeling to predict unsuited astronaut kinematics and injury risk for piloted lunar launches and landings in the  standing posture. Three pulses (2-5 g; 10–150 ms rise times) were applied in 10 directions (vertical; ± 10-degree offsets) for a total of 30 simulations. Across all simulations, motion envelopes were computed to quantify displacement of the astronaut’s head (max 9.0 cm forward, 7.0 cm backward, 2.1 cm upward, 7.3 cm downward, 2.4 cm lateral) and arms (max 25 cm forward, 35 cm backward, 15 cm upward, 20 cm downward, 20 cm lateral). All head, neck, lumbar, and lower extremity injury metrics were within NASA’s tolerance limits, except tibia compression forces (0–1543 N upper tibia; 0–1482 N lower tibia; tolerance—1350 N) and revised tibia index (0.04–0.58 upper tibia; 0.03–0.48 lower tibia; tolerance—0.43) for the 2.7 g/150 ms pulse. Pulse magnitude and duration contributed over 80% to the injury metric values, whereas loading direction contributed less than 3%. Overall, these simulations suggest piloting a lunar lander vehicle in the standing posture presents a low risk of injury to the astronaut, although risk of tibia injury is potentially outside NASA’s acceptance limits and warrants further investigation."

However, all the past studies involved measurements of compressing flows. In order to study recombining flows, an expansion cone has been installed in the EAST facility. Four spectrometers are mounted at different axial positions of the cone to measure the evolution of the radiation during expansion. Quantitative data from optical emission spectroscopy will be used to get the densities of radiative species. These data are intended to be compared with simulations in order to improve the current models used by the entry community."
13,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210024834,2023-08-03,Transition Analysis for the CRM-NLF Wind Tunnel Configuration using Transport Equation Models and Linear Stability Correlations,"Transition models based on auxiliary transport equations augmenting the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework rely upon transition correlations that were derived from a limited number of low-speed experiments.  Furthermore, these models often account for only a subset of the relevant transition mechanisms and/or cannot accurately predict the sensitivity of those mechanisms to the changes in significant flow parameters. A preceding investigation had targeted the assessment of the transport-equation-based transition models in NASA's OVERFLOW 2.3b solver, namely, the amplification factor transport (AFT-2017b) equation model coupled with the Spalart-Allmaras RANS model and the Langtry-Menter transition models (LM2009 without crossflow effects and LM2015 including the modeling of crossflow transition) implemented with Menter’s shear-stress transport equation (SST2003) RANS model. Comparisons with recent measurements at transonic freestream conditions on the Common Research Model with Natural Laminar Flow (CRM-NLF) reinforced our earlier finding that all three of the above models significantly underpredict the reported extent of the laminar flow region over the entire span of the wing, regardless of the dominant instability mechanism(s) underlying the onset of the transition process. The underprediction of the laminar flow extent was attributed to the failure of the above models in accounting for the stabilizing effect of compressibility on the amplification of Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities. Based on previous linear stability studies related to compressibility effects, the present work proposes modifications to the two classes of transition models that reduce to the original form of each model at low subsonic speeds and do not require any nonlocal flow information or additional transport equation(s). The modifications are shown to significantly improve the predicted laminar extent of the flow and compare well against the data from the CRM-NLF experiment. Additionally, a previous assessment of transition prediction based on the dual, nonparallel <i>N</i>-factor method in conjunction with linear parabolized stability equations (PSE) is extended to additional angles of attack to provide the first comprehensive assessment of transition models based on nonparallel disturbance amplification over the CRM-NLF. In general, the transition criterion based on the dual, nonparallel N-factor method with <i>N<sub>TS</sub> = N<sub>CF</sub></i> = 6 is reasonably successful at correlating with the measured transition fronts at R<i><sub>eMAC</i></sub> = 15 million for all angles of attack investigated herein and provides additional validation of the improved predictions from the compressibility-corrected transition models."

A hybrid method is developed to calculate the intent conflict probability leveraging and extending past works on probabilistic conflict computation. Simulation results verify that the probabilistic intent model can accurately encompass the uncertain positions of each vehicle type, that are a result of wind prediction errors and vehicle performance. A comparison with past methods showed that the proposed hybrid method captures the intent conflict probability with better accuracy, especially for a larger look-ahead horizon, and computational time is reasonable for real-time applications. An example is presented to illustrate the use of the intent conflict probability in strategic planning applications."

The model geometry and conditions are selected to match experiments conducted in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Mach 6 Ludwieg Tube. Five nosetips of interest were selected for the computational studies herein: two sharp ogives, two blunt ogives, and one hemispherical nosetip. Computations are performed at a freestream Reynolds number of 7.01 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>. Each sharp and blunt tip ogives had a 14 and 28 degree version for the tip angles. A cylindrical section follows the nosetip, resulting in a meter long model such as in the experiments. The laminar flow solutions are analyzed. The boundary-layer-edge properties and the velocity and temperature profiles are compared across streamwise locations aft of the ogive-cylinder junction. The blunt nosetips induce an entropy layer that envelopes the boundary-layer profiles. Modal stability analysis identifies most amplified frequencies corresponding to Mack’s second modes that agree with experimental results for the sharp tips. Similar to the experimental measurements based on wall-mounted pressure sensors, no unstable modes are found for the blunt models. Nonmodal analysis revealed a broadband set of disturbances present for the blunter tips, in agreement with experimental observations. Flow perturbation contours of most amplified planar and oblique disturbances are shown to qualitatively match wind tunnel Schlieren images, with a switch from rope-like to elongated structures, i.e., from high frequency Mack’s second modes to low frequency Mack’s first modes, as the nosetip angle is increased for the sharp tip, and from boundary-layer to entropy-layer disturbances as the bluntness is increased."

19,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20210025470,2023-08-03,Adaptation to environmental extremes structures functional traits in biological soil crust and hypolithic microbial communities,"Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are widespread in drylands and deserts. At the microhabitat scale, they also host hypolithic communities that live under semi-translucent stones. Both environmental niches experience exposure to extreme conditions such as high UV radiation, desiccation, temperature fluctuations, and resource limitation. However, hypolithic communities are somewhat protected from extremes relative to biocrust communities. Conditions are otherwise similar, so comparing them can answer outstanding questions regarding adaptations to environmental extremes. Using metagenomic sequencing, we assessed the functional potential of dryland soil communities and identified the functional underpinnings of ecological niche differentiation in biocrusts versus hypoliths. We also determined the effect of the anchoring photoautotroph (moss or cyanobacteria). Genes and pathways differing in abundance between biocrusts and hypoliths indicate that biocrust communities adapt to the higher levels of UV radiation, desiccation, and temperature extremes through an increased ability to repair damaged DNA, sense and respond to environmental stimuli, and interact with other community members and the environment. Intracellular competition appears to be crucial to both communities, with biocrust communities waging war using the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) and hypoliths favoring diversity of antibiotics. The dominant primary producer had a reduced effect on community functional potential compared with niche, but an abundance of genes related to monosaccharide, amino acid, and osmoprotectant uptake in moss-dominated communities indicates reliance on resources provided to heterotrophs by mosses. Our findings indicate that functional traits in dryland communities are driven by adaptations to extremes and we identify strategies that likely enable survival in dryland ecosystems."

These systems included solar arrays and batteries and two radioisotope power system (RPS) options scaled down from previous designs. These are a half Stirling radioisotope generator and a one-eighth Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG). The COMPASS design consists of a soft-lander capable of network science (seismic, magnetospheric, laser reflector, and thermal transfer) that can land anywhere on the near side of the Moon and operate for at least six years. The baseline version, using only batteries and solar arrays, requires a very large battery (~80 kg) for the roughly 20 W night-time power requirements. The lander launch mass (with solid rocket breaking motor) is almost 900 kg. With such a large battery, the lander will require a launcher larger than the desired Minotaur V; a Taurus II (being developed for NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS)) or larger (Delta II or Atlas V) would be needed. The two RPS cases, half an Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators (ASRG) and one-eighth RTG have much smaller launch masses of 500 and 600 kg respectively. (The one-eighth RTG case lacks the power for the full science package, so a solar array battery is still needed.) Unfortunately, the Minotaur V’s launch capability is still not large enough (~430 kg to trans-lunar injection (TLI)) for the RPS systems. Consequently, a fourth case was developed to fly a limited science floor suite of instruments (seismometer only) which reduced the RPS Lander launch mass to fit on a Minotaur V."

The anticipated market growth is significant.  To unlock its scalability and incumbent benefits requires a human to oversee multiple flights simultaneously, focusing on multi-vehicle mission management and relinquishing to autonomous systems their active role in controlling the aircrafts’ flight paths. Key to the realization of these scalability benefits is minimally-encumbered access to the National Airspace System (NAS), which poses some unique challenges for self-piloted UAS aircraft operations.  These include the requirement for compatibility with existing airspace structures and operations including Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), neither of which were developed to accommodate the unique needs and capabilities of UAS.  

This paper explores the applicability of Digital Flight to the operations of self-piloted UAS.  As proposed by NASA, Digital Flight is a flight operations capability, enabled by a set of cooperative procedures and digital technologies, in which flight operators ensure flight-path safety through automated separation and flight path management in lieu of visual procedures and Air Traffic Control separation services.  Flights operating under potentially-forthcoming rules of Digital Flight employ advanced automation technologies, information sharing, connectivity to operational data, and cooperative behaviors through distributed decision-making to maintain safety and achieve mission objectives.  Designed for integration with VFR and IFR operations in shared NAS airspace, potentially as a third set of flight rules, Digital Flight may provide the mechanism for UAS operators – and all aircraft operators – to scale and diversify their operations beyond what is achievable under current regulations."

Though treatable, these zoonotic diseases are debilitating for under-resourced communities whose already close proximity to mosquito and sandfly vectors continues to increase via rapid urbanization and deforestation. Peru’s Ministries of Health (MINSA) and Environment (MINAM) are working to better understand the environmental factors amplifying the risk of dengue fever and leishmaniasis transmission. The first term of this project classified the land use and land cover of Madre de Dios’ 11 districts for 2010, 2015, and 2020 and identified a correlation between both diseases and urbanization. Our team expanded this analysis by creating urban-forest edge maps and incorporating climatic and topographic variables with data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). We determined these variables’ impacts on disease incidence by assessing existing literature and running regression models. Dengue fever correlated with urban-forest edge, urban area, slope, temperature, and precipitation. Leishmaniasis primarily correlated with forest-edge area and elevation, but lacking additional statistical significance prevented further work, a decision supported by the literature. Thus, the risk matrix and risk map which we scripted in R to visualize the risk of disease posed to districts alongside health post locations addresses only dengue fever. The results and products will inform MINSA and MINAM in public health interventions, resource distribution, and policy initiatives."

The NASA Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology project is developing UAM VTOL aircraft designs that can be used to focus and guide research activities in support of aircraft development for emerging aviation markets. These NASA concept vehicles encompass relevant UAM features and technologies, including propulsion architectures, highly efficient yet quiet rotors, and aircraft aerodynamic performance and interactions. The configurations adopted are generic, intentionally different in appearance and design detail from prominent industry arrangements. Already these UAM concept aircraft have been used in numerous engineering investigations, including work on meeting safety requirements, achieving good handling qualities, and reducing noise below helicopter certification levels. Focusing on the concept vehicles, observations are made regarding the engineering of Advanced Air Mobility aircraft."

However, given the size of most LV systems, free-free testing is a challenge and often not feasible. With this, a test stand, typically the launch pad itself, is introduced as the means of support. This shifts the challenge to developing robust numerical methods for removing the influence of the launch pad from the integrated system modal test. The Space Launch System (SLS) is no exception where the mobile launcher (ML) is used to support the vehicle for the integrated modal test (IMT). For the IMT, it is well understood from pre-test analysis with finite element models (FEMs) of the SLS and SLS coupled to ML that the ML has a significant influence on the SLS modal properties especially in the lower frequency range where the primary SLS bending modes exist. An accelerance decoupling (AD) method has been formulated for the purpose of “subtracting out” the influence of the ML from the IMT results. With AD, the SLS decoupled frequency response functions (FRFs) are directly extracted from the IMT FRFs. The subject approach is aimed to utilize measured data only and achieve a robust FRF decoupling scheme. AD is derived from a widely used coupling technique called “Receptance Coupling” (RC). The AD core equation reverses the RC process and utilizes a pair of auxiliary equations that enable the core equation to be resolved based on measured data only. In AD, the decoupled component FRFs are extracted from the coupled system FRFs with a transformation to remove the contribution of the “subtractive component”. This paper addresses the AD’s operational flexibility to resolve SLS free-free modal properties from coupled system measured data but also the possibility to include data from FEM if there is enough confidence in the FEM or if it is asserted that the effect to the final outcome is reasonable."

These prisms are typically used with lasers, but there are applications of their use with imaging systems.  One such example is that of a recently developed focusing schlieren system, where light must be transmitted through a Rochon prism in both the forward and backward directions.  Three Rochon prisms were characterized in this study in terms of their transmitted intensity and polarization state: a quartz/quartz prism, a glass/quartz prism, and a MgF2/MgF2 prism.  Laser testing at four wavelengths was performed, along with full clear aperture collimated LED light testing at a single wavelength.  The glass/quartz and MgF2/MgF2 prisms operated in the same manner when light was transmitted in either the forward or backward direction.  The quartz/quartz prism, however, exhibited differences between operation in the forward and backward direction.  In the forward orientation for input plane polarized light, the transmitted intensity varied sinusoidally as a function of height of incidence through the prism, while the polarization of the unrefracted and refracted beams were uniform and orthogonally polarized.  In the backward orientation, the intensity for both unrefracted and refracted beams was uniform, but the azimuthal orientation of the output plane polarized light varied sinusoidally as a function of height of incidence through the prism, while remaining orthogonally polarized between the two beams at each position."

Of particular note, LCF doesn’t need power hungry magnets, lasers, or particle beams.  Potentially, it could provide watts to hundreds of kilowatts of electrical power and process heat suitable for space power and high Isp nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) as well as distributed terrestrial power.

There is an urgent need to develop a landslide early warning system in the LMR. In collaboration with the Asian Disasters Preparedness Center and NASA’s SERVIR Programme, we are regionalizing the global Landslide Hazard Assessment System for Situational Awareness model for the LMR (LHASA-Mekong). A robust set of landslide inventories are needed to effectively train the machine learning-based LHASA-Mekong model. In this study, the Semi-Automatic Landslide Detection (SALaD) system was modified by incorporating a change detection module (SALaD-CD) to produce rainfall event-based landslide inventories using pre- and post-imagery from RapidEye and PlanetScope for various locations in the LMR that were identified based on media and government reports. These rainfall-induced landslides are published as initiation points for ease of use. In total, we created 22 inventories: 2 in Laos, 4 in Myanmar, 1 in Thailand and 15 in Vietnam. These inventories are being used to train the LHASA-Mekong model and quantify the effects of Land use/Land cover change on landslide susceptibility.

Because of these critical roles, today's climate models are continuously being developed and evaluated using constraining observations and measurements obtained by satellites, airborne, and ground-based instruments. Instrument simulators can provide a bridge between the measured or retrieved quantities and their sampling in models and field observations while considering instrument sensitivity limitations. Here we present the Earth Model Column Collaboratory (EMC2), an open-source ground-based lidar and radar instrument simulator and subcolumn generator, specifically designed for large-scale models, in particular climate models, but also applicable to high-resolution model output. EMC2 provides a flexible framework enabling direct comparison of model output with ground-based observations, including generation of subcolumns that may statistically represent finer model spatial resolutions. In addition, EMC2 emulates ground-based (and air- or space-borne) measurements while remaining faithful to large-scale models' physical assumptions implemented in their cloud or radiation schemes. The simulator uses either single particle or bulk particle size distribution lookup tables, depending on the selected scheme approach, to perform the forward calculations. To facilitate model evaluation, EMC2 also includes three hydrometeor classification methods, namely, radar- and sounding-based cloud and precipitation detection and classification, lidar-based phase classification, and a Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Observational Simulator Package (COSP) lidar simulator emulator. The software is written in Python, is easy to use, and can be straightforwardly customized for different models, radars, and lidars.

Following the description of the logic, functionality, features, and software structure of EMC2, we present a case study of highly supercooled mixed-phase cloud based on measurements from the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE). We compare observations with the application of EMC2 to outputs from four configurations of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) climate model (ModelE3) in single-column model (SCM) mode and from a large-eddy simulation (LES) model. We show that two of the four ModelE3 configurations can form and maintain highly supercooled precipitating cloud for several hours, consistent with observations and LES. While our focus is on one of these ModelE3 configurations, which performed slightly better in this case study, both of these configurations and the LES results post-processed with EMC2 generally provide reasonable agreement with observed lidar and radar variables. As briefly demonstrated here, EMC2 can provide a lightweight and flexible framework for comparing the results of both large-scale and high-resolution models directly with observations, with relatively little overhead and multiple options for achieving consistency with model microphysical or radiation scheme physics."

Furthermore, current climate models must parameterize both the microphysical and the cumulus convection processes, but this is usually implemented separately, whereas in nature there is a strong coupling between them. As a first step to improve our understanding of these two problems, we investigate how aerosol concentrations modify key properties of updrafts in eight large-eddy-permitting regional simulations of a case study of scattered convection over Houston, Texas, in which convection is explicitly simulated and microphysical processes are parameterized. Dynamical and liquid-phase microphysical responses are investigated using the following two different reference frames: static cloudy updraft grid cells versus tracked cumulus thermals. In both frameworks, we observe the expected microphysical responses to higher aerosol concentrations, such as higher cloud number concentrations and lower rain number concentrations. In terms of the dynamical responses, both frameworks indicate weak impacts of varying aerosol concentrations relative to the noise between simulations over the observationally derived range of aerosol variability for this case study. On the other hand, results suggest that thermals are more selective than cloudy updraft grid cells in terms of sampling the most active convective air masses. For instance, vertical velocity from thermals is significantly higher at upper levels than when sampled from cloudy updraft grid points, and several microphysical variables have higher average values in the cumulus thermal framework than in the cloudy updraft framework. In addition, the thermal analysis is seen to add rich quantitative information about the rates and covariability of microphysical processes spatially and throughout tracked thermal lifecycles, which can serve as a stronger foundation for improving subgrid-scale parameterizations."
42,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220000348,2023-08-03,Trajectory Specification Applied to Terminal Airspace,"Despite major efforts to automate air traffic control (ATC), it is still performed by humans today. The complexity and safety-criticality of ATC makes it very difficult to safely automate, but it must be automated to increase airspace capacity (the density of traffic that can be safely managed) and airport throughput (the number of arrivals and departures that an airport can safely handle in a given period of time) beyond what is possible with human controllers.

This paper presents the Trajectory Specification (TS) concept, which can help to safely automate ATC. TS is a method of specifying aircraft trajectories such that the position at any given time in flight is restricted to a precisely defined bounding space, removing all ambiguity as to where the flight is allowed to be. The bounding space or volume is determined by tolerances relative to a reference trajectory (position as a function of time). The tolerances are dynamic and are based on the aircraft navigation capabilities and the traffic situation. The tolerances can be a piecewise linear function of time or distance along the route, allowing the tolerances to vary as needed, typically increasing with time for departures and decreasing for arrivals.

A Trajectory Specification Language (TSL) is proposed for communicating trajectories from aircraft to ATC as requests and from ATC to aircraft as assignments. The TS concept requires a new generation of airborne Flight Management Systems (FMS) that understand the TSL and can fly the assigned trajectories, but this paper focuses on the ATC functions and the prototype ATC algorithms and software that were developed to test the TS concept.

Assuming conformance, TS can guarantee safe separation for an arbitrary length of time even in the event of an ATC system or communication outage. It can help to achieve the high level of safety and reliability needed for ATC automation, and it can also reduce the reliance on ATC backup systems for tactical conflict detection and resolution during normal operation.

TS can be applied to any controlled airspace, including enroute, terminal, and urban airspace, but this paper presents algorithms and software for arrival spacing and conflict detection and resolution in the terminal airspace serving a major airport. In a fast-time simulation of a full day of traffic in a major terminal airspace, all conflicts were resolved in near real time, demonstrating the computational feasibility and the preliminary operational feasibility of the TS concept.

This paper is a compilation of previous papers, and it adds significant information that was omitted from those papers due to length limitations. It also updates some of the results of those earlier papers due to algorithm refinements and corrections of minor software errors."

However, use of modeling outputs in decision-making remains uncommon. We share insights from a multidisciplinary National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center working group on technical, communication, and process-related factors that facilitate or hamper uptake of model results. We emphasize that it is not simply technical model improvements, but active and iterative stakeholder involvement that can lead to more impactful outcomes. In particular, trust- and relationship-building with decision-makers are key for knowledge-based decision making. In this respect, nurturing knowledge exchange on the interpersonal (e.g., through participatory processes), and institutional level (e.g., through science-policy interfaces across scales), represent promising approaches. To this end, we offer a generalized approach for linking modeling and decision-making."

In this study, we use a series of 3D hybrid particle-in-cell simulations to model the response of the lunar wake to a passing coronal mass ejection (CME). Average plasma parameters are derived from the Wind spacecraft located at 1 au during three distinct phases of a passing halo (Earth-directed) CME on 2015 June 22. Each set of plasma parameters, representing the shock/plasma sheath, a magnetic cloud, and plasma conditions we call the mid-CME phase, are used as the time-static upstream boundary conditions for three separate simulations. These simulation results are then compared with results that use nominal solar wind conditions. Results show a shortened plasma void compared to nominal conditions and a distinctive rarefaction cone originating from the terminator during the CME's plasma sheath phase, while a highly elongated plasma void reforms during the magnetic cloud and mid-CME phases. Developments of electric and magnetic field intensification are also observed during the plasma sheath phase along the central wake, while electrostatic turbulence dominates along the plasma void boundaries and 2–3 lunar radii RM downstream in the central wake during the magnetic cloud and mid-CME phases. The simulations demonstrate that the lunar wake responds in a dynamic way with the changes in the upstream solar wind during a CME."

While the primary purpose of lunar observations in MODIS and VIIRS is radiometric calibration, these observations have been leveraged for other sensor performance assessments such as spatial registration and deriving the modulation transfer function (MTF). In this work, we will derive the lunar MTF using a knife edge approach similar to previous work. However, to further isolate the edge of the lunar disk when deriving the edge spread function (ESF), we will apply a lunar surface variation correction using a model based on data obtained by the Spectral Profiler (SP) on board the SELENE spacecraft. This model was provided to us by AIST in Japan. To align the measured and modeled data, we developed techniques for projecting the measured lunar surface pixels onto the radiance maps produced by the SP model. We correct the lunar surface variation while preserving the signal of the lunar disk edge in the ESF, and then calculate the MTF results using standard techniques. These results are in good agreement with previously published results from both Moon-based observations in MODIS and VIIRS and from the spectroradiometric calibration assembly (SRCA) on MODIS. With the exception of MODIS bands 1 and 2, the MTF is stable on orbit for the reflective bands in both instruments."

In addition, a new data quality-control tool was developed for the Dobson automation software (WinDobson). This paper presents a comparison of Dobson Umkehr ozone profiles from NOAA ozone network stations (Boulder, OHP, MLO, Lauder) against several satellite records, including Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS; ver. 4.2), and combined SBUV and OMPS records (NASA AGG and NOAA COH). A subset of satellite data is selected to match Dobson Umkehr observations at each station spatially (distance less than 200 km) and temporally (within 24 hours). Umkehr Averaging Kernels (AKs) are applied to vertically smooth all overpass satellite profiles prior to comparisons. The station Umkehr record consists  of several instrumental records, which have different optical characterizations, and thus instrument-specific stray light contributes to the data processing errors and creates step changes in the record. This work evaluates the overall quality of Umkehr long-term measurements at NOAA ground-based stations and assesses the impact of the instrumental changes on the stability of the Umkehr ozone profile record. This paper describes a method designed to correct biases and discontinuities in the retrieved Umkehr profile that originate from the Dobson calibration process, repair, or optical realignment of the instrument. The M2GMI and GMI CTM ozone profile model output matched to station location and date of observation is used to evaluate instrumental step changes in the Umkehr record. Homogenization of the Umkehr record and discussion of the apparent stray light error in retrieved ozone profiles are the focus of this paper. Homogenization of ground-based records is of great importance for studies of long-term ozone trends and climate change."

Hot-fire testing is generally much more accurate, but is often burdensome, costly, and requires long lead times due to design work, infrastructure preparation, etc. Cold-flow testing is much less expensive and has a rapid turnaround time, but conventional simulants (e.g., nitrogen, steam) used in cold-flow testing yield less accurate results (i.e., results that are not sufficiently representative of test article performance). While researching methods to optimize such tradeoffs, engineers at NASA’s Stennis Space Center discovered that ethane can be tuned to approximate rocket exhaust plumes generated by several common rocket propellants. This led NASA to develop the HYdrocarbon Propellants Enabling Reproduction of Flows in Rocket Engines (HYPERFIRE), a sub-scale, non-reacting flow test system. HYPERFIRE uses heated ethane to enable physical simulation of rocket engines powered by a broad range of propellants in an inexpensive, accurate, and simple fashion."

expulsion of chemical “fuels” carried on board, with performance governed by the rocket equation. These chemicals produced energy, and after combustion, constituted the propulsive mass/momentum. The best such chemicals in terms of Isp that are deemed safe engineering/mission wise are hydrogen and oxygen, producing some 450 seconds of Isp. There are more reactive chemicals, such as fluorine, which have higher Isp, but also have serious safety issues. Propulsion in atmospheres can ingest atmospheric constituents (aka “airbreathing propulsion”) which provide additional propulsive mass when heated and a component of the combustion/energy generation process. This utilization of non-stored/carried propulsive mass provides partial separation of propulsive mass and energy and produces higher Isp. The other approach to separating propulsive mass and energy is to, either on board or added from offboard, supply additional energy, such as from nuclear or solar sources. This is the approach for fission nuclear thermal and electric propulsion, which can provide an Isp in excess of 800 seconds of Isp. Other processes or in addition to thermal expansion, such as electro-magnetics, can be employed to increase exit velocity and Isp. Separating propulsive mass and energy for space faring is commonly referred to as a means to circumvent the rocket equation and is capable of producing major benefits for the development of commercial deep space and space faring in general including affordable fast transits to mitigate the human health impacts of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and microG. 

The key to higher than chemical Isp, beyond H2-O2, and beyond the radiated energy and systems limitations of solar for space faring, is a light weight, high energy density source, either on board or via utilization of energy beaming to the vehicle. Traditional energy sources include chemical, heat, electrics, mechanical, photons, and nuclear. Propulsive mass can be carried on board, sourced beyond the surface of Earth via in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and includes harvesting from atmospheres. High Isp via electromagnetic related propulsive mass acceleration requires sufficient ionization and conductivity. The major metrics for space propulsion are costs, safety, Isp, weight, and thrust level, the latter dependent upon mission requirements. High thrust for human missions is needed to reduce time exposed to radiation and microG and high thrust is required for space access. Costs of space access are reducing via reusability, printing manufacture, and robotization of manufacturing and operation. Chemical rockets provide high thrust from the expansion of the heated mass constituents at high mass flow. The other high thrust propulsion approach is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which, in addition to high thrust, has a high Isp of over 2,000 seconds of Isp. The VASIMIR engine offers some 5,000 seconds of Isp at high thrust [ref. 3]. Electric propulsion cycles are capable of Isp much higher than that but at low thrust levels using available energy sources. With cost as a major metric, reusable rockets and improved manufacturing and operations are rapidly greatly lowering the costs of space access, which could provide/supply in space fuel depots and affordable chemical propulsion for the desired human fast transits (e.g., some 200-day round trips to Mars). The other option for fast transits is VASIMIR, given a nuclear on-board energy source that has the requisite many megawatts of power and an alpha, kgs of weight/kW of energy produced, on the order of one (i.e., a light weight, high energy density energy source). 

The purpose of this report is to examine the options beyond traditional rocket engines, where
propulsive mass and energy are combined, specifically the separation of propulsive mass and energy. This report considers the spectrum of advanced energetics, sources of propulsive mass, conductivity enhancement approaches, energy beaming possibilities, and candidate propulsion cycles. Suggestions are made for various combinatorial, system level, beyond traditional combustion rocket, space propulsion approaches for human deep space missions given the changing conditions of increased knowledge of deep space resources for ISRU, revolutionary energetics, and technology advancements writ large."

They have been observed within the percolation facies of glaciated regions experiencing intense seasonal surface melting and high snow accumulation. Widespread perennial firn aquifers have been identified within the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) via field expeditions, airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys, and satellite microwave sensors. In contrast, ice slabs are nearly continuous ice layers that can also form on spatial scales as large as tens of kilometers as a result of surface and subsurface water-saturated snow and firn layers sequentially refreezing following multiple melting seasons. They have been observed within the percolation facies of glaciated regions experiencing intense seasonal surface melting but in areas where snow accumulation is at least 25 % lower as compared to perennial firn aquifer areas. Widespread ice slabs have recently been identified within the GrIS via field expeditions and airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys, specifically in areas where perennial firn aquifers typically do not form. However, ice slabs have yet to be identified from space. Together, these two ice sheet features represent distinct, but related, sub-facies within the broader percolation facies of the GrIS that can be defined primarily by differences in snow accumulation, which influences the englacial hydrology and thermal characteristics of firn layers at depth.

Here, for the first time, we use enhanced-resolution vertically polarized L-band brightness temperature () imagery (2015–2019) generated using observations collected over the GrIS by NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite to map perennial firn aquifer and ice slab areas together as a continuous englacial hydrological system. We use an empirical algorithm previously developed to map the extent of Greenland's perennial firn aquifers via fitting exponentially decreasing temporal L-band signatures to a set of sigmoidal curves. This algorithm is recalibrated to also map the extent of ice slab areas using airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys collected by NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB) campaigns (2010–2017). Our SMAP-derived maps show that between 2015 and 2019, perennial firn aquifer areas extended over 64 000 km2, and ice slab areas extended over 76 000 km2. Combined together, these sub-facies are the equivalent of 24 % of the percolation facies of the GrIS. As Greenland's climate continues to warm, seasonal surface melting will increase in extent, intensity, and duration. Quantifying the possible rapid expansion of these sub-facies using satellite L-band microwave radiometry has significant implications for understanding ice-sheet-wide variability in englacial hydrology that may drive meltwater-induced hydrofracturing and accelerated ice flow as well as high-elevation meltwater runoff that can impact the mass balance and stability of the GrIS."

characteristic temporal and spatial scales of the turbulence are comparable to those of the instability. Therefore,
turbulence may violate the common assumption of a uniform and stationary background used to describe
instabilities and make the properties of the instabilities different. To investigate this effect, we perform threedimensional
hybrid simulations with particle-in-cell ions and a quasi-neutralizing electron fluid. We find that the
turbulence significantly reduces the growth rates and saturation levels of both instabilities. Comparing the cases
with and without turbulence, the former results in a higher temperature anisotropy in the asymptotic marginally
stable state at large times. In the former case, the distribution function averaged over the simulation box is also
closer to the initial one."

However, these communication products can also be further enhanced for the benefit of the blind and deaf communities. While such products may already be readily available, such projects are not easily accessible to blind and/or deaf certified educators, which often rely on making their own resources or do not have the funds to provide such resources (e.g., cost of 3D printers or cost of braille books). The planetary science community can have better practices to reach these broader audiences. Best practices can include transcripts from podcasts, transcripts in videos, and large-font captions. Images on websites and social media accounts should also include alt-text descriptive captions. 3D printing can also enhance planetary science for the blind community, through tactile posters, maps, and pamphlets. Planetary data can also be augmented by providing different tactile geological maps (e.g., topography or various datasets), and audio-visual videos freely available for educators.
Visual Engagement: Visual engagement consists of several avenues to consider, the three main themes includes: 1) swag; 2) videos; 3) interactive exploration. Swag can include the fun visual take-home materials, such as stickers, posters, bookmarks, etc. Videos can include educational-specific videos (available freely via YouTube or by other educational-specific streaming avenues, such as Nebula or Curiosity Stream), provided they have Closed Captioning (CC). The use of QR codes to such videos or websites can also benefit to being added on swag.
Interactive exploration can also be sub-divided by different types of engagement. A popular and still fairly new technology for public engagement is the use of virtual reality (VR). While this has been mainly for martian and lunar surface exploration [1], the deaf communities can benefit from VR through a more extensive look at our solar system and beyond (for example, a VR experience of the flight path, or visual map of the heliosphere/dynamics of our Sun).
Audio Engagement: Audio tools can also be a useful avenue of communication, especially for the blind communities. Audio archiving can certainly be transcripts from the video engagements, but also the use of podcasts can also be a benefit. Podcasting can take on two forms: 1) interview engagement; and 2) update engagement. For interviews, scientists can communicate with STEM-specific podcast platforms to make other listener-bases aware of what is going on with a specific mission. For update-type communication, missions may opt to have an archived podcast of news, updates, and the teams involved. The most important aspect of such podcasts would be for the need of complimentary transcripts (including descriptive transcripts if sounds are included), and the limited use of jargon.
Research Engagement: There have been several examples of involving the blind and low-vision communities in citizen science, such as through the NASA Heliophysics division. Examples include the NASA PUNCH (Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere) mission led by the Southwest Research Institute [2], which include blind and visually-impaired citizens to assist in the Sun’s coronal rhythms.” Another example is the Eclipse Soundscapes: Citizen Science Project (ES:CSP), which documents observations of acoustical changes of nature and ecosystems during solar eclipse events [3].
Inclusivity: A major theme that is necessary for public engagement is inclusivity and the awareness of reaching broader audiences. Outreach to include hearing/seeing impaired communities are still lacking in the sciences. There are several opportunities that the planetary sciences could take. Other projects that have emerged from the space sciences include adding transcripts to visual engagement [4], and the use of 3D printing for the visually-impaired [5].

These traps serve to protect the pumping function of the cooling loops by eliminating free gas that would otherwise impact the impellers and cause a loop shutdown. Gas Trap Plug Assemblies (GTPAs) have been designed, manufactured and tested, to permit function of the IATCS in the event of a loss of cabin atmosphere and long term decrew event. The GTPA also serve to give the crew additional time to evacuate the United States Operating Segment (USOS) in the unlikely event of an Ammonia breach of an Interface Heat Exchanger (IFHX). These GTPAs have been installed on the ISS IATCS since May 2019. This paper will address purpose, design and testing of the GTPA.

It is implemented as an object-oriented Fortran library, enabling flexible code development and optimal runtime performance on clusters. The downsides of the Fortran interface are a steep learning curve for students and the reduced productivity of users that is typical for static compiled languages, in contrast to dynamic interpreted languages like Python. pyCRTM is a new software framework that directly interfaces the CRTM Fortran data structures and procedures in Python, leveraging both the simplicity and ease of use of Python syntax as well as the flexibility arising from the vast contemporary Python ecosystem. The goal of pyCRTM is to lower the barrier of entry for university students to learn and use the CRTM and to boost the productivity of researchers seeking to create new methods in radiative transfer and data assimilation, or seeking to apply the CRTM to study atmospheric phenomena without having to go through the pre-existing complexity of the CRTM Fortran interface."

The spread of these impacts can lead to potentially existential consequences and system collapse across a range of time horizons. Globalization contributes to systemic risk affecting people worldwide. The impacts of climate change or COVID-19 show how the challenges of addressing systemic risk go beyond conventional risk management and governance. Critical system interdependencies, amplified by underlying vulnerabilities, highlight that there is a growing need to better understand cascading impacts, systemic risks and the possible political (governance) and societal responses. This includes improving our understanding of the root causes of systemic risk, both biophysical and socio-economic, and related information needs. Addressing contemporary challenges in terms of systemic risk requires integrating different systems perspectives and fostering system thinking, while implementing key intergovernmental agendas, such as the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals."

This process enables production of cones, domes, or caps that can incorporate features such as flat bulkheads. Friction stir welded (FSW) Al-Li 2195 blanks have been spin formed for single-piece, launch vehicle domes up to 5 m in diameter. Al-Li 2050 plate has the advantage of availability up to 165 mm thick,whereas 2195 plate is traditionally only available up to 57 mm thick. Increased plate thickness enables greater design flexibility for machining of taller structural elements, such as stiffeners.  However, 2050 is only available in plate widths up to ~3.9 m.

This study demonstrated the capability of making custom 2050 blanks for spin forming large (>7.8 m in diameter), single-piece, light-weight flight articles (e.g., lunar habitats and landers) by FSW two (or more) plates together. Spin forming of welded 2050 blanks has not been attempted before this investigation. The objective was to evaluate the mechanical properties of 2050 parent material and FSW regions after spin forming and subsequent T6 heat treatment. A 3 m diameter x 38 mm thick 2050 blank was fabricated from two 1.5 m wide pieces by FSW and subsequently spin formed into a cone article. Additionally, three 1.2 m diameter x 8.1 mm thick 2050 blanks were produced by FSW and spin formed into subscale cone articles with varying strain input. Mechanical properties are reported for spin formed 2050-T6 parent material and FSW regions on the articles. Abnormal grain growth (AGG) in the FSW during heat treatment was expected based on prior experience with 2195. Implementation of an AGG suppression strategy during heat treatment reduced AGG in the FSW regions and improved ductility."

To accurately predict the future state of any system, it is required to possess knowledge of its current health state and future operational conditions. Present achievements of data-driven algorithms in regression of complex nonlinear functions and classification tasks have generated a growing interest in artificial intelligence for industrial applications. Complex multi-physics models as well as digital twins, once purely built on physics and corresponding simplified lumped parameter iterations, can now benefit from machine learning algorithms to mitigate the lack of understanding of some complex behavior. 

Given models of the current and future system behavior, a general approach of model-based prognostics can solve the prediction problem and further decision-making. In principle, data-driven approaches can replace expensive experimental test-setups as well as reduce the number of simulations needed to explore, e.g., the parametric space of a multi-parameter model. Nonetheless, the limitations of pure data-driven methods came to light rather quickly, at least for some industries. In many industrial applications, data acquisition is costly, and the volume of data that can be collected does not satisfy the requirements for effective model training and cross-validation. Therefore, some recent works in the area of machine learning is focusing on blending physics with data-driven algorithms, thus mitigating the drawbacks of the two approaches and emphasizing respective advantages. Partial physical knowledge of the problem can aid the learning process by “guiding” the algorithm towards efficient solutions that satisfy the physics driving the system behavior. The result is a hybrid modeling approach combining physical knowledge as well data-driven methods to develop a unified hybrid approach.

A hybrid framework for fusing information from physics-based performance models along with deep learning algorithms for prognostics of complex safety-critical systems is presented. In this framework, physics-based performance models infer unobservable model parameters related to the system's components health solving a calibration problem in the deep learning approach."

Accurate measurements of the temperature combined with thermal models are needed to better understand and control the thermal history to optimize mechanical properties. In order to calibrate and validate models, experimental temperature data must
be accurately measured in a rapid fashion due to the high speeds of the laser. In this work, a novel method to read data from thermocouples is created with enhanced circuitry that achieves a sampling rate of 10 kHz. This data acquisition rate allows for high precision sampling of SLM heating and cooling cycles."

Therefore, we sought to create our own CE tool. Changes in agency policy during the performance period allowed us to shift direction and instead adapt our previous legacy tool (Atlas) to include the collaboration features we sorely needed. Atlas relied upon databases for its back-end data management. Poseidon, the work proposed under this effort, was also intended to leverage from that previous back end (in part). However, in May 2021, EUSO announced that “SBU/CUI Information Can Now Be Shared/Stored Within O365 Without Encryption.”  Consequently, we made the decision to use O365 in place of our back end.  This change provides for version history, collaborative simultaneous editing, and other collaboration tools agency-wide that were previously unavailable with the old database architecture. 
The new Atlas O365 has more flexibility and capability for users.  It’s now easier for users to switch between using the tool for concurrent engineering and individual subsystem engineering. A version was delivered for concurrent engineering of small satellite missions; so far, it has been used successfully on the Aeolus MDC study. Atlas O365 will facilitate the design and assessment of Small Satellite Missions at low Concept Maturity Level at Ames. Feasibility assessments on mission concepts still at a low CML permit strategic planning and decision-making efforts at the center level about which concepts should be pursued and proposed."

In both models, under abrupt CO2 forcing, we find an asymmetric response in surface temperature and SG. The surface global warming at 8×CO2 is more than one third larger than the corresponding cooling at 1/8×CO2, and SG is CO2 dependent, increasing non-monotonically from 1/8×CO2 to 8×CO2. We find similar CO2 dependence in the transient runs, forced with -1%yr−1CO2 and +1%yr−1CO2 up to 1/8×CO2 and 8×CO2, respectively. The non-logarithmic radiative forcing – not the changing feedbacks – primarily explains the dependence of SG on CO2, particularly at low CO2 levels. The changing feedbacks, however, explain SG’s non-monotonic behavior."

Here we present a cross-instrument comparison of data acquired by MapCam and 24 OVIRS, including methods and results for all global and site-specific observation campaigns in which both 25 instruments were active. In our analysis, we consider both the absolute radiometric offset and the relative 26 (normalized) variation between the two instruments; we find that both depend strongly on the photometric and 27 instrumental conditions during the observation. The two instruments have a large absolute offset (>15%) due to their 28 independent radiometric calibrations. However, they are very consistent (relative offset as low as 1%) when each 29 instrument’s response is normalized at a single wavelength, particularly at low phase angles where shadows on 30 Bennu’s rough surface are minimized. We recommend using the global datasets acquired at 12:30 pm local solar 31 time for cross-comparisons; data acquired at higher phase angles have larger uncertainties."

Remotely-sensed snow observations can be used to retrieve snow mass or integrated into a snow model estimate; however, optimally leveraging remote sensing observations of snow is challenging. One reason is that no single sensor can accurately measure all types of snow because each type of sensor has its own unique limitations. Another reason is that remote sensing data is inherently discontinuous across time and space, and that the revisit cycle of remote sensing observations may not meet the requirements of a given snow applications. In order to quantify the feasible availability of remotely-sensed observations across space and time, this study simulates the sensor coverage for a suite of hypothetical snow sensors as a function of different orbital configurations and sensor properties. The information gleaned from this analysis coupled with a dynamic snow binary map is used to evaluate the efficiency of a single sensor (or constellation) to observe terrestrial snow on a global scale. The results show the efficacy achievable by different sensors over different snow types. The combination of different orbital and sensor configurations is explored to requirements of remote sensing missions that have 1-day, 3-day, or 30-day repeat intervals. The simulation results suggest that 1100 km, 550 km, and 200 km are the minimum required swath width for a polar-orbiting sensor to meet snow-related applications demanding a 1-day, 3-day, and 30-day repeat cycles, respectively. The results of this paper provide valuable input for the planning of a future global snow mission."

However, the complex shape of its CO emission lines, as well as uncertainties in the coma structure and excitation, has lead to ambiguities in the total CO production rate. We performed high-resolution, spatially, spectrally, and temporally resolved CO observations using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and Submillimeter Array to elucidate the outgassing behavior of C/2016 R2. Results are analyzed using a new, time-dependent, three-dimensional radiative transfer code (SUBlimating gases in LIME; SUBLIME, based on the open-source version of the LIne Modeling Engine), incorporating for the first time, accurate state-to-state collisional rate coefficients for the CO–CO system. The total CO production rate was found to be in the range of (3.8 − 7.6) × 10^(28) per s between 2018 January 13 and February 1 (at r(H) = 2.8–2.9 au), with a mean value of (5.3 ± 0.6) × 10^(28) per s. The emission is concentrated in a near-sunward jet, with a half-opening angle of ∼62° and an outflow velocity of 0.51 ± 0.01 km/s, compared to 0.25 ± 0.01 km/s in the ambient (and nightside) coma. Evidence was also found for an extended source of CO emission, possibly due to icy grain sublimation around 1.2 × 10^(5) km from the nucleus. Based on the coma molecular abundances, we propose that the nucleus ices of C/2016 R2 can be divided into a rapidly sublimating apolar phase, rich in CO, CO2, N2, and CH3OH, and a predominantly frozen (or less abundant), polar phase containing more H2O, CH4, H2CO, and HCN."

Many applications require absolute localization in a known reference frame, such as the execution of waypoint trajectories defined by human
operators. Classical geometric methods build a map of point features, which may not be able to be associated after lighting or
environmental changes. By contrast, semantics remain invariant to changes up to the robustness of the detection algorithm
and motion of the semantic objects. In this work, we describe our approaches for both offline semantic map generation as
well as online localization against a semantic map, intended to run in real-time on the robot. We additionally demonstrate
how our semantic localizer outperforms image-feature matching in some cases, and show the robustness of the algorithm to
environmental changes. Crucially, we show in our experiments that when semantics are used to supplement point features,
localization is always improved. To our knowledge, these experiments demonstrate the first use of learned semantics for
localization on a free-flying robot in microgravity."

However, despite the substantial advances, the current results of 3D MHD simulations are still far from reproducing helioseismic inferences and surface observations. The reason is the multi-scale nature of the solar dynamics, covering a vast range of scales, which can-not be solved with the current computational resources. In such a situation, significant progress has been achieved by the mean-field approach, based on the separation of small-scale turbulence and large-scale dynamics. The mean-field simulations can reproduce solar observations, qualitatively and quantitatively, and uncover new phenomena.

Thus, developing a synergy of these approaches seems to be a necessary but very challenging task."

The experiments were performed as part of the Mission Sequence Testing of the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment’s (FBCE) Flow Boiling Module (FBM) in the vertical upflow configuration in Earth gravity using the same experimental system that was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in August 2021. The operating parameters varied are heating configuration (single- and double-sided), mass velocity (380 – 2400 kg/m2s), inlet quality (0.011 – 0.519), and inlet pressure (120 – 179 kPa). High-speed video photographs are presented to explain the two-phase flow patterns within the channel’s heated length. Flow patterns are constituted by low-density and high-density fronts moving along the channel, with the high-density fronts gradually reducing in length due to evaporation. Heat transfer results in terms of flow boiling curves, streamwise wall temperature profiles, streamwise heat transfer coefficient profiles, and average heat transfer coefficients are presented and trends discussed. CHF data from the present experiments are combined with prior databases to compile a consolidated FBCE-CHF database for saturated inlet to expand the ranges of operating conditions and include other flow orientations in Earth gravity. Experimental CHF trends are also discussed. The interfacial lift-off model shows a good CHF predictive accuracy evidenced by a mean absolute error of 11.97% for this consolidated database after constraining it to mass velocities greater than or equal to 500 kg/m2s. Finally, this study confirmed reliability of the upcoming ISS experiments for saturated inlet conditions and the collected Earth-gravity data will be compared to ISS microgravity data."

DAVINCI will be the first mission to Venus to incorporate science driven flybys and an instrumented descent sphere into a unified architecture. The anticipated scientific outcome will be a new understanding of the atmosphere, surface, and evolutionary path of Venus as a possibly once-habitable planet and analog to hot terrestrial exoplanets. The primary mission design for DAVINCI as selected features a preferred launch in summer/fall 2029, two flybys in 2030, and descent sphere atmospheric entry by the end of 2031. The in situ atmospheric descent phase subsequently delivers definitive chemical and isotopic composition of the Venus atmosphere during an atmospheric transect above Alpha Regio. These in situ investigations of the atmosphere and near infrared descent imaging of the surface will complement remote flyby observations of the dynamic atmosphere, cloud deck, and surface near infrared emissivity. The overall mission yield will be at least 60 Gbits (compressed) new data about the atmosphere and near surface, as well as the first unique characterization of the deep atmosphere environment and chemistry, including trace gases, key stable isotopes, oxygen fugacity, constraints on local rock compositions, and topography of a tessera."

Using the CatWISE2020 W1 and W2 magnitudes along with a J-band detection from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey, the location of CWISE J052306.42−015355.4 on the W1 − W2 versus J − W2 diagram best matches that of other known, or suspected, extreme T subdwarfs. As there is currently very little knowledge concerning extreme T subdwarfs we estimate a rough distance of ≤68 pc, which results in a tangential velocity of ≤167 km/s, both of which are tentative. A measured parallax is greatly needed to test these values. We also estimate a metallicity of −1.5 < [M/H] < −0.5 using theoretical predictions."

Recent studies from Mars orbital imaging, ground penetrating radar data, and infrared thermal data have revealed that large areas of Mars at latitudes higher than 40o N host near surface ground ice. Past climate cycles driven by orbital oscillations are expected to result in the distribution of ground ice changing over geologically recent history. The insolation at any location on Mars varies over time due to quasi-periodic changes in its orbital parameters (obliquity, eccentricity, perihelion longitude). The last 2 MY Mars obliquity varied between 15o and 35o but 5 MY ago varied between 24o and 48o with the average obliquity being 36o. The current low obliquity Mars atmosphere is dryer than average conditions. Recent work (Mellon and Sizemore Icarus (2022) 371;114667) has shown that repeatedly over the last 2 MY ground ice was present even at low Northern latitudes. The ice table depth is controlled by diffusive equilibrium with water vapor in the atmosphere, which also varies with orbital parameters. Determining the surface temperature and water vapor abundance requires a sophisticated climate model that was developed at NASA Ames, and results of high obliquity climate simulations will be used in the study. Work is underway to evaluate the subsurface thermal conditions in ice-rich areas of Mars during high obliquity periods to determine whether, where, and when the subsurface ice becomes warm enough to support metabolic processes or growth of terrestrial organisms."

Real-time aerial object classification will improve onboard collision avoidance algorithm decision making and may reduce unnecessary activation of avoidance systems.  This work trains an aircraft trajectory classifier using trajectories from flight controller logs and tests the classifier using RADAR collected trajectories during air to air experiments and ground to air experiments. In contrast to RADAR data, these flight controller logs are relatively abundant, which makes the possibility of substituting flight data for RADAR data an attractive, cost-effective option.

This algorithm was developed by combining thermal inertia theory with a soil hydraulic-based approach that considers fine-scale SM spatial distribution driven by both heat fluxes and hydraulic conductivity in  soils. Relative soil wetness values were estimated using  land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index for the thermal inertia model and using soil properties for the hydraulic model. The relative soil wetness values at 1 km from both models were then combined by using weighting functions whereby the spatial distribution of SM was governed more by thermal fluxes during times of strong heat transport and infiltration  during moisture abundant soil conditions. THySM values were evaluated using in situ SM measurements from SMAP Core Validation Sites (CVS), the USDA Soil Climate Analysis Network, and the NOAA Climate Reference Network over CONUS. THySM shows higher accuracy than the SMAP / Sentinel-1 (SPL2SMAP_S) 1 km SM product when compared to in situ measurements. The accuracy of THySM is 0.048 m3/m3 based on unbiased root   mean square error (ubRMSE), outperforming SPL2SMAP_S by 0.01-0.02 m3/m3. The ubRMSE of THySM 1km SM over the SMAP grassland/rangeland-dominated CVS sites is better than 0.04 m3/m3, which meets the SMAP  mission SM accuracy requirement applied at 9 and 36 km."

In preparation for the GPM Version 7 (V07) data release, SSMIS corrections developed over a decade ago and incorporated in GPM Version 5 (V05) are reexamined and updated.  The calibration updates presented here include pointing parameters affecting geolocation and viewing geometry, along-scan bias adjustments to account for scan edge falloffs, and sun angle corrections to account for heating anomalies including an emissive reflector. To address errors in the V05 geolocation, the sensor roll, pitch, yaw, half cone angle, and timing offsets are reanalyzed and updated. The along-scan bias adjustment is updated in a manner consistent with recent Special   Sensor   Microwave Imager   updates   to   account   for variations in scene temperature. Finally, significant improvements to the SSMIS sun angle correction are made by using data from the entire mission, extending the corrections to include the higher frequency channels, and deriving a more consistent channel-to-channel correction. From V05 to V07, the geolocation adjustment is approximately 5-10 km, the earth incidence angle difference is 0-0.4°, and the average brightness temperature change is 0-2 K, but individual pixels may be up to several Kelvin difference depending on sensor and channel.

To track progress toward this goal, it is important to quantify the amount of carbon stored by various landcover types across the state. Vineyards and orchards make up a large portion of California's agricultural landcover and store considerable amounts of carbon. For this project, NASA DEVELOP partnered with the California Air Resources Board to estimate the age and carbon stock of crop-specific agricultural regions across California between 1984 and 2021. The DEVELOP team created the Perennial Agriculture Age and Carbon Estimation Tool (PAACET), a Google Earth Engine tool that employs Earth observation from the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) to estimate the age and carbon stock of vineyards and almond, walnut, pistachio, and orange orchards. The team used an ocular sampling accuracy assessment consisting of 53 sample vineyards and orchards and found that on average, PAACET estimated ages within ±4.3 years of their actual age. The tool estimated that vineyards and walnut orchards are the oldest woody croplands, and almond orchards store the largest total carbon."

As climate models project rising temperatures and continuous drought, land managers are concerned for the future of juniper in and around GCNP. This project incorporated data from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and ocular samples of the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) in a random forest model to identify patterns between characteristics of the landscape and locations of juniper woodland mortality and to model areas subject to vulnerability. This study found no significant correlation between ocularly sampled juniper tree mortality and remotely sensed environmental variables used thus, accurately modeling mortality vulnerability in the future was not feasible. The ocular sampling, however, allows the partners at the GCNP’s Science & Resource Management Division to better understand areas of juniper tree woodland mortality and the relative amount of mortality in the park. Additionally, the areas of juniper tree mortality found in this project provide the partners with guidance for future field sampling."

This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity.  Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S.marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy."

Here we report the detection of nucleobases in three carbonaceous meteorites using state-of-the-art analytical techniques optimized for small-scale quantification of nucleobases down to the range of parts per trillion (ppt). In addition to previously detected purine nucleobases in meteorites such as guanine and adenine, we identify various pyrimidine nucleobases such as cytosine, uracil, and thymine, and their structural isomers such as isocytosine, imidazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 6-methyluracil, respectively. Given the similarity in the molecular distribution of pyrimidines in meteorites and those in photon-processed interstellar ice analogues, some of these derivatives could have been generated by photochemical reactions prevailing in the interstellar medium and later incorporated into asteroids during solar system formation.

Motivation was provided by experiments conducted in the Air Force Research Laboratory Mach 6 High Reynolds Number facility on a 7-degree half-angle cone with a roughness array located at 45 degrees from the apex on two nose tips of different blutness but equivalent roughness Reynolds number. Transition was only affected on the blunter cone, indicating that the transition onset is associated with the combined effects of bluntness and roughness. The present study investigates the 15.24 mm nose radius, 420 azimuthal wavenumber case via Navier-Stokes computations of the laminar base flow and instability analysis. Plane-marching parabolized stability equations (PSE) and inflow-resolvent analysis based on the three-dimensional, harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE) are used to calculate the amplification of disturbances along the roughness wake as well as over the roughness nearfield. Results show that the roughness shape can have a great impact on the characteristics of the most amplified wake instabilities. For the experimental configuration with cubic roughness elements of 15 <i>μ</i>m height, the flow is marginally unstable. For prismatic elements of 20 <i>μ</i>m height, the PSE predicts a logarithmic disturbance amplification ratio of <i>N</i> = 5.6 along its wake, but this ratio increases to <i>N</i> = 9.6 when the amplification over the roughness and separation regions is included in the inflow-resolvent analysis."

The project was executed from Sept. 2020 through April 2022 with the objective to explore localized active flow control (AFC) concepts on a representative commercial aircraft. A detailed literature review solidified the choice of AFC concepts to be explored, including AFC over a deflected aileron, in the leading edge region of the wing, and in the nacelle/pylon/wing region. All three concepts were investigated with numerical tools. The results were used in an integration study to assess the net benefits over the lifetime of a commercial aircraft. The aerodynamic studies concluded that AFC applied over a deflected aileron yields significant net L/D improvements (incl. the penalty of AFC system requirements) of up to potentially 5% L/D. Depending on the configuration, AFC applied in the leading edge region showed improvements in L/D of up to ~1.5%, as well as opportunities for maximum lift and increased lift at fixed angle of attack. AFC applied to the nacelle/pylon/wing region delivered 1.5% increase in L/D during take-off and ~4% increase in CLmax during landing. After considering assumed onboard sources, aspects of system integration and weight penalties, these aerodynamic improvements translate to:
~ 0.5% block fuel reduction potential for AFC over the aileron
~ 0.1% block fuel reduction potential for AFC in the LE slat region
~ 0.2% block fuel reduction potential for AFC in the nacelle/pylon/wing region considering take-off scenarios (potentially larger benefit may be realized considering the landing scenarios which haven’t been fully analyzed yet)
The final report is comprised of four separate documents. The current document provides an overview and technical background. The second document details the numerical studies and the third document summarizes the integration and aircraft performance assessment. The fourth document focuses on the Common Research Model, specifically how AFC performs over a deflected aileron and how the NASA 10% scale wind tunnel model may be modified to implement an AFC equipped aileron.

The experience developed for the Reference Aircraft guided the implementation on the CRM model. CFD evaluations are performed on a representative high-lift configuration, for a set of aileron deflections, and at relevant flow conditions. Alternative flow control actuator layouts are proposed and design consideration for practical integration into the existing CRM-HL model are set forth. The CFD simulations indicate that the aerodynamic performance improvements due to AFC obtained for the CRM-HL are consistent with those achieved for the Reference Aircraft. The observed changes in L/D are smaller than for the Reference Aircraft because the CRM has a higher leading edge sweep angle and a different relative aileron size. Conceptual design studies confirmed that the integration of an AFC equipped aileron into the existing wind tunnel model is feasible."

Hence, the D/H ratio has been widely used as a tracer for the origins of extraterrestrial chemistry. However, the D/H ratio can also be influenced by cosmic rays, which are ubiquitous and can penetrate even dense interstellar molecular cores. The effects of such high-energy radiation on deuterium fractionation have not been studied in a quantitative manner. In this study, we present rate constants for radiation-induced D-to-H exchange for fully deuterated small (1–2 C) hydrocarbons embedded in H2O ice at 20 K and H-to-D exchange for the protiated forms of these molecules in D2O ice at 20 K. We observed larger rate constants for H-to-D exchange in the D2O ice versus D-to-H exchange in H2O ice, which we have attributed to the greater bond strength of C–D versus C–H. We find that the H-to-D exchange rate constants are smaller for protiated methane than ethane, in agreement with bond energies from the literature. We are unable to obtain rate constants for the unsaturated and reactive hydrocarbons ethylene and acetylene. Interpretation of the rate constants suggest that D/H exchange products are formed in abundance alongside radiolysis products.

Previous work has shown that suitable streaks of this type can significantly reduce the growth of Mack’s second mode instabilities, but large streak amplitudes can make the flow susceptible to previously absent streak instabilities that can become the leading cause of transition. Here, we use the adjoint capabilities of the SU2 flow solver to optimize the VG shape to maximize the reduction in the growth of second-mode disturbances while also preventing the streak amplitudes from reaching large enough values to precipitate an earlier onset of transition via streak instabilities. The geometry and the freestream flow conditions are selected to match a relevant trajectory lo-cation from the HIFiRE-1 flight experiment. Results show that the optimized VGs can increase the mean streak amplitude by 117% with respect to a manually developed baseline design. The stability of this optimized basic state is analyzed via the plane-marching parabolized stability equations, predicting a fully laminar flow over the entire cone, or equivalently, yielding transition delay of 130% versus the 17% for the baseline VGs."

The selection of leading edge radii and freestream parameters is informed by experimental conditions. The investigation of this 2D problem provides a slow entropy layer swallowing which allows for an isolated development of perturbations seeded upstream within different wall-normal regions of the flow. At both Mach numbers, a decrease in modal instability amplification was seen as the leading edge radius was increased. Nonmodal analysis reveals amplifying perturbations in the boundary layer as well as in the entropy layer. The medium bluntness regime exhibits the strongest amplification of nonmodal disturbances that is nonmonotonic in character. Small amplitude boundary forcing at the plate surface or volumetric forcing at various wall-normal heights was used to account for receptivity effects. While wall forcing effectively induced modal instabilities, only an actuation above the boundary layer captured disturbances that amplify within the entropy layer. The optimal nonmodal theory’s entropy-layer disturbance evolution exhibited outstanding agreement with controlled forcing, including receptivity effects. The evolution of entropy-layer disturbances from the optimal nonmodal theory showed excellent agreement with the results of receptivity to controlled forcing. Therefore, the nonmodal optimal growth analysis may provide a useful as well as efficient technique to identify the complete disturbance spectrum in blunt hypersonic configurations, where both modal and nonmodal disturbances can amplify in the boundary-layer and entropy-layer regions."

Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical climatic variable in the water cycle and is used to evaluate spatiotemporal trends in drought and flood conditions. The NASA DEVELOP team partnered with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Midwest Climate Hub, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Illinois State Water Survey, and Michigan State University to compare remotely sensed ET products with in situ observations from January 2001 through December 2020. Remotely sensed actual ET (aET) data were sourced from NASA’s Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and reference ET (refET) data were derived from the Gridded Surface Meteorological (gridMET) dataset. For in situ comparison, aET data were downloaded from the AmeriFlux database while refET data were collected from the Illinois Climate Network and Michigan State University’s Enviro-weather database. For a holistic assessment of ET, this project generated comparisons between remotely sensed and in situ observations, calculated descriptive statistics for validation between refET datasets, and spatially produced statistical validation maps regarding in situ sites. The temporal and spatial gaps of AmeriFlux data limited aET analysis. This comparative assessment of ET products across the Midwest can be used by project partners to assess regional water trends and guide future land management decisions."

These changes can compromise the ecosystem services, economic value, and cultural significance provided to the community by Jobos Bay. In collaboration with the Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (JBNERR), the Jobos Bay Water Resources II team used Earth observations to investigate water quality, watersheds land use land cover (LULC) changes, and the impact of Hurricanes Maria and Irma on mangrove forest area. This information will improve JBNERR’s understanding of the impacts of development and weather events on Jobos Bay, and will inform future shoreline management decisions that ensure continued quality of the ecosystem. Mangrove extent was examined using imagery from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), WorldView 2 WV110, and WorldView 3 WV110. Imagery from Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) was used to map watersheds LULC. Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data were analyzed with in situ data collected at the time of satellite overpass to investigate water quality in Jobos Bay. Reduction from 2017 mangrove extent was observed in 2018 following the hurricane events, and area of mapped extent was greater than 2018 in 2021.

The swamp has experienced several wildfires since the 1990s, and new development along the borders of Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge (ONWR) threatens to alter hydrologic activity and increase fire frequency. NASA DEVELOP partnered with staff at the ONWR to determine the feasibility of using satellite imagery to assess wildfire risk and map changes in vegetation cover. Using data from NASA satellites Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data from the USDA’s Crop Condition and Soil Moisture Analytics Tool (Crop-CASMA), European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-SAR), and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), the DEVELOP team assessed the relationship between hydrologic change, vegetation cover, and wildfire risk in the swamp. Results showed that the southern portion of ONWR has been burned the most since 1990 and has greater water stability than other areas of the refuge. The team also found that the largest pockets of mature forests remain in the northernmost regions. Soil moisture anomaly readings may serve as an indicator of fire conditions. The team used these results to create a vegetation map, a swamp water visibility time series map, a historical wildfire correlation analysis, and a methodology tutorial. These products will assist the ONWR in making informed management decisions about the future of the Okefenokee Swamp."

Marginalized populations, in particular, experience compounding vulnerabilities that contribute to unequal burdens of natural hazards as a result of systemic inequality stemming from historical disenfranchisement, disinvestment, and discriminatory policies such as racial redlining. This project connected with community organizations working at the intersection of environmental justice (EJ) and natural disaster management throughout the United States, to assess how NASA DEVELOP can leverage geospatial science to advance EJ efforts. Our team conducted a landscape analysis, which included a literature review, annotated bibliography, and identification of organizations working in EJ and disasters. We engaged EJ organizations in discussions to understand their current resources, challenges, and geospatial needs to inform how DEVELOP and NASA Applied Sciences can support their EJ and disaster work. Findings were compiled in a synthesis report and visualized in an ArcGIS StoryMap to showcase the work of EJ organizations, provide geospatial resources for them to explore, and provide examples of how remote sensing can be utilized in EJ and disasters work.

The Human System Risk Board (HSRB), a Health and Medical Technical Authority (HMTA) Board at NASA Johnson Space Center, is the entity responsible for identifying, assessing, analyzing, and monitoring the official understanding of the risk or risk posture for each of the Human System Risks and determining – based on evaluation of the available evidence – when that risk posture changes. The ultimate purpose of tracking and researching these risks is to find ways to reduce the risk that astronaut crews face during spaceflight. Historically, research, development and operations relevant to one risk have been conducted in isolation from other risks; these individual risk ‘silos’ enabled initial characterization of each specific risk. In spaceflight however, the impact of exposure to risk for astronaut crews is cumulative, and not independent of exposures or other risks, as all the adverse effects of the spaceflight environment begin at launch, continue throughout the duration of the mission and in some cases across the lifetime of the crews. In January of 2020, the HSRB at NASA embarked on a pilot project designed to assess the potential value of causal diagramming as a tool to facilitate understanding these cumulative and interdependent effects as applied within Human System Risk management. This process uses directed acyclic graphs as a means of formalizing a shared mental model of the causal flow of risk among Risk Board stakeholders. Initially this model was to improve communication among those stakeholders, but the potential value exceeds communication alone. Formalization of the process for creating these causal diagrams will enable the creation of a composite risk network that is vetted by members of the NASA community and configuration managed. The causal diagrams are formulated as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to function as a type of knowledge graph for reference for the board and its stakeholders. This document outlines the pilot process, the standardized approaches, and guidance for risk custodian teams when creating and updating DAGs as a part of the NASA Human System Risk Management process."

For spacecraft that are designed to be periodically re-supplied, a key logistics consumable is propellant, as it constitutes the greatest up-mass on re-supply vehicles. A trajectory design strategy is therefore desired that minimizes propellant usage in order to ease the demand for propellant re-supply missions. This thesis develops such a strategy in three
stages, and uses the International Space Station (ISS) as its testbed, as no other LEO spacecraft is more challenging from a space logistics standpoint.

First, the ISS trajectory planning problem is formulated as a constrained burn optimization problem assuming a deterministic atmosphere. The cost function is total ∆v, with constraints imposed on longitude of ascending
viii node (LAN) and semi-major axis (SMA) altitude. Analytic derivatives are constructed for both the cost and constraints, which are necessary given the 6-week to 2-year time frames being considered. A gradient-based optimizer
is then utilized to find locally-optimal solutions to real-world ISS trajectory planning problems.

Second, atmospheric uncertainty is addressed by constructing a probabilistic model of space weather data using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Bayesian inference is performed using the GP model to generate mean and covariance estimates for space weather predictions, whose pedigree is assessed against test data. The predictions are then mapped into atmospheric density via the analytic Jacchia-Roberts density model, and the effect of space weather uncertainty on orbital lifetime is examined.

Third, an ISS burn execution uncertainty model is developed. This model, along with the space weather uncertainty model, are deployed in a linear covariance analysis to ascertain their combined effect on LAN and SMA altitude dispersions. The deterministic constraints from the original problem are re-formulated as stochastic constraints, where now the constraint uncertainty interval is required to fall within specified bounds. An updated optimization framework is constructed using the original ∆v cost function along with the stochastic constraints to solve the trajectory optimization problem under atmospheric uncertainty. Finally, the complete architecture is summarized for deployment in an operational setting."

These newfound populations present an excellent laboratory for studying the assembly process of the Milky Way thin disc. In this work, we use data from GALAH DR3 to investigate the chemical distributions and ages of 18 newfound stellar populations, 10 of which are strings and 8 of which are compact in morphology. We estimate the intrinsic abundance dispersions in [X/H] of each population and compare them with those of both their local fields and the open cluster (OC) M 67. We find that all but one of these groups are more chemically homogeneous than their local fields. Furthermore, half of the strings, namely Theias 139, 169, 216, 303, and 309, have intrinsic [X/H] dispersions that range between 0.01 and 0.07 dex in most elements, equivalent to those of many OCs. These results provide important new observational constraints on star formation and the chemical homogeneity of the local interstellar medium (ISM). We investigate each population’s Li and chemical clock abundances(e.g. [Sc/Ba], [Ca/Ba], [Ti/Ba], and [Mg/Y]) and find that the ages suggested by chemistry generally support the isochronal ages in all but six structures. This work highlights the unique advantages that chemistry holds in the study of kinematically related stellar groups."

Despite rapid growth in computational power, the perceived need for higher model resolutions overwhelms the latest generation computers, reducing the ability of modelers to generate simulations for understanding parameter sensitivities and characterizing variability and uncertainty. Thus, surrogate models are often developed to capture the essential attributes of the full-blown numerical models. Recent successes of machine learning methods, especially deep learning (DL), across many disciplines offer the possibility that complex nonlinear connectionist representations may be able to capture the underlying complex structures and nonlinear processes in Earth systems. A difficult test for DL-based emulation, which refers to function approximation of numerical models, is to understand whether they can be comparable to traditional forms of surrogate models in terms of computational efficiency while simultaneously reproducing model results in a credible manner. A DL emulation that passes this test may be expected to perform even better than simple models with respect to capturing complex processes and spatiotemporal dependencies. Here, we examine, with a case study in satellite-based remote sensing, the hypothesis that DL approaches can credibly represent the simulations from a surrogate model with comparable computational efficiency. Our results are encouraging in that the DL emulation reproduces the results with acceptable accuracy and often even faster performance. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of the pace of improvements in high-performance implementations of DL and the growing desire for higher resolution simulations in the Earth sciences."

This fast and energetic ((E =3 ×10(exp 35)) ̇ erg s(exp -1) millisecond pulsar was first detected as a gamma-ray point source in Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) sky survey observations. Guided by a steep-spectrum radio point source in the Fermi error region, we performed a search at 820 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope that first discovered the pulsations. The initial radio pulse timing observations provided enough information to seed a search for gamma-ray pulsations in the LAT data, from which we derive a timing solution valid for the full Fermi mission. In addition to the discovery and timing of radio and gamma-ray pulsations, we searched for X-ray pulsations using NICER but no significant pulsations were detected. We also obtained time-series r-band photometry that indicates strong heating of the companion star by the pulsar wind.

Previous work has shown that nonlinearities in tidewater glacier and ice stream dynamics can lead to biases in simulated ice mass change in the presence of noisy forcings. Ice sheet modeling projections that are used in the IPCC Assessment Report 6 (AR6) utilize atmospheric and oceanic forcings at annual temporal resolution, omitting any higher frequency forcings. Here, we quantify the effect of seasonal (<1 year) tidewater glacier terminus oscillations on decadal-scale (30 years) mass change. We use an idealized geometry to mimic realistic tidewater glacier geometries and investigate the impact of the magnitude of seasonal oscillations, bed slope at the glacier terminus, and basal friction law. We find that omitting seasonal terminus motion results in biased mass change projections, with up to an 39% underestimate or 25% overestimate of mass loss when seasonality is neglected, depending on bed slope and magnitude of oscillations. The bias is most sensitive to the magnitude of the seasonal terminus oscillations and exhibits very little sensitivity to choice of friction law. Although omitting seasonal terminus motion may bias mass change projections of individual glaciers, further work is needed to investigate the impact on ice sheet mass change projections. In order to achieve this, seasonality in atmospheric and oceanic forcings must be adequately represented and observations of seasonal terminus positions and tidewater glacier thickness changes must be acquired to evaluate numerical models.

This experiment provides, for the first time, clear evidence that the growth of fayalite can occur during hydrotherma lalteration, as described previously in meteorites. These newly formed fayalite crystals are elongated and porous, similar to the ones described in CV3, CK, and ordinary chondrites. The results show that (1) fayalite could form even if chemical equilibrium was not reached in the experiment, at a water to rock mass ratio (0.4 W/R at the beginning of the experiment) higher than the values calculated to be thermodynamically viable at equilibrium(W/R > 0.2); (2) the composition and the texture of the reactants changed during the hydrothermal alteration process, suggesting that the reactants, especially the amorphous silicates, underwent dissolution and reprecipitation; (3) fayalite can form at low temperature(220°C), which is at the transition between hydrothermal alteration and fluid-assisted metamorphism in chondrites. The results are consistent with previous mineralogical observations and thermodynamic models, which suggest that fayalite crystals are formed on asteroidal parent bodies by the interaction between a hydrothermal fluid and disequilibrium assemblages that compose the pristine materials that condensed in the early solar nebula. This experiment suggests that two variables play a very important role in the formation off ayalite during the hydrothermal growth (W/R mass ratio and the fluid composition). These results are similar to the recent observations of the fine-grained matrix of ordinary chondrites."

This coupled modeling framework builds on the linkage between land surface models (LSMs), which simulate surface boundary conditions in atmospheric models, and distributed hydrologic models, which simulate horizontal surface and sub-surface flow, adding new land DA capabilities. In the present study, we employ this modeling framework in the Tuolumne River basin in central California. We demonstrate the added value of the assimilation of NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates in the Tuolumne basin. This analysis is performed in both LIS as an LSM column model and LIS/WRF-Hydro, with hydrologic routing. Results demonstrate that ASO DA in the basin reduced snow bias by as much as 30% from an open-loop (OL) simulation compared to three independent datasets. It also reduces downstream streamflow runoff biases by as much as 40%, and improves streamflow skill scores in both wet and dry years. Analysis of soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) also reveals the impacts of hydrologic routing from WRF-Hydro in the simulations, which would otherwise not be resolved in an LSM column model. By demonstrating the beneficial impact of SWE DA on the improving streamflow forecasts, the article outlines the importance of such observational inputs for reservoir operations and related water management applications."

This comparison was conducted during the extremely quiescent Solar Cycle 24 minimum, so all observed differences and drifts between the two sensors are instrumental in nature. The TSIS-1 SIM benefitted from advanced calibration capabilities based on SI standards that were not available during the preflight calibration time period of SORCE. For this reason, a revision of the SORCE SIM absolute scale is appropriate. As expected, wavelength dependent differences in absolute agreement are a function of detector sensitivity and local changes in spectral slope. At the time of the comparison SORCE SIM has been on-orbit for 17 years while TSIS-1 observations commenced immediately after a 100-day outgassing and commissioning period. Peak-to-peak absolute scale differences are about 12% with a mean fractional difference of 0.7% ± 2.9%. The greatest scale differences occur at the change-over between the UV and visible photodiodes in the 310 nm region, and a systematic disagreement is present in the 850–1,600 nm range. A multiplicative scale correction factor has been developed to reconcile the TSIS-1 and SORCE difference with a wavelength dependent error on the mean typically less than 0.01% derived from every matched pair of observations."

However, these sanitizing methods do not address the fact that the electrical charge, filtration efficacy, and breathability of such masks may be expected to degrade during long-term use based on mechanisms known in the literature.  In this study, approaches to electrically (re)charging facemask filter materials were explored in response to the COVID-19 induced shortage of N95 masks.  The effort consisted of charging experiments followed by filtration testing conducted at the coupon level during a month-long period (May 2020).  The main focus of the work was to develop a recharging technique which could eventually be adapted and used as part of a broader full-performance restoration process for used N95 masks, e.g., which might employ simple washing by alcohol or soapy water as a preceding step for sanitization and declogging.  Most tested coupons were therefore nonwoven meltblown fibrous polypropylene (PP) filter media extracted from decades old N95 masks.  Keeping in mind commonly used cloth facemasks, limited trials were also performed with some commercially available fabrics.  Charging was done at elevated temperature and was followed by cooling to freeze in the applied charges produced from corona discharges using different electrode configurations and parameter combinations, or from triboelectric rubbing.  Charging was also focused on using potentially scalable equipment, e.g., Van de Graaff generators or consumer ionic hair products.  Some degree of success was achieved with one of the fabrics and the PP filter media which was first purposefully discharged to have typical filtration efficiency (FE) of ~35%.  Numerous attempts at corona charging discharged media resulted in filtration efficiency (FE) ≥ 80 – 85%.  Some measure of charge robustness was also established via stable performance during loading testing.  However, results where FE ≥ 90% were not reliably repeatable and no results met the FE ≥ 95% goal due to shortcomings of the charging process.

In this study, I report calcium isotopic compositions for well-characterized lavas from the Central American volcanic arc that exhibit a range of trace element and radiogenic isotope signatures that have been used to indicate variable amounts of subducted marine carbonate and hemipelagic sedimentary rocks, fresh carbonatite lavas from Oldoinyo Lengai Volcano, Tanzania, and an intrusive carbonatite clast erupted 12.8 ka from the Laacher See Volcano, Germany. I observed no calcium isotope evidence for recycled sedimentary rocks in the Central American arc magmas or in the Oldoinyo Lengai carbonatite volcanic rocks. They all exhibit isotopic compositions similar to rocks dominated by a primitive, mantle-like, bulk silicate Earth (BSE) composition. The exception in this work is the calcium isotope composition measured in the intrusive Laacher See carbonatite that is resolvable from BSE (δ^44 Ca = 0.0). Although this calcium isotopic signature might be related to ancient carbonate recycling, the magnitude and relatively light calcium isotopic composition (δ^44 Ca = –0.4) of this carbonatite could also reflect an origin that involved partial melting of altered lithospheric mantle, from which isotopically heavy Ca-bearing fluids have been lost. The decoupled signatures between trace elements and their radiogenic isotopes and those recorded by calcium isotope data are important because they likely reflect different sources and processes, and demonstrate that sediment subduction is not a bulk mixing process."

This increase in air traffic includes the increase of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (AVs) of all sizes, at all altitudes, and varying average speeds. The technology of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Rebroadcasting (ADS-R) combines the existing technology used with manned AVs in the NAS called, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), and an ‘physical layer’ digital communications technology called flooding. Flooding allows the retransmission of the existing ADS-B AV flight information to ‘in the area’ adjacent AVs, where in a few retransmission epochs will have communicated to all AVs in the designated geographic area."

The communication middleware, implemented in the TestBed framework layer, is a core feature for data message exchange. The feature provides an abstraction layer called Messaging Support to allow switching one middleware to another without a need to rebuild the simulation components. Messaging performance such as latencies, run durations, and throughputs are important factors. Low latencies can produce accurate results in high-fidelity and visualization models. Short run durations are preferred because better run efficiency can be achieved. High throughputs allow more runs to be executed concurrently. This technical memorandum studies and compares the messaging performance by running a full-day, fast-time simulation using three communication middleware as well as tweaking the default communication middleware settings used by the TestBed. Results indicate that the messaging performance could be improved by disabling either compression or persistence settings, while the run duration and throughput could be further improved by disabling both settings with a tradeoff of the message latencies increased by a factor of ten."

We used data acquired by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft to create the first global geologic map of the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu. As this is the first geologic map of a small, non-spherical, rubble-pile asteroid, we discuss the distinctive mapping challenges and best practices that may be useful for future exploration of similar asteroids, such as those to be visited with the Hera and Janus missions. By mapping on two centimeter-scale global image mosaics (2D projected space) and a centimeter-scale global shape model (3D space), we generated three input maps respectively describing Bennu’s shape features, geologic features, and surface texture. Based on these input maps, we defined two geologic units: the Smooth Unit and the Rugged Unit. The units are differentiated primarily on the basis of surface texture, concentrations of boulders, and the distributions of lineaments, mass movement features, and craters. They are bounded by several scarps. The Rugged Unit contains abundant boulders and signs of recent mass movement. It also has fewer small(<20 m), putatively fresh craters than the Smooth Unit, suggesting that such craters have been erased in the former. Based on these geologic indicators, we infer that the Rugged Unit has the younger surface of the two. Differential crater size-frequency distributions and the distribution of the freshest craters suggest that both unit surfaces formed ~10–65 million years ago, when Bennu was located in the Main Asteroid Belt, and the Smooth Unit has not been significantly resurfaced in the past 2 million years. Meanwhile, the Rugged Unit has experienced resurfacing within the past ~500,000years during Bennu’s lifetime as a near-Earth asteroid. The geologic units are consistent with global diversity in slope, surface roughness, normal albedo, and thermal emission spectral characteristics. The site on Bennu where the OSIRIS-REx mission collected a regolith sample is located in the Smooth Unit, in a small crater nested within a larger one. So although the Smooth Unit is an older surface than the Rugged Unit, the impact-crater settingindicates that the material sampled was recently exposed. Several similarities are apparent between Bennu and asteroid (162173) Ryugu from a global geologic perspective, including two geologic units distinguishable by variations in the number density of boulders, as well as in other datasets such as brightness."

Its dominant fluxes, gross primary productivity (GPP), and respiration (in particular soil respiration, RS), are typically estimated from independent satellite-driven models and upscaled in situ measurements, respectively. We combine carbon-cycle flux estimates and partitioning coefficients to show that historical estimates of global GPP and RS are irreconcilable. When we estimate GPP based on RS measurements and some assumptions about RS:GPP ratios, we found the resulted global GPP values (bootstrap mean 149^(+29)_(−23) Pg C/yr) are significantly higher than most GPP estimates reported in the literature (113^(+18)_(−18) Pg C/yr). Similarly, historical GPP estimates imply a soil respiration flux (Rs(_GPP), bootstrap mean of 68^(+10)_(−8) Pg C/yr) statistically inconsistent with most published RS values (87^(+9)_(−8) Pg C/yr), although recent, higher, GPP estimates are narrowing this gap. Furthermore, global R_(S):GPP ratios are inconsistent with spatial averages of this ratio calculated from individual sites as well as CMIP6 model results. This discrepancy has implications for our understanding of carbon turnover times and the terrestrial sensitivity to climate change. Future efforts should reconcile the discrepancies associated with calculations for GPP and Rs to improve estimates of the global carbon budget."

Due to the expected design choices, there are risks that the airport community noise, associated with landing and takeoff of civilian-transport aircraft, could be increased or, at minimum, that further overall propulsion-noise reduction could become limited. It is argued here that the main culprit in these scenarios is noise originating from sources in the combustor. The classical combustor-noise prediction model is summarized and its possible extension to the planned parameter space is discussed. An acoustic-power scaling law is derived and utilized to give initial estimates for what can be expected by core-design choices. An ideal-cycle parametric turbofan model provides input for these estimates."

However, we lack a unified, process-based understanding that can explain the observed dynamic changes of all outlet glaciers. Many glaciers undergo seasonal dynamic thickness changes, and classifying the patterns of seasonal thickness change can improve our understanding of the processes that drive glacier behavior. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides space-based, seasonally repeating altimetry measurements of the ice sheets, allowing us to quantify near-termini seasonal dynamic thickness patterns of 37 outlet glaciers around the Greenland Ice Sheet. We classify the glaciers into seven common patterns of seasonal thickness change over a 2-year period from 2019 to 2020. We find small groupings of neighboring glaciers with similar patterns of seasonal thickness change, but, within larger sectors of the ice sheet, patterns of seasonal thickness change are mostly heterogeneous. Future studies can build upon our results by extending these time series, comparing seasonal dynamic thickness changes with external forcings, such as ocean temperature and meltwater runoff, and with other dynamic variables such as seasonal glacier velocity and terminus position changes."

To calculate the N-factor, the flow variables are decomposed into a laminar basic state solution and the linear disturbances, which are assumed to be harmonic in time. The most commonly used linear stability analysis approaches include the locally parallel linear stability theory (LST) and the non-local, weakly nonparallel parabolized stability equations (PSE). However, these methods do not account for strong streamwise gradients that are encountered in several configurations of interest, as roughness elements, steps, gaps, or corners. To solve the linear evolution of disturbances along such strongly nonparallel regions, the harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE) need to be solved. The discretization of the HLNSE for spanwise/azimuthally inhomogeneous laminar basic states yields a linear system of complex arithmetic with a leading dimension of the order of 107 to 108. A combined multithread and multiprocessor algorithm is implemented for the direct solution of such linear system. Results for a supersonic boundary layer over a three-dimensional roughness patch show good agreement with experimental measurements when the evolution of the instability waves over the roughness patch is included via the HLNSE."

Alchemite had higher accuracy when making predictions on sparse data and was more accurate or nearly as accurate as random forests on complete datasets while also quantifying uncertainty. The software was also used to suggest processing steps and design parameters to optimize properties and performance; however, physical validation of the suggested design parameters was beyond the scope of this work.  Several useful design insights were gained about the impact of the design parameters on properties and performance including the importance of dopant choice and amount for shape memory alloys and the importance of height and weight on the thermal resistance of heat exchangers."

The governing equations that are employed include allowances for both chemical and thermal nonequilibrium processes, coupled with a wide variety of turbulence models for both Reynolds-averaged and large eddy simulations. The software package can simulate two-dimensional, axisymmetric, or three-dimensional problems on structured multiblock meshes or fully unstructured meshes. A parabolic (i.e.,  space-marching) treatment can also be used for any subset of a structured mesh that can accommodate this solution strategy. The flow solver provides a significant level of geometric flexibility for structured grid simulations by allowing for arbitrary face-to-face C(0) continuous and non-C(0) continuous block interface connectivities. The unstructured grid paradigm allows for mixed element unstructured meshes that contain any combination of tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal, and hexahedral cell elements. The flow solver is also fully parallelized using MPI (Message Passing Interface) libraries in a data-parallel fashion, allowing for efficient simulations on modern High Performance Computing (HPC) systems.

Here we present an innovative mission concept that builds upon the heritage of past and current missions improving the sensitivity and, very importantly, the angular resolution. This consists in combining a Compton telescope and a coded-mask telescope. We delineate the motivation for such a concept and we define the scientific goals for such a mission. The Galactic Explorer with a Coded Aperture Mask Compton Telescope (GECCO) is a novel concept for a next-generation telescope covering hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray energies. The potential and importance of this approach that bridges the observational gap in the MeV energy range are presented. With the unprecedented angular resolution of the coded mask telescope combined with the sensitive Compton telescope, a mission such as GECCO can disentangle the discrete sources from the truly diffuse emission. Individual Galactic and extragalactic sources are detected. This also allows to understand the gamma-ray Galactic center excess and the Fermi Bubbles, and to trace the low-energy cosmic rays, and their propagation in the Galaxy. Nuclear and annihilation lines are spatially and spectrally resolved from the continuum emission and from sources, addressing the role of low-energy cosmic rays in star formation and galaxy evolution, the origin of the 511 keV positron line, fundamental physics, and the chemical enrichment in the Galaxy. Such an instrument also detects explosive transient gamma-ray sources, which, in turn, enables identifying and studying the astrophysical objects that produce gravitational waves and neutrinos in a multi-messenger context. By looking at a poorly explored energy band it also allows discoveries of new astrophysical phenomena."

Using the temperature profiles measured by the SABER instrument (2002–2021), we derive the global GW action and its scale height (HAm). Comparing to the background scale height (H), we identify a persistent layer of enhanced GW dissipation (HAm/H > 2) in the upper mesosphere. The enhanced dissipation is primarily centered at 80–85 km with a vertical range of ∼8–20 km. At middle and high latitudes, the enhanced dissipation extends down to ∼60 km and is located above the eastward (westward) wind peak in winter (summer). At low latitudes, enhanced dissipation occurs around the wind reversals. The possible mechanisms of enhanced dissipation include wave refraction, wind filtering, and reduced static stability. The persistent layer of enhanced dissipation identified here provide observational evidence for GW dissipation constrains in models."

To fully realize the potential of these systems, eventually scaling to hundreds or thousands of spacecraft,  distributed space systems need to be operated as a single entity,  which will enable a variety of novel scientific space missions.  The Distributed Spacecraft Autonomy (DSA) project is a software project which aims to mature the technology needed for those systems, namely autonomous decision-making and swarm networking.  The DSA project leverages a containerized swarm test framework to simulate spacecraft software,  which can identify emergent behavior early in development.  Container virtualization allows distributed spacecraft systems to be simulated entirely in software on a single computer, avoiding the overhead associated with conventional approaches like hardware facsimiles and virtual machines. For this approach to be effective, the simulated system behavior must not be artificially influenced by the swarm test framework itself.  To address this, we present a series of benchmarks to quantify virtual network bandwidth available on a single-host computer and contextualize this against the network and application behavior of the DSA swarm test framework."

Looking towards the future, P-band (0.3-1 GHz) is a promising technique to replace or enhance the L-band (1.4  GHz) SMOS and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) missions because of an expected reduction in roughness and vegetation impact, leading to an improved soil moisture accuracy over rougher soil surfaces and more densely vegetated areas. Accordingly, this investigation evaluated the tau-omega model at P-band (0.75 GHz) using a tower-based experiment in Victoria, Australia, where  brightness temperature observations were collected concurrently at P- and L-band over bare and wheat-covered flat and periodic soil surfaces. The potential to retrieve soil moisture without discriminating periodic and flat surfaces was investigated by applying the roughness and vegetation parameters calibrated for flat soil to retrieve the moisture of periodic soil. Results showed that P-band had a comparable RMSE across different roughness configurations (variations less than 0.016 m3/m3) for both bare and wheat-covered soil, while the L-band RMSE was only comparable for wheat-covered soil, indicating that periodic surfaces did not need to be discriminated in such scenarios. Conversely, a difference of 0.022 m3/m3 was observed for L-band with bare soil. A reduced vegetation impact was also demonstrated at  P-band, with an RMSE of 0.029 m3/m3 achieved when completely ignoring the wheat existence with under 4-kg/m2 vegetation water content, whereas at  L-band the RMSE increased to 0.063 m3/m3. This study therefore paves the way for a successful P-band radiometer mission for obtaining more accurate global soil moisture information."

The key variables of interest include surface net shortwave radiation, surface net longwave radiation, skin temperature, near-surface soil temperature, snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE), and total runoff. First, the point-scale assessment is mainly conducted via evaluating against ground-based measurements. In general, the assimilation enabled estimates are better than no-assimilation counterparts. Second, the basin-scale runoff assessment demonstrates that across three snow-dominated basins, the assimilation enabled experiment yields systematic improvements in all goodness-of-fit statistics through mitigating the negative effects brought by the fixed long-term precipitation correction factors. For example, when forced by the bias-corrected precipitation, the assimilation-enabled experiment improves the bias by 69%, the root-mean-squared error by 30%, and the unbiased root-mean-squared error by 18% (relative to the no-assimilation counterpart). Finally, the domainscale assessment is conducted via evaluating against satellite-based SWE and skin temperature products.

Four GCMs have participated in THAI so far: ExoCAM, LMD-Generic, ROCKE-3D and the UM. This paper, focused on the simulated observations, is the third part of a trilogy, following the analysis of two land planet scenarios (part I) and two aquaplanet scenarios (part II). Here, we show a robust agreement between the simulated spectra and the number of transits estimated to detect the land planet atmospheres. For the cloudy aquaplanet ones, a 5-σ detection of CO2 could be achieved in about 10 transits if the atmosphere contains at least 1 bar of CO2. That number can vary by 41- 56% depending on the GCM used to predict the terminator profiles, principally due to differences in the cloud deck altitude, with ExoCAM and LMD-G producing higher clouds than ROCKE-3D and UM. Therefore, for the first time, this work provides ""GCM uncertainty error bars"" of ~ 50% that need to be considered in future analyses of transmission spectra. We also analyzed the inter-transit variability induced by weather patterns and changes of terminator cloudiness between transits. Its magnitude differs significantly between the GCMs but its impact on the transmission spectra is within the measurement uncertainties.

This is distinct from model updating, which attempts to modify models to improve their accuracy. UQ does not improve the accuracy of models, but accepts that the models are inherently inaccurate and attempts to quantify the impact of that inaccuracy on predicted results. Previously, an alternate method for UQ, called the Hybrid Parametric Variation (HPV) method, was applied to Space Launch System (SLS) Hurty/Craig-Bampton (HCB) components to predict system-level statistics for launch vehicle attitude control transfer functions and core stage section loads due to buffet. The HPV method combines a parametric variation of the HCB fixed-interface (FI) modal frequencies with a nonparametric variation (NPV) method that randomly varies the HCB mass and stiffness matrices as Wishart  random matrix distributions using random matrix theory (RMT).  

Alternatively, the most common method for modeling uncertainty in the structural dynamics community is a parametric approach, which varies physical parameters in the model. However, there are several disadvantages associated with the parametric method. Determining a reduced set of parameters that have a significant impact on the system response can be time consuming, and the selected parameter probability distributions are rarely reliably known. Therefore, in practice, the parameters are surrogates for the actual errors, and the link to parameter uncertainty is unknown. Another major drawback is that the uncertainty that can be represented is limited to the form of the nominal FEM. It is the experience of the authors that based on numerous aerospace programs, almost all FEM errors are in form rather than parameter values. This hypothesis is supported by the observation of the authors that it is almost never possible to ‘tune’ a FEM to match modal test results by only modifying model parameters. Model-form uncertainty cannot be directly represented by FEM input parameters nor included in a parametric approach. However, model-form uncertainty can be modeled using RMT, where a probability distribution is developed for the matrix ensemble of interest. The major advantage of the NPV method is that it covers errors in model form.  

The HPV method anchors uncertainty at the HCB component level to component modal test results by matching the HCB and test modes based on mode descriptions or other methods, and then applying differing levels of frequency variation. The specific variations depend on the confidence to which a component FEM has been validated through modal testing. The NPV method is layered on the frequency variation to match modal test self-orthogonality and cross-orthogonality (XO) results. Once the component uncertainty models are identified, they are assembled, and the uncertainty is propagated to the system level using a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis approach that generates statistics for system-level predictions This provides a UQ method that can be traced to test data, which can be updated as additional data and improved correlated models become available. The purpose of this paper is to collect and present all of the theory for HPV that has been previously published in reports and papers and to present examples of its application. Specifically, component uncertainty models based on the dispersion of corresponding mass and stiffness matrices using proposed test/analysis correlation metrics are investigated. The first example is purely academic so that the true answers are known, and the validity of the HPV method and the corresponding uncertainty models can be determined.

Based on this work and other assessments, the HPV method provides another tool to the toolset used for complex system UQ analysis. From experience gathered to date using the HPV method, additional design specific applications must be investigated to provide further confidence in the validity of the HPV method of UQ analysis."

Although a climate community has focused on a negative trend of AO in recent decades, the significant positive trend of AO over the last 60 years has not yet been thoroughly discussed. By analyzing reanalysis and Atmospheric Model Inter-comparison Project (AMIP) datasets with novel pacemaker experiments, we found that sea surface temperature warming in the Indian Ocean is conducive to the positive trend of AO from the late 1950s. The momentum flux convergence by stationary waves due to the Indian Ocean warming plays an important role in the positive trend of AO, which is characterized by a poleward shift of zonal-mean zonal winds. In addition, the reduced upward propagating wave activity flux over the North Pacific due to Indian Ocean warming also plays a role to strengthen the polar vortex, subsequently, it contributes to the positive trend of AO. Our results imply that the respective warming trend of tropical ocean basins including Indian Ocean, which is either anthropogenic forcing or natural variability or their combined effect, should be considered to correctly project the future AO’s trend."

LunaNet will include Earth ground stations and orbiting spacecraft and will provide services to human exploration, lunar science, and space technology missions. LunaNet will start with a simple architecture of a few nodes to meet the needs of the early missions and evolve to meet the growing needs of a sustained lunar presence. All relay network services are not expected to be met by a single spacecraft, or node. The expectation is that the needs of users will be met through a combination of interoperable systems provided by NASA, international partners, and commercial providers. Interoperability across this network-of-networks can be achieved through negotiation of mutually-agreed-upon standards that will be reflected in this document and in the specifications defined by other participants in the cooperative lunar network. This document was written and reviewed by NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA)."

Currently, there is no standard metrics to assess this effect and factors affecting ACC are not well understood. This paper discusses benefits and drawbacks of different methods used to reveal ACC and suggest a power surge testing (PST) as a procedure for screening and qualification of PTCs. The suggested test is similar to the surge current testing that is currently used for MnO2 tantalum capacitors but assures dissipation of high power in the part during the whole period of testing. Using various types of capacitors, the reproducibility of test results for different lots of PTCs and from sample to sample in a lot were estimated. The impact of moisture content, test temperature, stress voltages, and preconditioning is assessed.  Thermal effects associated with ACC and the possibility of catastrophic failures were studied experimentally using an IR camera and calculated at adiabatic heating conditions. Possible mechanisms of the phenomenon are discussed and recommendations for testing to avoid failures related to ACC are suggested."

The unique nature of the JWST mission led to various adaptations of the Ariane 5 launch system to fulfill stringent cleanliness and hygrometry requirements all along the launch preparation. JWST integration and test activities in the Final Assembly Building (BAF) had to be performed in ISO Class 7 equivalent conditions under Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) protection and monitoring. For this purpose, a dedicated air supply system equipped with Airborne Molecular Contamination (AMC) filters was installed in the umbilical mast. The fairing itself was specially sealed to protect the inner environment, and to, guarantee ISO Class 7, the BAF Composite Hall (BAF-HC) facilities were upgraded with a removable “Air Shower Curtain” (AShC) containment enclosure between the mobile platforms around JWST. The preparation of these Ariane 5 launch system adaptations started several years before the launch campaign with close cooperation and coordination between Arianespace, ArianeGroup, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This paper describes their specificities and addresses the challenges experienced to achieve the successful mission preparation."

However, such predictions often suffer from the systematic errors, which depend on crystal geometry. Each computed property of a particular crystal structure typically has a relatively small random error and a larger systematic error. Cancellation of systematic errors allows more accurate predictions. We propose a computational methodology based on the subtraction of the systematic errors in MST. To exemplify it, we apply it to the precipitated alloys. Considering precipitation strengthening in Ni superalloys, we compute the relative enthalpies of the competing Ni_3(Al_{1-x}Ti_x)_1 crystal structures with a chemical disorder on the Al+Ti sublattice. Such predicted composition-structure-property dependencies are useful for the guided design of the next-generation alloys with improved strength. Our predictions are validated by comparison with the results of other DFT methods (having a higher computational cost) and with experiment."

The first synthesis of this state relied on inferences from widespread airborne and satellite observations and numerical models, for which most of the underlying datasets have since been updated. Further, new and independent constraints on the basal thermal state have been developed from analysis of basal and englacial reflections observed by airborne radar sounding. Here we synthesize constraints on the Greenland Ice Sheet's basal thermal state from boreholes, thermomechanical ice-flow models that participated in the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6), IceBridge BedMachine Greenland v4 bed topography, Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Multi-Year Greenland Ice Sheet Velocity Mosaic v1 and multiple inferences of a thawed bed from airborne radar sounding. Most constraints can only identify where the bed is likely thawed rather than where it is frozen. This revised synthesis of the Greenland likely Basal Thermal State version 2 (GBaTSv2) indicates that 33 % of the ice sheet's bed is likely thawed, 40 % is likely frozen and the remainder (28 %) is too uncertain to specify. The spatial pattern of GBaTSv2 is broadly similar to the previous synthesis, including a scalloped frozen core and thawed outlet-glacier systems. Although the likely basal thermal state of nearly half (46 %) of the ice sheet changed designation, the assigned state changed from likely frozen to likely thawed (or vice versa) for less than 6 % of the ice sheet. This revised synthesis suggests that more of northern Greenland is likely thawed at its bed and conversely that more of southern Greenland is likely frozen, both of which influence interpretation of the ice sheet's present subglacial hydrology and models of its future evolution. The GBaTSv2 dataset, including both code that performed the analysis and the resulting datasets, is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6759384 (MacGregor, 2022)."

for multiple Design Reference Missions (DRM) and analysis of radiation effects on avionics with
the goal of producing radiation tolerant Neuromorphic Computing processor chips with innovative radiation-induced fault mitigation. The NASA process for defining radiation requirements for flight avionics is applied to this domain. The effects of trapped protons and electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts predominates in Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) and the solar wind, solar flares and Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) are the dominant radiation challenge in the open space between the planets of our solar system. The nature and energy of the particles that cause circuit upset and failure is very different in the two regimes. Two results are produced from the radiation models:  determining the Total Integrated Dose (TID) experienced by avionics for a given DRM and predicting the Single Event Effects (SEE) rates for avionics during high rate exposure. These tools are applied to existing semiconductors and can be used for predicting the radiation performance of future semiconductors based on early radiation testing of new devices."

A drawback of DFR-related methods for rain estimation, however, is the non-unique relationship between Dm and DFR. At Ku- and Ka-band frequencies, two solutions for Dm exist when DFR is less than zero. This ambiguity generates multiple solutions for the range profiles of the particle size parameters. We investigate characteristics of these solutions for both the initial-value (forward) and final-value (backward) forms of the equations. To choose one of among many possible range profiles of Dm, number concentration and rain rate, R, independently measured path attenuations are used. For the backward approach the possibility exists of dispensing with externally measured path attenuations by achieving consistency between the input and output path attenuations. The methods are tested by means of a simulation based on disdrometer-measured raindrop size distributions and the results are compared with a simplified version of the operational R-Dm method."

The different parameterizations were derived from a variety of sources, including classical nucleation theory, field and laboratory measurements. Despite the large spread in the ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the parameterizations, the cloud properties and radiative fluxes had a tendency to form two groups, with the lower INP concentration category producing larger water path and low-level cloud fraction during winter and early spring, whereas the opposite occurred during the summer season. The stability of the lower troposphere was found to strongly correlate with low-cloud fraction, and along with the effect of ice nucleation, ice sedimentation and melting rates, appears to explain the spring-to-summer reversal pattern in the relative magnitude of the cloud properties between the two categories of simulations. The strong modulation effect of the liquid phase on immersion freezing led to the successful simulation of the characteristic Arctic cloud structure, with a layer rich in supercooled water near cloud top and ice and snow at lower levels. Comparison with satellite retrievals and in situ data suggest that simulations with low INP concentrations more realistically represent Arctic clouds and radiation."

These effects would be most severe for the first five years after the nuclear war and may last for more than a decade. This paper calculates how food availability would change by employing the Environmental Impact and Sustainability Applied General Equilibrium model. Under a robust world trading system, global food availability would drop by a few percentage points. If the war would destabilize trade, it would magnify by several times the negative ramifications of land productivity shocks on food availability. If exporting countries redirect production to domestic consumption at the expense of importing countries, it would lead to the destabilization of international trade. The analysis suggests that economic models aiming to inform policymakers require both economic behavior analysis and biophysical drivers. Policy lessons derived from a crop model can be significantly nuanced when coupled with economic feedback derived from economic models. Through the impact on yield, farmers could shift production among crops and reallocate land use to maximize profits, showing the importance of general equilibrium effects such as product and input substitution and international trade. Although the global impact on corn and soybean production would be significant when just considering crop production, it could be considerably smaller under the economic model. However, this would be at the expense of other sectors, including livestock. In addition, the costs borne from disruptions to climate would vary significantly across regions, with significant adverse effects in high latitude regions. The severity of the shocks in the high-latitude areas would marginalize the farmers' product and input substitution ability."

The project deliverables have been executed concurrently with coursework in the CSM Space Resources program, specifically for the Space Resources Project I & II classes. A team was established in the fall semester of 2021 and a Systems Engineering process was followed to brainstorm initial concepts, determine objectives, flow down top-level requirements, and identify areas for which the project could best further the understanding of the overall system through targeted detailed design and design evaluation testing. This report summarizes the overall project, as well as specific work completed in the spring semester of 2022.

The approach contains extensive calibration of temperature-dependent system response. The Raman spectra of several cold and hot calibration flames and their resulting calibration matrix are elaborated. The structure of H2-CO2-air tubular flames, in terms of major species (CO2, O2, N2, H2O, and H2) concentrations and temperature, was successfully measured with the optical technique. The Raman spectra data used in this study are taken from a uniquely designed experimental apparatus – a tubular

The characteristic uncertainties for chemical species are approximately ±2% by mole fraction for hot products and ±0.5% for room temperature reactants.

We constrained ion precipitation onto the surface using distributions for the cusp regions that are consistent with measurements by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging Fast Imaging Plasma Spectrometer instrument. We have simulated sputtering with SBEs of 0.27, 2.6, 4.4, and 7.9 eV, with the lowest value commonly used in exosphere models and the highest from recent molecular dynamics calculations for the Na-bearing feldspar end-member, albite. A gradual change in the exosphere is seen as the yield decreases and the ejecta energy increases with increasing SBE. We describe the corresponding exosphere source functions for ion sputtering (IS), as well as for the previously studied processes of micrometeoroid impact vaporization and photon-stimulated desorption (PSD), along with their release energy distributions and spatial distributions. We have summed the contributions of the various source processes to explain how and when the different sources can be distinguished by observations. The modeled exosphere scale heights range from 72 km for PSD to over 1000 km for IS using a SBE of 7.9 eV. We find that the processes responsible for generating Mercury's Na exosphere are separable by measuring line-of-sight column densities tangent to the planet at various altitudes and positions around the planet. Our initial results are consistent with the Na being sputtered from a high-SBE material such as feldspar, which has been predicted to be abundant on the Mercury's surface."

freshwater input from land and through the Bering Strait, where the mean currents
transport water northward from the Bering Sea. The Yukon River is one of the largest
rivers in North America and the Arctic, contributing large quantities of freshwater and
terrigenous material to the coastal ocean in the northern Bering Sea. However, a detailed
analysis of the coastal hydrodynamics at the outflow of the river has not been conducted
in this remote but regionally important river. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model
was built to represent the lower Yukon River and coastal ocean for the ice-free months
in 7 years. On average, a large anticyclonic eddy persisted at the main outflow of
the Yukon that recirculates water back toward the coast where the currents converge
to form a mean northward transport along the delta. Interannual spatial variance in
salinity was relatively small, while there was substantial variance in u and v current
velocity. u velocity spatial variance was correlated to the volume of freshwater discharge
across years, while v velocity spatial variance was correlated to the N–S wind velocity.
During strong wind events, plume structure was substantially altered: southerly winds
deepened the plume and enhanced northward transport, while northerly winds shoaled
and strengthened the pycnocline, and reversed the flow toward the south. The variability
in plume dispersion on short time scales due to wind forcing has implications for where
terrigenous material is processed in and settles out of the water column."

This map was generated using data from the Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer. This map required corrections for variations due to rare-earth elements, and was calibrated to Apollo sample hydrogen abundances. Since neutron-derived measurements sample hydrogen content to a depth of tens of cm, these results provide complementary insights to those provided by studies using spectral reflectance data, which sample depths of order μm. Comparison of these abundances to Apollo sample values suggest that the samples reflect actual hydrogen content on the lunar surface, not dominantly from non-lunar contamination. The average lunar hydrogen abundance is 47 ppm with a systematic uncertainty of ∼10 ppm. This is consistent with bulk hydrogen from solar wind emplacement. A bulk hydrogen enhancement (50–68 ppm) has been identified at the Moon's largest pyroclastic deposit (Aristarchus Plateau), which corroborates prior observations that hydrogen and/or water plays a role in lunar magmatic events. Global data show a correlation between hydrogen and evolved materials rich in incompatible trace elements (i.e., KREEP type rocks), with a hydrogen excess of 14–36 ppm in these materials. Based on this hydrogen enhancement, we estimate a lower-limit water abundance within urKREEP materials (i.e., the final ∼2% of the lunar magma ocean) of 320–820 ppm H2O. This observation implies that water played a role in the original magma-ocean formation and solidification with a lower-limit water content in the original lunar magma ocean of 7–16 ppm or higher."

The algorithm from sections 5.4.2 and 7 of ISO 11204 is customized using six nonstandard correction grades in addition to implementing the two standardized grades described in ISO 11204. The six nonstandard grades allow for more aggressive correction of the levels of the sonic boom spectrum when they are proximate to the ambient spectrum. Of the eight correction grades, the most aggressive custom correction grade, termed “Custom F” here, performed best under the conditions that were studied. Consequently, “Custom F” is recommended for use when processing in-field recordings of X-59 sonic booms.

To evaluate the eight correction grades, mock X-59 acoustic recordings were generated using predicted ground-level X-59 sonic booms. These ground-level waveforms were created by Doebler [2] by propagating nearfield CFD solutions of the X-59 C612A configuration to the ground using PCBoom [3] (please see Acknowledgements and Refs. [4, 5, 2, 6]). To generate the mock acoustic recordings from those ground-level waveforms, they were further modified using turbulence filters developed during the NASA SonicBAT effort [7], post boom noise audio clips from the NASA SonicBAT tests [7], and ambient noise from the NASA QSF18 test [8, 9]. These mock acoustic recordings enabled evaluation of the ambient noise mitigation methods since the proper loudness levels of the X-59 waveforms in absence of ambient noise are known. Specifically, these known levels provide a benchmark against which the corrected loudness levels are compared, where the corrected loudness levels are computed when ambient noise is present within the waveforms. Importantly, similar analyses using in-field recordings are not possible since the proper loudness levels of the sonic boom waveforms in absence of ambient noise are unknowable when analyzing in-field recordings. Consequently, if additional analyses of ambient noise mitigation methods are needed, then use of mock recordings like those used here is recommended."

In  bothbands the images reveal a tail-like PWN morphology which can be attributed to pulsar’s motion.  Bycomparing archival and newCXOobservations, we measure the pulsar’s proper motionμ= 28.8±7.3mas yr−1, yielding a projected pulsar velocityv≈440±110 km s−1(atd= 3.2 kpc); its direction isconsistent with the PWN shape.  Radio emission from the PWN is polarized, with the magnetic fieldoriented along the pulsar tail.  The radio tail connects to a larger radio structure (not seen in X-rays)which we interpret as a relic PWN (also known as a plerion).  The spectral analysis of theCXOdatashows that the PWN spectrum softens from Γ = 1.7 to Γ≈2.3−2.5 with increasing distance fromthe pulsar.  The softening can be attributed to the rapid synchrotron burn-off, which would explainthe lack of X-ray emission from the older relic PWN. In addition to non-thermal PWN emission, wedetected thermal emission from a hot plasma which we attribute to the host SNR. The radio PWNmorphology and the proper motion of the pulsar suggest that the reverse shock passed through thepulsar’s vicinity and pushed the PWN to one side."

A prime complication in analysis of the spectroscopic feature is the accurate removal of thermal emission, which can modify or even eliminate the hydration feature depending on the data processing methods used and assumptions made. An orbital multispectral lidar, with laser illumination at key diagnostic wavelengths, would provide uniform, zero-phase geometry, complete latitude and time of day coverage from a circular polar orbit, and is agnostic to the thermal state of the surface. We have performed measurement simulations of a four-wavelength multispectral lidar using spectral mixtures of hydrated mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) glasses and lunar regolith endmembers to assess the lidar performance in measuring hydration signatures on the lunar surface. Our results show a feasible system with wavelengths at 1.5 µm, 2.65 µm, 2.8 µm, and 3.1 µm can measure lunar hydration with a precision of 52 ppm (1σ) or better. These results, combined with the uniform measurement capabilities of multispectral lidar make it a valuable spectroscopic technique for elucidating mechanisms of OH/H2O generation, migration, and destruction."

Using  the dense  media  radiative  transfer  theory,  this  article  studies  the potential  effects  of  terrestrial  snow-cover  depth,  density,  and6grain   size   on   high-frequency   channels   89   and   166   GHz   of the  radiometer  onboard  the  Global  Precipitation  Measurement (GPM)  core  satellite,  which  are  commonly  used  to  capture  the snowfall  scattering  signals.  Integrating  the  inference  across  all feasible  grain  sizes,  ranges  of  snowpack  density  and  depth  are identified   over   which   the   snowfall   scattering   signatures   can be  time  varying  and  potentially  obscured.  Using  10  years  of reanalysis  data,  the  seasonal  vulnerability  of  snowfall  retrievals to changes of snowpack emissivity in the Northern Hemisphere is mapped  in  a  probabilistic  sense  and  connections  are  made  with uncertainties of the GPM passive microwave snowfall retrievals. It  is  found  that  among  different  snow  classes,  relatively  light Arctic  tundra  snow  in  fall,  with  a  density  below  260kg m−3, and  shallow  prairie  snow  during  the  winter,  with  a  depth  of less  than  40cm,  can  reduce  the  surface  emissivity  and  obscure the  snowfall  passive  microwave  signatures.  It  is  demonstrated that,  during  the  winter,  the  highly  vulnerable  areas  are  over Kazakhstan,  and  Mongolia  with  taiga  and  prairie  snow.  In  the fall, these areas are largely over tundra and taiga snow in north of Russia and the Arctic Archipelagos as well as prairies in Canada and  the  Great  Plains  in  the  United  States."

This SDA is used to measure upwelling radiation in seven discrete bands from 940 to 2260 nm. There are redundant measurements of each band for a total of 32 physical channels, which includes optical components through to detection. The relative spectral response (RSR) is measured for each channel, which is needed when accounting for the spectral distribution of sensed radiance. From the RSR, single-value performance metrics are computed including the center wavelength, the full width at half of the maximum (FWHM), and the full width at 1% of the maximum (FW1P). Besides in-band responses, the out-of-band rejection ratio (OOBRR) is also calculated for each of the channels, which is a measure of the sensitivity outside the band of interest. We find that all 32 SDA detection channels meet the spectral response requirements at the qualification temperatures at which tests were conducted."

Using expert knowledge elicitation, we explored interactions among seven variables representing Earth system processes relevant to food production, identifying many interactions little explored in Earth system literature. We found that green water and land system change affect other Earth system processes strongly, while land, freshwater and ocean components of biosphere integrity are the most impacted by other Earth system processes, most notably blue water and biogeochemical flows. We also mapped a complex network of mechanisms mediating these interactions and created a future research prioritization scheme based on interaction strengths and existing knowledge gaps. Our study improves the understanding of Earth system interactions, with sustainability implications including improved Earth system modelling and more explicit biophysical limits for future food production."

This document has been prepared for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in accordance with HydroGeoLogic, Inc.’s (HGL) Contract 80KSC019D0012, Task Order 80KSC019F0224. The purpose of this IM report is to document the field results of the 2022 IM conducted between December 13, 2021, and February 11, 2022, and to present the recommendations based on the IM findings.

IM activities were completed at the UNOA PRL 229 to remove railroad ties and benzo(a)pyrene equivalent (BAPE)/total recoverable petroleum hydrocarbons (TRPH)-affected soil in accordance with the IM Work Plan (IMWP) (Jacobs/CORE, 2019a). The objectives of the IM were to mitigate human health risks by reducing site contaminants to the residential soil cleanup target level (SCTL) based on the 95 percent upper confidence limit on the mean. A second objective was to reduce low molecular weight and high molecular weight polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations below ecological screening values for terrestrial receptors.

Prior to excavation operations, railroad ties from all areas were consolidated. In total, 50.67 tons of railroad ties were transported from the site to JED Landfill in St. Cloud, Florida. The cumulative excavation footprint spanned an area of 9,710 square ft. In total, 908.54 tons of soil was transported from the site to JED Landfill.  

To backfill the excavation area, 880 cubic yards of clean fill was trucked to the site from S&LMaterials, Inc. borrow pit in Christmas, Florida. Following completion of backfill, the site restoration activities included grading the disturbed areas to match the existing elevations and vegetation planting by the site restoration subcontractor.

The IM implementation activities were presented to the KSC Remediation Team during its meeting on May 3, 2022. The Remediation Team reached consensus on the completion of the IM reducing the area affected by BAPE/TRPH above the State of Florida residential soil cleanup target levels."

KHQA has been designated Solid Waste Management Unit (SWMU) 104 under KSC’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program.  The IM consisted of excavating/removing residual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in soil and concrete from two separate areas, LOC 2D and LOC 2E, which were associated with electrical transformer locations. IM activities were conducted in accordance with the Interim Measure Work Plan (IMWP), Revision 1, for KHQA dated June 2018, which was approved by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in a correspondence letter dated April 2016 and the United States Environmental Protection Agency in a correspondence letter dated August 2018.

The objective of the IM was to remove all remaining contaminated media with total PCB concentrations greater than the State of Florida Residential Soil Cleanup Target Level (RSCTL) (0.5 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg]). This cleanup goal meets unrestrictive re-use conditions in Florida, and is below federal regulations for PCB Bulk Remediation Waste Cleanup of 1 mg/kg for high occupancy, unrestricted use areas, as outlined in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 761.61(a). The timeline of the IM was coordinated with demolition of the former KSC Headquarters Building (demolished in 2021) in order to safely remove contaminated media after electrical equipment was de-energized and removed from the site.

Excavation activities were conducted between January 10, 2022, and February 8, 2022, and included two waste streams for off-site disposal: (1) PCB-remediation waste greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg, and (2) PCB-remediation waste less than 50 mg/kg. A total of approximately 347 cubic yards (478 tons) of PCB-contaminated soil and concrete was initially removed from the LOC 2D and LOC 2E areas, as defined in the IMWP. An additional 4.35 tons of soil and concrete were removed based on verification sampling, which was conducted until the cleanup goal was achieved. The total area of excavation from both LOC 2D and LOC 2E was approximately 5,186 square feet (0.12 acres), and excavation depths ranged from 0.5 to 4.0 feet below land surface  Excavated soils and concrete were stockpiled based on waste stream and subsequently transported and disposed of at Waste Connections of Osceola County, LLC – JED Landfill in St. Cloud, Florida (PCBs less than 50 mg/kg) or the Chemical Waste Management Landfill in Emelle, Alabama (PCBs greater than or equal to 50 mg/kg). Following  excavation, clean backfill was brought to the site and provided to the Demolition Contractor to complete backfill and grading in conjunction with their final site restoration activities from building demolition.

Post-IM groundwater sampling was conducted in May 2022 at three monitoring wells installed in April 2022 to confirm that PCBs did not leach into groundwater. These wells were installed where the highest PCB concentrations were detected at LOC 2D, LOC 2E, and from the Building Perimeter IM (previously completed in 2020). All PCB results in groundwater were non-detect. Volatile organic compounds were also analyzed based on potential past use of solvents in transformers with PCB-dielectric fluids and the potential release of dielectric fluids containing volatile organic compounds, and all results were non-detect.

Based on completion of a successful IM at LOC 2D and LOC 2E, as well as previous remedial actions that have addressed other contamination at KHQA (SWMU 104), No Further Action without controls will be recommended for SWMU 104. NASA will submit separate Site Rehabilitation Completion Order request documentation for SWMU 104 to support an NFA without controls recommendation."

The activity focuses on contamination containment gloveboxes, which are sealed containers where operators outside the glovebox can safely manipulate hazardous or contamination-sensitive materials inside the glovebox through glove ports on the container. The activity utilizes common household materials and teams of students work together to design and build a glovebox using the materials provided. Once the glovebox has been constructed, students perform a task under a time constraint by using their glovebox to assemble a puzzle “contaminated” with corn starch. In a post-activity debrief, teams discuss lessons learned such as how the actual built glovebox differed from the sketched design, the challenge of managing a budget for materials, how the team dealt with surprises, and if their glovebox allowed enough room for the operator to perform the task. This activity has been part of VSGC’s Virginia Earth System Science Scholars (VESSS) summer academy program for high school students since 2016, and has been an engaging method to teach students teamwork, creativity, hands-on experimentation, communication, and reasoning skills while also teaching them about unique engineering fields such as contamination control and planetary protection."

Expansions to the fields of view offered by current X-ray, extreme ultraviolet and coronagraph instruments, to obtain increased coverage of the solar corona and heliosphere, from vantage points off the Sun-Earth line, are desired for model input. New observations of suprathermal particles are needed to characterize seed particle distributions and low latency space-based observations of solar radio emissions are also desired. Together, this observational suite should offer high cadence, low latency, reliable and accurate space weather data streams. Consistent, extensive and quantitative model validation is required to assess scientific advancements and pave the way for models transitioning to real-time forecast operations. Model performance and skill should be compared to observations and to current operational forecasting baselines. Finally, resources are required to support the significant effort of transitioning mature models into forecast operations."

The Corporación Nacional Forestal (CONAF) responds to wildfires caused by a variety of ignitions, including lightning, but it is difficult to determine the prevalence of lightning-ignited wildfires based solely on ground observations. In collaboration with CONAF and the Embassy of Chile, Agricultural Office, the team used Earth observations to map coincidence of lightning strikes and wildfire ignitions. The Active Fire Product of Suomi NPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) identified wildfires as thermal anomalies, which the team compared to the lightning events detected by NOAA’s GOES-16 Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM). Next, the team mapped lightning strike frequency and lightning related wildfires across the study area. Finally, the team calculated and mapped a relative estimate of lightning-ignited wildfire vulnerability across the year, fire season (December – March), and off-season (April – November) by summing the following factors: lightning frequency, the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and land surface temperature (LST). These risks were then weighted by fuel availability. Preliminary analysis of the lightning fire relationship showed a spatiotemporal coincidence, primarily in the South-central region of study, near Temuco, and isolated areas on the Andean front. The team identified areas at risk of lightning-induced wildfires, predominantly in the northern third of the study area and along the Andean front. Adjusting the relative weight of risk factors and improving the lightning and fire coincidence map by clustering VIIRS thermal anomalies into fire events could reduce discrepancies and improve risk assessments for future work."

Under new regulations (Digital Flight Rules, DFR) that set requirements for its sustained use, qualified operators employ Digital Flight to enhance their airspace access and operational flexibility in all visibility conditions and eventually all airspace classes without requiring segregation from incumbent operations. Enabled by connected digital information and technologies, Digital Flight operators employ cooperative practices and self-separation to ensure flight path safety in lieu of visual procedures or receiving separation services from Air Traffic Control. Its distributed structure and automated functions enable traffic densities and operational tempos not achievable with the existing operating modes. Various ongoing and emerging industry initiatives for enabling new entrants (e.g., unmanned aircraft systems, urban air taxis) and enhanced use of underserved airspace (e.g., ultra-high altitude), are pursuing various alternative operating modes with significant similarities, creating a unique and time-limited opportunity for harmonization and convergence. Digital Flight is proposed to serve that harmonizing role, creating a common new paradigm for airspace operations. Such convergence would not only bring together these emerging market segments but will also bolster the existing operators with access to this new operating mode and its advantages. Digital Flight provides an opportunity to focus regulatory development and benefit the aviation industry. This paper describes Digital Flight in sufficient detail to initiate community engagement and deliberation on a common new operating mode. It describes the essential elements, principal capabilities, and operational integration of DFR in shared airspace. It describes the value proposition from multiple perspectives and presents initial thoughts on the path forward."

We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to determine the detailed structure and dynamics of open-closed interactions that are driven by photospheric convective flows. The photospheric magnetic field model includes a global dipole giving rise to a streamer together with a large parasitic polarity region giving rise to a pseudostreamer that separates a satellite coronal hole from the main polar hole. Our numerical domain extends out to 30Rꙩ and includes an isothermal solar wind, so that the coupling between the corona and heliosphere can be calculated rigorously. This system is driven by imposing a large set of quasi-random surface flows that capture the driving of coronal flux in the vicinity of streamer and pseudostreamer boundaries by the supergranular motions. We describe the resulting structures and dynamics. Interchange reconnection dominates the evolution at both streamer and pseudostreamer boundaries, but the details of the resulting structures are clearly different from one another. Additionally, we calculate in situ signatures of the reconnection and determine the dynamic mapping from the inner heliosphere back to the Sun for a test spacecraft orbit. We discuss the implications of our results for interpreting observations from inner heliospheric missions, such as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, and for space weather modeling of the slow solar wind."

The aim of this article is to explore the dynamics of interchange magnetic reconnection at different types of coronal hole boundaries—namely streamers and pseudostreamers—and their implications for the coronal structure. We describe synthetic observables derived from three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the atmosphere of the Sun in which coronal hole boundaries are disturbed by flows that mimic the solar supergranulation. Our analysis shows that interchange reconnection takes place much more readily at the pseudostreamer boundary of the coronal hole. As a result, the portion of the coronal hole boundary formed by the pseudostreamer remains much smoother, in contrast to the highly distorted helmet-streamer portion of the coronal hole boundary. Our results yield important new insights on coronal hole boundary regions, which are critical in coupling the corona to the heliosphere as the formation regions of the slow solar wind."

One SD-WACCM-X run was with realistic Kp and F10.7 and the other with constant Kp and F10.7. By comparing the day-to-day variability of thermosphere mass density at 300 km (low earth orbit, LEO) and 120 km (reentry level) in these two runs, we find that the density variation at 300 km is mainly driven by geomagnetic and solar forcing while at 120 km it is exclusively controlled by the lower atmosphere. At LEO altitudes, during solar minimum and geomagnetic quiet days, the impact from the lower atmosphere is much smaller than the effect of solar and geomagnetic variations but is not negligible (5–10% vs 20%)."

In this work, we apply organization metrics to describe tropical synoptic scale convective activity. Such activity is identified by cloud-precipitation (hybrid) regimes defined at 1-degree and 1-hourly resolution. Existing metrics were found to perform inadequately for such convective regime aggregates because the large domain size and co-existence of sparse aggregate occurrences with noisy isolated convection often violate assumptions inherent in these metrics. In order to capture these characteristics, in this study the existing “convective organization potential” (COP) metric was modified so as to focus on local organization and provide increased weight to aggregate size. The resulting “area-based COP” (ABCOP) follows the principle that the more numerous the objects, the higher the chance of organization. It is thus optimized to capture large-scale convective events occurring during phenomena such as ENSO and MJO, while also performs as well as existing metrics for small domain sizes."

Currently, global coverage SM is routinely produced from spaceborne measurements using all three frequency bands, but despite continued validation efforts of the products, the relative characteristics and performance of these observations have not been fully established. Therefore, this study focused on the parametrization of SM retrieval algorithms at L-, C- and X-bands using TB observations from the L-band radiometer on NASA's SM Active Passive (SMAP) mission and the C- and X-band channels of JAXA's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W satellite. These can be applied in global SM retrieval algorithms using either one of the frequencies or a combination of them. The reference in situ SM data was obtained from 12 core validation sites across various land cover types around the world. The investigation highlighted the known challenges of retrieving SM from C- and X-band data compared to the higher sensitivity of the L-band data. Even with a site-specific retrieval algorithm parameterization, the mean correlation of the C- and X-band retrievals for the core validation site SM measurement were much lower than that for L-band, being 0.52 (0.54) and 0.45 (0.47) for vertical (horizontal) polarization, respectively, while for the L-band retrieval the corresponding values were 0.81 (0.77). The parameterization exercise showed that matching the C- and X-band TB measurements with an emission model was not difficult; the problem was relating the observations to SM under the influence of large roughness and vegetation effects. As a result, parameter optimization produced values for some sites that were not realistic or did not allow any practical sensitivity to SM at C- and X-band. Considering the L-band observations, the parameter optimization resulted in superior bias performance as compared to the operational SMAP product parameterization, but the sensitivity to SM changes (R and unbiased root mean square difference) did not improve markedly, or in some cases degraded at the expense of a smaller bias."

Flare emission is the first component of a SEE to impact the Earth’s atmosphere which can set the stage for the later arrival of the associated SEPs, CME, and space weather event. Magnetic reconnection drives SEEs by restructuring the solar coronal magnetic field, liberating a tremendous amount of energy which is partitioned into various physical manifestations: particle acceleration, mass and magnetic-field eruption, atmospheric heating, and the subsequent emission of radiation as solar flares. In this white paper we discuss the observational and theoretical advances required in order to make substantial progress in understanding the physical processes acting during the gradual phase of a flare. That is, the decay period, following the initial rapid release of energy during the impulsive phase (see our other white paper). In particular we want to address the unknown processes that sustain the long decay phase of flares and identify the unknown mechanism and magnitude of continued energy injection during the gradual phase."

The goals of this report are to (1) provide an early hazard analysis and mitigation evaluation of wildfire response to support these efforts and (2) provide a demonstration of capabilities of the Fault Model Design Tools (fmdtools) and Manager for Intelligent Knowledge Access (MIKA) tools. fmdtools provides a modeling, simulation, and resiliency analysis framework in which a wildfire response model, the System Modeling and Analysis of Resiliency in Scalable Traffic Management for Emergency Response Operations (SMARt-STEReO), is built. MIKA is an intelligent knowledge manager with several capabilities, including assisting in hazard analysis by extracting and analyzing hazards from historical incident reports. The following topics are covered in the report:

Understanding Wildfire Hazard Dynamics. We provide a description and simulated examples of how hazards occur in the SMARt-STEReO model of wildfire response and their effect on its outcome. This provides a common mental model and focuses the analysis presented in the remainder of the report.

Wildfire Hazard Identification.  MIKA identifies wildfire hazards from three relevant datasets: the ICS-209-PLUS, SAFECOM, and SAFENET. Hazards are manually organized into a taxonomy and MIKA analyzes each hazard’s effects, likelihood, severity, and risk.

Evaluating Mitigation Strategies. The SMARt-STEReO wildfire response model built in fmdtools evaluates a subset of identified hazards. Specifically, we simulate the effect of communications faults and equipment faults on operator safety, the effect of changing winds and flammability, and a scenario with multiple ignition points and heavy smoke.

Tool Limitations and Usage Considerations. We provide a discussion of appropriate tool use cases as well as limitations and considerations for usage.

The tool findings are used to synthesize recommendations for wildfire response operations, which can be captured as part of an IASMS. Key recommendations are as follows:

Hazards are identified from a broad spectrum of sources including aircraft subsystems, operational sources, and ground crew operations. Highest risk operational environment hazards identified are Evacuations. The highest risk manned aerial operations hazard categorized is Jumper Operations Mishap. Ground crew hazards that are highest risk are Burns, Cargo Operations Overhead, Dehydration, Entrapment, Falling Objects, Heart Attacks, Heat Exhaustion, Inadequate Training or Certification, Vehicle Breakdown, and Vehicle Collision.

Modelled containment failures arise from a mismatch between the difficulty of the firefighting scenario and the capacity (e.g., speed, effectiveness, awareness) of the response. In firefighting scenarios where containment is possible (e.g., because the fire does not spread too quickly), these mismatches can occur because of a change in environmental conditions (e.g., wind, flammability, etc) or because of planning, equipment, or communications faults.

Improvements to communications increase the capacity of the firefighting response by reducing the time needed to respond to the fire. While surveillance does not increase this capacity by itself, it increases operator safety by increasing state awareness, enabling firefighters to evade approaching fires. Increasing both has a synergistic effect. In general, these performance and resilience increases generalize over fault scenarios as well as unforeseen changes to circumstances (i.e., wind, aridity, etc.). However, these improvements need to be designed so as not to make the system prone to persistent large-scale communications outages, which can reduce performance."

Most of the improvements in meeting the ozone air quality metrics (NAAQS) did not occur until the early 2000s despite large reductions in ozone precursors (NOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) in the prior decades. We use observations of ozone and ozone precursors from satellites, ground-based sites, and the 2011 DISCOVER-AQ aircraft campaign in Maryland to illustrate how ozone chemistry in the BWR evolved between 1972 and 2019. Analysis of weekday vs weekend probability of ozone exceedance indicates the BWR transitioned to the NOx-limited regime by 2000–2003. A data-constrained box model agrees with this transition period and illustrates the key roles of reduced emissions of formaldehyde (HCHO), aromatics, and other VOCs since 1996, which reduced the peak of ozone production at the time of the transition and likely prevented the BWR from experiencing worsening surface air quality as the region transitioned to NOx-limited chemistry. Analysis of satellite observations of tropospheric column HCHO to NO2 analyzed using a new approach for evaluation of chemical regimes derived from DISCOVER-AQ data also provide a consistent depiction of the timing of the transition period that we infer from ground-based observations and the box model. Finally, despite significant improvements in air quality over the past two decades, the BWR still has not met the EPA standard for surface ozone. With predominantly NOx-limited ozone chemistry over the BWR, continued decreases in emission of NOx will slow the rate of ozone production and help improve air quality. We highlight emissions of NO2 from the diesel truck fleet as a worthwhile focus for future policy because emissions from this source appear to influence day-of-week variations in observed NO2, with an accompanying effect on ozone."

To make these predictions, methods have been developed to derive the true CME speed, size, position, and mass, among others. Difficulties in determining the input parameters for CME forecasting models arise from the lack of direct measurements of the coronal magnetic fields and uncertainties in estimating the CME 3D geometric and kinematic parameters after eruption.  White-light coronagraph images are usually employed by a variety of CME reconstruction techniques that assume more or less complex geometries. This is the first study from our International Space Science Institute (ISSI) team “Understanding Our Capabilities in Observing and Modeling Coronal Mass Ejections”, in which we explore how subjectivity affects the 3D CME parameters that are obtained from the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) reconstruction technique, which is widely used in CME research. To be able to quantify such uncertainties, the “true” values that are being fitted should be known, which are impossible to derive from observational data. We have designed two different synthetic scenarios where the “true” geometric parameters are known in order to quantify such uncertainties for the first time. We explore this by using two sets of synthetic data: 1) Using the ray-tracing option from the GCS model software itself, and 2) Using 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation data from the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere code. Our experiment includes different viewing configurations using single and multiple viewpoints. CME reconstructions using a single viewpoint had the largest errors and error ranges overall for both synthetic GCS and simulated MHD white-light data. As the number of viewpoints increased from one to two, the errors decreased by approximately 4° in latitude, 22° in longitude, 14° in tilt, and 10° in half-angle. Our results quantitatively show the critical need for at least two viewpoints to be able to reduce the uncertainty in deriving CME parameters. We did not find a significant decrease in errors when going from two to three viewpoints for our specific hypothetical three spacecraft scenario using synthetic GCS white-light data. As we expected, considering all configurations and numbers of viewpoints, the mean absolute errors in the measured CME parameters are generally significantly higher in the case of the simulated MHD white-light data compared to those from the synthetic white-light images generated by the GCS model. We found the following CME parameter error bars as a starting point for quantifying the minimum error in CME parameters from white-light reconstructions: Δθ (latitude)=6°<sup>+2°</sup><sub>-3°</sub>, Δϕ (longitude)=11°<sup>+18°</sup><sub>-6°</sub>, Δγ (tilt)=25°<sup>+8°</sup><sub>-7°</sub>, Δx (half-angle)=10°<sup>+12°</sup><sub>-6°</sub>, Δh (height)=0.6<sup>+1.2</sup><sub>-0.4</sub> R<sub>⨀</sub>, and Δκ (ratio)=0.1<sup>+0.03</sup><sub>-0.02</sub>."

Each route is described by a discrete probability distribution over trip completion times (or delay) and over interarrival times of requests (or demand) for the route along with a fixed hard or soft deadline. Soft deadlines carry a cost that is incurred when the deadline is missed. An online, safe scheduler is developed that ensures that hard deadlines are never missed and that average cost of missing soft deadlines is minimized. The system is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and safe model based learning is used to find the probabilistic distributions over route delays and demand. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is used to safely explore the learned models in an online fashion and develop a near-optimal non-preemptive scheduling policy. These results are compared with Value Iteration (VI) and MCTS (Random) scheduling solutions."

Global observations of OH from satellite instruments have a role to play in the study of OH and water vapor variations. This study describes an advanced algorithm to detect mesospheric OH emission profiles from the Suomi NPP satellite Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS/LP). A triplet technique has been adapted to the OMPS/LP radiance measurements for determining OH emission signatures and OH index (OHI) from the OH A2Σ+-X2Π 0-0 band near the 308.8-nm wavelength. The derived mesospheric profiles provide an overall picture of the vertical distribution of OHI between 55 and 84 km and seasonal and latitudinal variability of the strength and height of the OHI. The observed annual cycle is correlated with the water vapor cycle and anticorrelated with the mesospheric temperature cycle. The data show that the relationships persist during the period of April 2012–December 2020. The seasonal behavior of OHI may be associated with variations in solar illumination or mesospheric water vapor abundance. The influence of solar illumination is dominant in the midlatitudes, while the OHI pattern is dominated by water vapor photolysis and other influences in the tropics."

The CSR summarizes investigation activities performed on the Railroad Tie Disposal Area (RTDA) of the Un-Numbered Operational Areas (UNOA), Potential Release Location (PRL) 229 located at KSC.  HydroGeoLogic, Inc. (HGL) prepared this report under Contract Number 80KSC019D0012.  

The purpose of the CSR is to provide information to evaluate the level of potential contamination in surface water and sediment samples collected from the RTDA PRL 229 Pond and determine if contaminants pose unacceptable risks to ecological receptors. The CSR provides analytical data of 10 sets of surface water and sediment samples collected in 2021. Surface water samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), metals, hardness, and salinity, while sediment samples were analyzed for metals, total organic carbon (TOC), SVOCs, PAHs, and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). The CSR includes a Screening Level Ecological Risk Assessment (SLERA) conducted under KSC’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action Program to determine if unacceptable risks to ecological receptors exist at PRL 229 Pond.

Metals and PAHs were detected in surface water samples, including detections of antimony, arsenic, barium, calcium, copper, lead, magnesium, thallium, zinc, anthracene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, fluoranthene, indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene and pyrene. Based on measured salinity (1.03 to 1.21 parts per thousand), the pond was identified as freshwater. Sediment analytical results also contained detections of metals and PAHs, including antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, thallium, zinc, anthracene benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, fluoranthene, indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene and pyrene.

Potential risks to ecological receptors were evaluated in accordance with the SLERA Work Plan and the Decision Process Document for the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action Program at KSC (DPD) (Geosyntec, 2019), and using the 2021 sediment and surface water analytical results. Potential ecological receptors evaluated in the SLERA include the aquatic community, benthic
invertebrates, aquatic birds, and aquatic mammals. The SLERA included Steps 2a through 2c of the Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) process in accordance with the DPD.  Using multiple lines of evidence, the SLERA concluded that many of the detected analytes are present at concentrations similar to those in background or reference locations at KSC, and/or at concentrations that would not pose a significant risk to ecological communities. There are no screening values available for the avian community, and PAHs are bioaccumulative compounds. For this reason, food web modeling was completed as a supplement to Step 2c to provide a quantitative evaluation of this exposure pathway. Food web modeling indicates that PAHs are unlikely to pose a risk to birds exposed to site sediment and surface water. Based on the results of the SLERA, the contaminants in sediment and surface water pose no to minimal risk to the ecological communities that could live or forage at the site. Based on the results of the SLERA, no further study is recommended for the RTDA Pond at PRL 229."

Here we document the Large Ensemble Single Forcing Model Intercomparison Project that will address this need through coordinated model experiments enabling the impacts of different external drivers to be isolated. We highlight the need to account for model errors and propose an attribution approach that exploits differences between models to diagnose the real-world situation and overcomes potential errors in atmospheric circulation changes.

In collaboration with partners from the United States Forest Service (USFS) Black Hills Experimental Forest, USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station, and United States Geological Survey Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center, we characterized post-fire forest regeneration within high-severity burn patches. We accomplished this by implementing novel conifer detection techniques using a snow index mask to create a winter, snow-on image composite from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. We utilized 2015 USFS stem maps of field-observed regeneration plots and ocularly sampled additional reforestation sites planted in 2001–2013. In Google Earth Engine (GEE), the field data and imagery were used to train a Random Forest (RF) model. The RF model classified 2021 conifer regeneration density as low, medium, or high across the high-severity burn area with an overall accuracy of 81.3%. Approximately 45.9% of the high-severity burn had low or no regeneration (0-40 trees per acre) 20 years post-fire. Given our partners' desire to find easily accessible low conifer regeneration zones, we identified 4,079 acres of priority planting sites that were within 1,500 feet of roads, had not been planted previously, and were larger than 50 acres. This method supports the use of snow-on imagery as a successful technique to identify conifer regeneration."

This enabled a better understanding of how NASA and community expertise can be leveraged in the safe development of current and future firefighting systems and operations. The goals of the workshop were to: (1) identify and prioritize the top safety-oriented risks, gaps in capabilities, and emerging technologies to enhance wildland firefighting for both near-term and far-term concepts, with a specific focus on aviation operations  and (2) engage the stakeholder community in defining emergent safety-oriented scope, roles, responsibilities, and procedures for agents undergoing increasingly complex wildland firefighting operations in information-rich, but uncertain environments. Workshop participants were solicited from wildland firefighting stakeholders across government, industry, and academia. All levels of government were engaged, as NASA sought attendees from federal, state, local, and tribal government agencies. Industry participants from traditional wildland firefighting domains such as data visualization and equipment manufacturers were invited, and corporate attendees from novel application domains such as aerial robotics and autonomous systems were present as well. The top three findings were as follows: (1) Enhancing situation awareness is a safety priority, especially in the use of aerial assets; (2) Timely access to information along with data fusion and integrated displays will enhance safety-critical decision-making both inside and outside aviation contexts; and (3) Tailorable standards and common operating pictures in the field will enhance inter-agency cooperation in the wildland firefighting lifecycle and enable the optimal use of limited resources such as aerial assets. The workshop helped inform NASA of the relevant safety-related wildland firefighting concerns and aided the broader ecosystem in understanding the potential safety-oriented role NASA might play in this community. Increased engagement with crucial governmental stakeholders (e.g., U.S. Forest Service, CAL FIRE, etc.) along with industry partners in cutting- edge information -centric domains is a fundamental next step. Additionally, the workshop findings will help define the first of a series of operationally challenging demonstrations, held in concert with strategic ecosystem partners, known as the Safety Demonstrator Series for NASA’s System-Wide Safety project. The first demonstration is set in the wildland firefighting application domain and will: (1) examine high risk operational scenarios to reduce their overall risk via services, functions or capabilities that act as risk mitigators (or transfer that risk to automated systems better able to tolerate it) and (2) explore novel tools and technologies that will enhance safety margins by enabling non-traditional or neoteric operational paradigms."

The reported results show that Ryugu samples are similar to CI chondritesin chemistry and mineralogy, showing evidence for aqueous alteration in the parent body [e.g., 2,3]. As a “stone” team of the initial  analysis, we received  18coarse particles (>1  mm) of  Ryugu samples to characterize their mineralogy and petrology. We found that the samples were breccias of mm-to-sub mm size clasts. All of the clasts are mainly composed of Mg-Fe phyllosilicates, but the alteration degree appears slightly different from one clast to another. Here we report a lithological variation of Ryugu samples to propose their reasonable lithological classification based upon different mineral assemblages and to discuss the formation and evolution of the Ryugu parent body."

This study analyzes the long-term averages of aerosol optical and radiative properties obtained by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) version 3 at four sites in Indonesia representing fire prone areas (Palangka Raya, Pontianak, Jambi: 2012–2020), and urban-industrial (Bandung: 2009–2018). We examined the seasonal variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom Exponent (AE), Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV), and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) combined with meteorological parameters at these Indonesian sites. Multiple clustering techniques from different relationships among various aerosol optical and radiative parameters was employed to further study the aerosol type in respect to different seasonality. The results exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern at all sites except Bandung, whereas AOD increased owing to forest and peat fire outbreaks during the dry season. The trend in AOD annual depicts an increase in Bandung as emission from urban/industrial increases episodically, while it depicts a decrease at the three biomass burning sites. As AOD increased, Palangka Raya, Pontianak, and Jambi exhibited wider ranges of observed AE (1.2–1.8) and high FMF (>0.8) in the dry burning period (June to October). On the other hand, Bandung has more aerosol distribution in the range of FMF values 0.6–1 and AE 1–1.6, compared with other sites, suggesting contribution of complex aerosol emission from different sources and likely due to the formation of secondary aerosol production from trace gases. Palangka Raya, Pontianak, and Jambi exhibited non-absorbing characteristics, as indicated by high SSA (>0.95), high FMF, and high EAE values (1.2–1.7) with no discrepancy in seasonal patterns, implying that biomass burning aerosols in Indonesia tend to cool the atmosphere with strong scattering rather than absorbing. At Bandung, aerosols mixed with slightly absorbing and non-absorbing aerosols owing to urban and industrial emissions. This study lays a foundation for further research on the contribution of aerosol radiative forcing to climate within the complex aerosol and cloud environments in Indonesia."

who in a relatively short time are exposed to a broad range of experiences and opportunities
available in space science and other STEM fields. In particular, mission-funded science offers a
relatively stable funding stream that enables meaningful mentoring efforts and interactions,
including apprenticeships ranging from project management, to mission operations, to data
processing and analysis, to hardware and software development, to STEM-related education and
outreach. It moreover provides professional contacts that fuel diversity in mission leadership and
in the science and technical workforce at-large. Last but not least, it sustains the scientific
productivity of NASA’s missions, which constitute major national investments meriting their full
exploitation. Budgets cuts, however, are exercising pressure on the science and operations of the
extended mission fleet despite being only a small portion of the overall Division budget.

The history of Heliophysics has demonstrated that maintaining the operation of missions beyond
their prime phase invariably leads to a much deeper knowledge of the original mission science
goals, together with new applications often not foreseen during their original design. Their
operation as part of the Heliophysics System Observatory (HSO)---a coordinated, 1eliophysics,
multipoint observing system of the heliosphere, is a prime example. Some of the first activities
undertaken by the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter missions required recreating the larger
context of their new observations by using the diversity of HSO mission capabilities. The marginal
cost of maintaining this valuable, working science resource, in the form of both continuing high
quality data access and expertise, is small compared to the cost of the original missions or of new missions to achieve similar objectives, making the operation of extended missions, the best “science per dollar” investment in Heliophysics.

We argue that reducing both extended mission operations and science budgets will have a ripple
effect across the community, including reducing employment and training opportunities for young
scientists, to lowering the quality/impact of the Heliophysics Systems Observatory. Instead, we
suggest that the proposal process for mission extension should be re-examined. We offer several
ideas for reducing costs of extended missions toward maintaining science output and streamlining the management process."

This has motivated efforts to inventory, monitor, and forecast flash drought events. Here we consider the question of whether the term “flash drought” comprises multiple distinct classes of event, which would imply that understanding and forecasting flash droughts might require more than one framework. To do this, we first extend and evaluate a soil moisture volatility–based flash drought definition that we introduced in previous work and use it to inventory the onset dates and severity of flash droughts across the contiguous United States (CONUS) for the period 1979–2018. Using this inventory, we examine meteorological and land surface conditions associated with flash drought onset and recovery. These same meteorological and land surface conditions are then used to classify the flash droughts based on precursor conditions that may represent predictable drivers of the event. We find that distinct classes of flash drought can be diagnosed in the event inventory. Specifically, we describe three classes of flash drought: “dry and demanding” events for which antecedent evaporative demand is high and soil moisture is low, “evaporative” events with more modest antecedent evaporative demand and soil moisture anomalies, but positive antecedent evaporative anomalies, and “stealth” flash droughts, which are different from the other two classes in that precursor meteorological anomalies are modest relative to the other classes. The three classes exhibit somewhat different geographic and seasonal distributions. We conclude that soil moisture flash droughts are indeed a composite of distinct types of rapidly intensifying droughts, and that flash drought analyses and forecasts would benefit from approaches that recognize the existence of multiple phenomenological pathways."

The thermal flux is usually modeled using Spitzer’s theory, which is based on local Coulomb collisions between the electrons carrying the thermal flux and those in the background. However, often during flares, temperature gradients become sufficiently steep that the collisional mean free path exceeds the temperature gradient scale size, so that thermal conduction becomes inherently non-local. Further, turbulent angular scattering, which is detectable in nonthermal widths of atomic emission lines, can also act to increase the collision frequency and so suppress the heat flux. Recent work by Emslie & Bian (2018) extended Spitzer’s theory of thermal conduction to account for both non-locality and turbulent suppression. We have implemented their theoretical expression for the heat flux (which is a convolution of the Spitzer flux with a kernel function) into the RADYN flare-modeling code and performed a parameter study to understand how the resulting changes in thermal conduction affect flare dynamics and hence the radiation produced. We find that models with reduced heat fluxes predict slower bulk flows, less intense line emission, and longer cooling times. By comparing features of atomic emission lines predicted by the models with Doppler velocities and nonthermal line widths deduced from a particular flare observation, we find that models with suppression factors between 0.3 to 0.5 relative to the Spitzer value best reproduce observed Doppmission lines forming over a wide range of temperatures. Interestingly, the model that best matches observed nonthermal line widths has a kappa-type velocity distribution function."

Focusing our attention on these aspects, we present an analysis of SW compressional fluctuations (f ≈ 1–5 mHz), following two interplanetary shocks observed by two interplanetary spacecraft, regarded as two different situations in terms of spacecraft separation and distance from the magnetosphere. Our results show that some differences in the characteristics of SW fluctuations emerge when the same stream is observed at different places and confirm the critical role of analytical methods in determining fluctuation characteristics. We compared aspects of SW fluctuations with those of magnetospheric fluctuations following the sudden impulses due to the impact of interplanetary shocks. For this scope, we examined observations by two satellites at geostationary orbit and at several ground-based stations. We found that the magnetospheric fluctuations were related to compressional SW fluctuations approximately at the same frequencies, with no evidence for wave activity of internal origin or directly driven by the shock impact."

The equation that expresses the relationship of the PSD parameters between adjacent range bins is derived. By including the attenuation effect within the bin in the discretized equation, the new algorithm alleviates the double-solution problem when attenuation within the bin is sufficiently large. The stability of the solutions to the equation depends on the value of the mean diameter D(sub m) and its gradient with respect to range in the case of liquid precipitation. If the critical diameter above which the dual-frequency ratio (DFR) of radar reflectivity factors becomes a monotonically increasing function of D(sub m), the backward processing of the equation provides a stable or moderately diverging solution, unlike the forward processing that often gives unstable solutions. To provide a set of initial conditions without using the surface reference technique (SRT) in the backward processing, an initialization method using the Hitschfeld-Bordan attenuation correction method is proposed and tested. The proposed algorithm may provide a tool for investigating the assumptions used in various algorithms."

It has also experienced extensive degradation due to development and urban pollution. The Great Rivers Land Trust (GRLT), the National Great Rivers Research & Education Center, Principia College, and the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) Thriving Earth Exchange sought to incorporate inundation and surface water extent layers into their geodatabases to more accurately identify priority areas for wetland restoration. This project aimed to determine the feasibility of detecting inundation extent and duration along the valley using remotely sensed data. We used Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to classify open water and inundated vegetation within the study site. The open water classification was compared to Dynamic Surface Water Extent(DSWE) derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager. We successfully created layers of inundation minimum and maximum extent, as well as inundation duration across the study area for 2019 and 2020. The open water classification resulted in an overall accuracy of 86% when validated against DSWE classifications. These analyses will help end users to identify high priority areas along the LIRV best suited for land conversion projects in the future."

The challenges and solutions described in this document were informed by communications with the UA industry community (e.g., RTCA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and regional air cargo business operators), as well as the PAAV team’s research activities during the last two years including four tabletop exercises, a human-in-the-loop simulation study, a numerical simulation study, a functional allocation study, and flight data analysis (Appendix A). 

This document first describes the expected operational context of PAAV (Section 2), such as the flight mission, baseline UAS components, nominal operations, m:N operations (i.e., ""m"" remote pilots per ""N"" aircraft), and off-nominal operations. This context sets the scope for the PAAV concept development work. PAAV concept development assumes that UA operations will be increasingly autonomous. Thus, near- and far-term assumptions are defined (Section 3). 

PAAV identified seven key challenges for UA operations (Section 4):
 - Flight route planning
 - Separation and flow management
 - Traffic pattern integration
 - Contingency management
 - Taxi, takeoff, and landing
 - m:N operations
 - Communications operations 

The following 13 potential solutions to these challenges are then described (Section 5):

 - Scalable communications architecture
 - Data link
 - Designated UAS corridors
 - Crew planning for m:N operations
 - Flight route optimization
 - Traffic load-level control
 - Trajectory solutions with data link
 - Automated hazard avoidance for m:N operations
 - Traffic pattern integration (TPI) tool
 - Standard lost command and control (C2) link (LC2L) procedures
 - Automated hazard avoidance under LC2L
 - Auto-taxi, auto-takeoff, and auto-land
 - Ground control station (GCS) user interface for m:N operations 

The document attempts to link each of these solutions to one or more of the challenge areas.

Novel solutions involving numerous automation technologies are needed to mitigate traffic and airspace management challenges, especially for realizing m:N operations and ensuring safety under LC2L conditions. The purpose of this document is to help understand alternatives and tradeoffs among potential solutions and provide a foundation for a cohesive PAAV concept that will be described and refined in subsequent concept versions."

The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF–Chem) was employed to simulate O3 production and transportation near the CB. Baseline (water) as well as sensitivity (nowater) model experiments of bay circulation were carried out with and without bay water by changing the water surface from water to land (loam). First, the model performance simulating O3 was evaluated using the baseline experiment results and AirNow surface wind and O3 observations. The results showed that the model overestimates surface O3 by up to 20–30%. Further, the comparisons of the baseline and sensitivity experiments revealed higher O3 mixing ratios, primarily due to the resulting bay breeze circulation. These increases, after considering model overestimation, represent a mean bay dynamics circulation-induced contribution of up to 10% at night and 5% during the day. Furthermore, the boundary layer over northern CB, where it is at its narrowest width, was higher (by 1.2 km on average) during daytime due to higher surface temperatures observed. The boundary layer depth difference between the northern, central, and southern regions of the bay leads to a differential in the role of bay circulation dynamics in the observed O3 increase. The relatively wider swath of water surface over southern CB resulted in a lower boundary layer depth and stronger breeze circulation and this circulation contributed to O3 concentrations. Moreover, since the case selected has a minimal bay breeze circulation, the associated surface ozone enhancements represent what is expected at least at a minimum."

NASA Langley Research Center. The main objective of the test was to develop an AFC system that can provide the necessary lift recovery on a simple-hinged flap high-lift system while minimizing its pneumatic power requirement. Three new types of AFC approaches were examined: Double-Row Sweeping Jets (DRSWJ), Alternating Pulsed Jets (APJ), and High Efficiency Low Power (HELP) actuators. The DRSWJ and the APJ actuators used two rows of unsteady jets, whereas the HELP actuators used an upstream row of sweeping jets combined with a downstream row of steady jets to overcome strong adverse pressure gradients. The test was conducted mostly at a freestream Mach number of 0.20. For exploration purposes, a limited number of runs were made at lower Mach numbers or using vortex generators (VGs). Minimal sensitivity to Mach number or VGs, for the cases evaluated, were observed. The AFC-induced lift coefficient increment was maintained over the AFC-off case for most flow-control cases examined. The CRM-SHL-AFC configuration equipped with HELP actuation was the only actuator configuration able to match or exceed the targeted lift performance of a reference conventional high-lift configuration. The presented aerodynamic data include lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients as a function of angle of attack, with and without the Transonic Wall Interference Correction System (TWICS) method applied. Lift increments as a function of AFC pneumatic power usage (i.e., nozzle pressure ratio, mass flow, momentum coefficient, and power coefficient) are also presented at a lower angle of attack (α = 8.9°) and at maximum lift (α= 17.1°). At the two angles of attack, the surface pressure distributions and autospectral densities from the unsteady pressure transducers for the AFC-off case and the best HELP actuation case are compared."

and configuration-managed approximately 30 risks to astronaut health and performance that
occur before, during and after spaceflight. The Human System Risk Board (HSRB), a Health
and Medical Technical Authority (HMTA) Board at NASA Johnson Space Center, is the entity
responsible for identifying, assessing, analyzing, and monitoring the official understanding of the risk or risk posture for each of the Human System Risks and determining – based on evaluation
of the available evidence – when that risk posture changes. The ultimate purpose of tracking
and researching these risks is to find ways to reduce the risk that astronaut crews face during
spaceflight. Historically, research, development and operations relevant to one risk have been
conducted in isolation from other risks; these individual risk ‘silos’ enabled initial characterization
of each specific risk. In spaceflight however, the impact of exposure to risk for astronaut crews
is cumulative, and not independent of exposures or other risks, as all the adverse effects of the
spaceflight environment begin at launch, continue throughout the duration of the mission and in
some cases across the lifetime of the crews. In January of 2020, the HSRB at NASA embarked
on a pilot project designed to assess the potential value of causal diagramming as a tool to
facilitate understanding of these cumulative and interdependent effects as applied within Human
System Risk management. This process uses directed acyclic graphs as a means of formalizing
a shared mental model of the causal flow of risk among Risk Board stakeholders. Initially this
model was to improve communication among those stakeholders, but the potential value
exceeds communication alone. The causal diagrams are formulated as directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) to function as a type of knowledge graph for reference for the board and its
stakeholders.

This document is a sister document to NASA/TM 20220006812 Directed Acyclic Graph
Guidance Documentation (1). In that document, the basic guidance for creating and
standardizing directed acyclic graphs as tools for cross-risk analysis is provided. This document
contains the initial configuration managed DAGs that were created as a result of applying those
principles. These initial versions were accepted by the HSRB in January of 2022. Each of the
Human System Risks are represented by a DAG that has been reviewed by the larger Human
Health and Performance community at NASA including life scientists, physical scientists,
physicians, nurses, pharmacists, exercise specialists and more. These results show the starting
point for Human System Risk DAGs as shared mental models and communication aids across
the boundaries of the various expertise needed to understand and mitigate the human risks in
spaceflight. Because they are a starting point, each of these DAGs can be expected to change
over time as new or refined evidence becomes available. The process for updating these DAGs
can be found in the JSC-66705 Human System Risk Management Plan (2) that is publicly

For the years 2016 through 2019, we performed an analysis of 550 nm total AOD550, fine mode AOD (FAOD550; also known as FM AOD in the literature), coarse mode AOD (CAOD550), and fine mode fraction (η550) between Moderate Resolution Spectral Imaging Radiometer (MODIS) V6.1 MOD/MYD04 dark target aerosol retrievals and the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP) core four multi-model consensus (C4C) of analyses/short term forecasts that assimilate total MODIS AOD550. Differences were adjudicated by the global shipboard Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) and selected island AERONET sun photometer observations with the application of the spectral deconvolution algorithm (SDA). Through a series of conditional and regional analyses, we found divergence included regions of terrestrial influence and latitudinal dependencies in the remote oceans. Notably, MODIS and the C4C and its members, while having good correlations overall, have a persistent +0.04 to +0.02 biases relative to MAN and AERONET for typical AOD550 values (84th% < 0.28), with the C4C underestimating significant events thereafter. Second, high biases in AOD550 are largely associated with the attribution of the fine mode in satellites and models alike. Thus, both MODIS and C4C members are systematically overestimating AOD550 and FAOD550 but perform better in characterizing the CAOD550. Third, for MODIS, findings are consistent with previous reports of a high bias in the retrieved Ångström Exponent, and we diagnosed both the optical model and cloud masking as likely causal factors for the AOD550 and FAOD550 high bias, whereas for the C4C, it is likely from secondary overproduction and perhaps numerical diffusion. Fourth, while there is no wind-speed-dependent bias for surface winds <12 m s−1, the C4C and MODIS AOD550s also overestimate CAOD550 and FAOD550, respectively, for wind speeds above 12 m/s. Finally, sampling bias inherent in MAN, as well as other circumstantial evidence, suggests biases in MODIS are likely MODIS and the C4C products have their own strengths and challenges for a given climate application and discuss needed research. even larger than what was diagnosed here.

Here, we elucidate key facets of gas-phase photochemistry and assess novel chemical processes via a case study of the 2013 California Rim Fire plume. Airborne in situ observations, acquired during the NASA Studies of Emissions, Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS) mission, illustrate the evolution of volatile organic compounds (VOC), oxidants, and reactive nitrogen over 12 hours of atmospheric aging. Measurements show rapid formation of ozone and peroxyacyl nitrates (PNs), sustained peroxide production, and prolonged enhancements in oxygenated VOC and nitrogen oxides (NOX). Measurements and Lagrangian trajectories constrain a 0-D puff model that approximates plume photochemical history and provides a framework for evaluating key processes. Simulations examine the effects of 1) previously-unmeasured reactive VOC identified in recent laboratory studies, and 2) emissions and secondary production of nitrous acid (HONO). Inclusion of estimated unmeasured VOC leads to a 250% increase in OH reactivity and a 70% increase in radical production via oxygenated VOC photolysis. HONO amplifies radical cycling and serves as a downwind NOX source, although two different HONO production mechanisms (particulate nitrate photolysis and heterogeneous NO2 conversion) exhibit markedly different effects on ozone, NOX, and PNs. Analysis of radical initiation rates suggests that oxygenated VOC photolysis is a major radical source, exceeding HONO photolysis when averaged over the first 2 hours of aging. Ozone production chemistry transitions from VOC-sensitive to NOX-sensitive within the first hour of plume aging, with both peroxide and organic nitrate formation contributing significantly to radical termination. To simulate smoke plume chemistry accurately, models should simultaneously account for the full reactive VOC pool and all relevant oxidant sources."

While the dawn-dusk (By) component of the IMF is also known to play an important role, its effects are usually assumed to be independent of its sign. Here we demonstrate for the first time a seasonally varying, explicit IMF By-dependence of the ring current and Dst index. Using satellite observations and a global magnetohydrodynamic model coupled with a ring current model, we show that for a fixed level of solar wind driving the flux of energetic magnetospheric protons and the growth-rate of the ring current are greater for By < 0 (By > 0) than for By > 0 (By < 0) in Northern Hemisphere
summer (winter). While the physical mechanism of this explicit By-effect is not yet fully understood, our results suggest that IMF By modulates magnetospheric convection and plasma transport in the inner magnetosphere."

The data were measured during CASSINI’s swing-by maneuver at the Earth on 18 August 1999 and are published by Werner et al. (2004). In this study the dayside HDAC Lyman-α observations published by Werner et al. (2004) are compared to calculated Lyman-α intensities based on the 3D H-density model derived from TWINS (Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers) Lyman-α observations between 2008–2010 (Zoennchen et al., 2015). It was found that both Lyman-α profiles show a very similar radial dependence in particular between 3–8RE. Between 3.0–5.5RE impact distance Lyman-α observations of both TWINS and UVIS/HDAC exist at the ecliptic dayside. In this overlapping region the cross-calibration of the HDAC profile against the calculated TWINS profile was done, assuming that the exosphere there was similar for both due to comparable space weather conditions. As a result of the cross-calibration the conversion factor between counts per second and rayleigh, fc = 3.285 counts s−1R−1, is determined for these HDAC observations. Using this factor, the radial H-density profile for the Earth’s ecliptic dayside was derived from the UVIS/HDAC observations, which constrained the neutral H density there at 10RE to a value of 35 cm-3. Furthermore, a faster radial H-density decrease was found at distances above  8RE (≈r−2.37) compared to the lower distances of 3–7RE (≈r−2.37). This increased loss of neutral H above 8RE might indicate a higher rate of H ionization in the vicinity of the magnetopause at 9–11RE (near subsolar point) and beyond, because of increasing charge exchange interactions of exospheric H atoms with solar wind ions outside the magnetosphere."

In about half of the events, the wave vector has a small component along the current sheet normal, consistent with known lower-hybrid drift wave properties, but the perpendicular magnetic field fluctuations can be comparable or greater than the parallel component, a feature unique to the waves inside and adjacent to EDRs. Another new wave property is that the wave vector has a significant component along the current sheet normal in some events and completely along the normal for one event. In 1/4of the events, the ∇∙𝑷(sub 𝑒) term has a significant contribution to the wave electric field, possibly a feature of lower-hybrid waves more likely to exist in the diffusion region than further away from the X-line. Electron temperature variations are correlated with the wave potential, due to wave electric field acceleration and crossings at the corrugated separatrix region with different amounts of mixing between reconnection inflowing and outflowing populations. The latter also leads to the anti-correlation between parallel and perpendicular temperature components. Using four-spacecraft measurements, the magnetic field line twisting is demonstrated by the correlated fluctuations in (∇×𝑽(sub 𝐸×𝐵))||and (∇×𝐁)||. The lower-hybrid wave in the EDR of weak guide field reconnection may be generated near separatrices and penetrate to the mid-plane or locally generated, and the latter possibility is beyond the prediction of previous reconnection simulations."

These changes in chemistry can help tailor PAW for different space applications. An AC, DC, and nanosecond (ns) pulsed power supply were each used to generate PAW with stainless steel, copper, tungsten, or platinum (Pt) electrodes while utilizing air, nitrogen (N2), carbon dioxide (CO2), helium (He), or argon (Ar) as the feed gas. Tap or deionized (DI) water was treated for 1 to 15 minutes, and the generated PAW was tested for changes in pH, conductivity, oxidation reduction potential, nitrates (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and peroxide. Calculations showed that the production of reactive nitrogen species was the leading cause of pH and conductivity changes. The DC generated air plasma was able to reduce the pH of DI water and generate NO3‑. The pulsed supply, operating at 20% of the input power of the DC supply, lowered the pH generated NO3‑. When a simulated Martian gas mixture of 95% CO2 and 5% N2 was used as the feed gas, NO3‑ was generated with the DC and pulsed supplies, respectively. Mixing PAW with plasma generated ash from inedible biomass allowed pH control, thus enhancing PAW’s potential use for sanitation applications. The large shift in pH was used to study sanitation effects of Escherichia coli (E. coli) reduction and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), in which log reductions were found to be negligible. Additionally, the plasma generated ash in combination with PAW was also implemented in 10-day microgreen growth trials, in which PAW and ash resulted in quicker emergence of the microgreens compared to the standard growth conditions and comparable dry masses to Hoagland’s nutrient solution treated samples."

Many ocean color algorithms use a few selected spectral bands to perform an atmospheric correction and then derive the upwelling radiance from the ocean. The limitations in the atmospheric correction under certain conditions lead to many gaps in daily spatial coverage of ocean color retrievals. To address these limitations, we introduce a new approach that uses machine learning to estimate ocean color from top of atmosphere radiances or reflectance measurements. In this approach, a principal component analysis is used to decompose the hyperspectral measurements into spectral features that describe the scattering and absorption of the atmosphere and the underlying surface. The coefficients of the principal components are then used to train a neural network to predict ocean color properties derived from the MODIS atmospheric correction algorithm. This machine learning approach is independent of a priori information and does not rely on any radiative transfer modeling. We apply the approach to two hyperspectral UV/VIS instruments, the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), using measurements from 320–500 nm to show that it can be used to reproduce ocean color properties in less-than-ideal conditions. This machine learning approach complements the current atmospheric correction ocean color retrievals by filling in the gaps resulting from cloud, aerosol, and sunglint contamination. This method can be applied to the future hyperspectral Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), which will be onboard NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) ocean color satellite set to launch in 2024."

Phase I captured NASA Centers’ current practices for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical (EEE) parts 1 used in spaceflight systems and ground support equipment (available at
https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20205011579) [ref. 1]. The Phase II report provides guidance for selecting and using COTS parts in NASA missions. The approaches proposed in this report differ from current agency practices. This top-level executive summary touches on these new approaches for using COTS parts but does not provide the detailed information that is critical in understanding the rationale behind these new approaches. Readers will need to read the entire report to gain full understanding and effectively use the recommendations herein. 

NASA’s historical approach to selecting and applying parts has been to define certain parts, primarily specific classes of military specification (MIL-SPEC) parts, as “standard”, leaving all others, including COTS parts, as nonstandard. Standard parts typically are used without further testing (“use-as-is”). Nonstandard parts are subjected to initial screening and subsequent lot acceptance testing of representative samples from each procured lot per MIL-SPEC or similar requirements.

Decades later, top-tier commercial part manufacturers have evolved significant manufacturing, statistical control, and technological improvements that can now provide parts as reliable or more reliable than MIL-SPEC parts, when used within their datasheet limits. Concurrently, the space science and exploration community’s needs demand technological advances unavailable with MIL-SPEC parts. This ongoing change necessitates using COTS parts for space missions. Properly selected COTS parts in appropriate applications can offer performance and supply availability advantages compared to MIL-SPEC parts. Their utility and demonstrated reliability result from large volumes and automated production and testing processes. However, careful review and a thorough understanding of their specifications (i.e., datasheet limitations) is needed, and verifying that manufacturer specifications and reliability meet space hardware application needs are necessary.

This report recommends MIL-SPEC screening and non-radiation-related lot acceptance testing be reduced or eliminated in cases where evidence of sufficient quality and reliability exists for COTS parts. The extent of NASA's insight into COTS manufacturers and the amount and nature of the needed evidence will differ by mission and will likely be driven by a mission's resources and associated risk posture.

To facilitate this goal, two new terminologies have been defined and described: “Industry Leading Parts Manufacturer (ILPM)” and “Established COTS parts.” An ILPM is a COTS manufacturer that produces high quality and reliable parts. Some parts produced by ILPMs, defined as Established COTS parts, do not need any additional MIL-SPEC or NASA screening and lot acceptance testing to be used in space applications.

This report provides guidance for selecting, procuring, and applying COTS parts and for performing part-, board-, and system-level COTS parts verification. The recommendation to select Established COTS parts from ILPMs will assure those COTS parts will have comparable quality to corresponding MIL-SPEC parts. Selecting, applying, and verifying Established COTS parts from ILPMs requires a holistic team approach, engaging parts engineers, circuit designers, quality, reliability, and systems engineers, procurement specialists, radiation specialists, avionics leads, and program/project managers. A mission-specific approach tailored to a project’s Mission, Environment, Applications and Lifetime (MEAL) [ref. 2] requirements should be developed and approved by program/project managers. Any associated risks should be clearly identified, quantified, mitigated, and/or accepted.

Different approaches are recommended according to program/project Risk Classes A, B, C, and D [ref. 3] and human-rated missions [ref. 4]:
1. Recommend Classes A and B and human-rated missions consider a “MIL-SPEC parts- based design” approach. ”MIL-SPEC parts-based design” approach is one in which most parts are MIL-SPEC parts and Established COTS parts from ILPMs are used only when
an equivalent MIL-SPEC part does not meet functional or size, weight, and power (SWaP) or performance requirements, or is not available.
2. Recommend Classes D and Sub-D missions consider a “System of COTS” approach. “System of COTS” approach is one which most parts are Established COTS parts from ILPMs.
3. Recommend Class C missions determine which approach is the best for their projects; that is, use either a “MIL-SPEC parts-based design” approach, “System of COTS” approach, or a combined approach utilizing elements of both.

This report intends to provide guidance in using COTS parts for NASA missions with risk classifications of A through D and human-rated missions; but it does not address the costs of using COTS parts. Costs of using COTS parts in different NASA mission classes can vary significantly even if the same parts are used in different risk postures, due to differing verification levels needed. The guidance does not distinguish between critical or non-critical systems, and a given project will need to apply the appropriate guidance based on their risk posture.

The intended audience of this report are NASA personnel and commercial practitioners who support NASA’s spaceflight missions, including spaceflight program or project managers, parts engineers, parts manufacturers, radiation engineers, avionics engineers, system engineers, circuit design engineers, reliability engineers, safety and mission assurance (SMA) personnel, and parts procurement specialists.

The NEPP Program will perform a pathfinder study to explore implementing the guidance in this NESC report. An ILPM verification process is not the same as conventional vendor qualification processes performed according to military standards and specifications. This NESC report intends to provide guidance in utilizing available parts data from ILPM manufacturers for parts assurance assessments needed for NASA missions.

The report also captured the current practices from DoD and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Section 10. Note each DoD and FAA report was provided by the corresponding agencies regarding their practices, which are independent from the NESC recommendations in the report."

By gathering direct measurements of the coupling of ion and neutral gases in this region, ASTRE provides the critical missing link in our knowledge of the transfer, dissipation, and regulation of energy and momentum between the sun and the upper atmosphere. ASTRE provides the first detailed, systematic investigation of this important unexplored region, vastly improves and constrains models of the upper atmosphere, and fills a critical gap in our understanding of how the coupled lower ionosphere/upper atmosphere “works” as a system. 

To achieve its science objectives, ASTRE gathers accurate measurements of plasma and neutral gases, electric and magnetic fields, and energetic particles using well-proven, in situ instruments with excellent flight heritage. Furthermore, as described herein, all the instruments have been designed to perform well in the low perigee environment, including altitudes of 150 km and lower. 

ASTRE utilizes a three-axis stabilized satellite that uses on-board propulsion to carry out systematic, low perigee measurements at high latitudes. The satellite design incorporates a “form follows function” approach with a cylindrical shape and conductive body-mounted solar arrays to minimize drag and perturbations to the space environment. Atomic-oxygen resistant materials are utilized and a passive thermal design with heat pipes and radiator panels minimizes the impact of aero-heating. 

ASTRE launches into a 250 km × 1500 km elliptical insertion orbit with an inclination of 83°. Perigee precesses from its highest northern latitude to its highest southern latitude every ~60 days. Hydrazine propulsion provides over 2000 orbits with perigee below 200 km, with a significant fraction as low as 150 km, during high latitude, two-week campaigns when perigee precesses to either the northern or southern high latitude region. At mid and low latitudes, the perigee is near 225 km. Because very conservative assumptions were made with respect to the orbital analysis and drag, including continuous 3-sigma “worst-case” solar flux and atmospheric density, when additional propellant is included (accommodated in the current design) and some of the stringent assumptions are relaxed, the ASTRE mission described herein may be expected to include repeated excursions to altitudes of ~130 km or even lower. 

This paper presents an overview of the ASTRE mission, its science motivation, and objectives. It includes a discussion of the science-driven requirements and traceability, followed by a “proof-of concept” implementation that includes notional instruments and a straightforward spacecraft design. Three key points are demonstrated: 1) There is a critical knowledge gap in the high latitude, atmosphere-space transition region below 250 km; 2) The instrument and measurement techniques needed to obtain the ASTRE measurements are well-proven and function well in the low-altitude environment; and 3) A mature spacecraft design, flight dynamics analysis, and concept of operations have been developed that demonstrate that the ASTRE mission can be achieved in a straightforward manner using current technologies."

Many have explored methods of estimating the total leakage inductance of transformers as an integrated series inductance without external inductors. However, this poses challenges with medium frequency converters and magnetic ribbon-based cores, e.g., metal amorphous nanocrystalline. The material’s relatively high conductivity allows eddy currents to develop when magnetic flux intersects wide surfaces. These eddy currents result in significant additional losses that increase with increasing power flow. This paper presents a simplified and accurate method of estimating leakage flux while identifying separate leakage flux paths that correlate with the magnetic material surfaces. This enables an understanding the proportion of leakage flux that will contribute to extra losses. The methods presented are applicable to both leakage and fringing (around heterogeneous material interfaces) fluxes. This paper includes detailed FEA studies and 3D flux vector measurements matching the presented analytical models."

Drought in Arizona has been persistent for many decades, yet in 2021 PJW experienced a mass tree mortality event at the Wupatki National Monument (WNM) and in other areas across the American Southwest. Previously, researchers at the National Park Service (NPS) and the team from the NASA DEVELOP National Program attempted to quantify the extent of mortality in Northern Arizona between 2015 and 2021 using high resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial photographs. This project aimed to improve the previous term’s methodology and expanded the comparison of the post-mortality event in 2021 to include tree cover assessments for 2017 and 2019. In this iteration, the team utilized NAIP imagery in conjunction with Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) to calculate the total difference in PJW mortality using an unsupervised classification model trained from multi-date Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) and the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) data for the study area. The research also assessed correlations between tree mortality and environmental factors using Western Land Data Assimilation System (WLDAS) modelled climate data. Average PJW mortality from 2015 to 2021 was 21.63% including 19.8% in WNM with the vast majority of dieback occurring between 2019 and 2021. The correlations were weak with the most correlated variables being bare soil evaporation (0.15), rainfall (0.14), groundwater storage (0.13), and wind speed (0.12), perhaps indicating drought as a likely driver of PJW mortality."

Here we present global emission estimates from this framework for the period 1999–2016. We assimilate a newly constructed, multi-agency database of CH4 and δC-13 measurements. We find that traditional CH4-only atmospheric inversions are unlikely to estimate emissions consistent with atmospheric δC-13 data and assimilating δC-13 data is necessary to derive emissions consistent with both measurements. Our framework attributes ca. 85% of the post-2007 growth in atmospheric methane to microbial sources, with about half of that coming from the tropics between 23.5° N and 23.5° S. This contradicts the attribution of the recent growth in the methane budget of the Global Carbon Project (GCP). We find that the GCP attribution is only consistent with our top-down estimate in the absence of δC-13 data. We find that at global and continental scales, δC-13 data can separate microbial from fossil methane emissions much better than CH4 data alone, and at smaller scales this ability is limited by the current δC-13 measurement coverage. Finally, we find that the largest uncertainty in using δC-13 data to separate different methane source types comes from our knowledge of atmospheric chemistry, specifically the distribution of tropospheric chlorine and the isotopic discrimination of the methane sink."

These algorithms have been applied to Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA); radar track data (e.g., Threaded Track); and safety reports, including Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) and Aviation Safety Action Plan (ASAP). SWS is working with partners to get access to other data that air carriers provide, such as maintenance data, and has been assisting carriers in working with other data, such as Line Operations Safety Audit (LOSA) data, using manual methods. However, the project has discussed whether there are other data that are not traditionally used in aviation safety analysis that may be useful. This paper discusses four sets of data and models that are not traditionally used in aviation safety but that have shown promise for such use. In the future, we plan to incorporate such data into ML algorithms to use with data that we have used before and determine the additional benefit that is actually achieved under different contexts from the inclusion of these non-traditional data sources."

Similar prelaunch tests and identical on-orbit calibration algorithms established the foundation for their consistent Earth measurements. Calibration assessment and consistency comparisons are useful to maintain their performance and measurement   accuracy. Simultaneous   nadir   overpasses (SNO) between   two   satellites   are commonly used for a direct calibration comparison between sensors. However, there are no SNO between SNPP and NOAA20. Hence, a reference sensor or Earth measurements are normally used to bridge the comparison. As a reference, we focus on the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the GOES-R series spacecraft and its application to the SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS comparison. GOES16 and GOES17are the first two satellites of the GOES-R series and were launched on November 19, 2016, and March 12, 2018, respectively. Their operational positions are on the equator with longitudes of 75.2° West over land and 137.2° West over ocean, respectively. The ABI is the primary imaging instrument of these spacecrafts for the Earth’s weather, oceans, and environment, with observations (every 10 minutes) that provide vast data for GEO-Low Earth orbit (LEO)and LEO-LEO comparisons utilizing it as an intermediate reference sensor.  VIIRS and ABI have spectrally matched bands and can have simultaneous measurements over any selected site every day. The simultaneous measurements over the same site also have various scan angles. These features provide advantages for a VIIRS-to-ABI comparison. The spectral response function difference between instruments, sites selected, and view angles will have effects on the instrument measurements.  Their impacts on the calibration comparison, including the use of double differences, will be discussed.  By collecting VIIRS measurements over a large range of view angles, the view angle effect will also be investigated. The collection of an ample amount of data provides an advantage for statistical analyses and potential big data applications to sensor calibration assessments. This method can also be applied to other sensor calibration comparison and performance assessments, such as GOES16 and GOES17 ABI, and Terra and Aqua MODIS."

Design concepts and diagnostics of a hypervelocity flow generator (HFG) were made as a test platform for hypersonic/hypervelocity spacecraft models at the NASA Langley Research Center. The HFG is a hypersonic flow field generator using optically heated gas which is blown into an 80 cu m vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is kept at a stable vacuum pressure with a combination of three large vacuum pumps, while the HFG is in the test mode. The HFG provides a relatively small test section with approximately a 20 cm window. This facility was designed to generate 2.45 km/sec of flow speed, and potentially generate a continuous flow with the nozzle and vacuum system. The window in test section provides a direct view of the shock wave around a model in order to measure temperature, pressure, and density profile within the shock layer. One of the key test goals under this project is to understand why the emission spectra from the standing shockwave plasma predicted by Lora-Loran codes are significantly different from the measured emission spectra from the Flight Investigation Reentry Environment (FIRE II) Flight. The correct estimate of the thermal loading on the leading edge of hypersonic vehicles greatly affects the aerodynamic design, the material selection for the vehicle, and the cooling requirement and can be obtained by the precise modeling of emission spectra from shockwave plasma. However, the estimation of thermal loading is not an easy task due to complex non-equilibrium radiative process within high temperature shock layers that still falls into a category of cold plasma. Direct flight experiments are the most desirable, but not a cost-effective approach. Analysis by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) offers many test flexibilities. However, the CFD codes must be fully tested and validated with experimental data before the codes are effectively used for practical design. Large discrepancies between experiments and codes appear in hypersonic/hypervelocity flow regimes at high altitudes of 60 km ~ 90 km. This HFG facility offers some important parameters for CFD code validation, such as collision cross-sections, relaxation times, reaction rate coefficients and transportation coefficients. The HFG test facility is based on the ejection flow of high temperature gas heated over to 3500 K through a nozzle. The tungsten gas chamber of the HFG is heated up to a desired temperature by a 60 kW optical power beam source. This system consists of an optical power source, a thermal chamber, an expansion nozzle, a test section, and an 80 cu m vacuum tank. 60 kW optical input power is obtained from the 150 kW Vortek arc lamp system (by Vortek Industries, Vancouver, Canada). This optical beam is focused to heat the gas chamber within which a flow media is heated. The maximum achievable temperature of the flow medium reached approximately 3500 K or even higher but is limited by the melting point of the chamber material used. The exhaust velocity through the nozzle was determined by the stagnation temperature and the molecular weight of the working medium at the test section. To provide design parameters, a NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Application (CEA) computer program is used for the simulation of aerothermal data. This CEA program can calculate chemical equilibrium and properties of complex mixtures using shock tube parameters. For nitrogen gas at 2666 K stagnation temperature, the maximum achievable velocity at the test section is approximately 2.45 km/sec which is within the range of the thermal velocity of 8000 K shock layer. Based on the calculation through the CEA program, the design parameters of a HFG were determined and implemented for the test section that includes an expansion nozzle. The installed test section of the experimental facility can sustain a condition of a re-entry vehicle from the Space at an altitude of 60-90 km. After installation of the HFG, the system was fully tested and its operational parameters were measured. An 80 cu m vacuum chamber of HFG was set at 1 torr level to keep a stable downstream condition. The pumping time to reach the minimum vacuum pressure (~ 1 torr) at the test chamber from atmospheric pressure was approximately an hour using Kinney (MBV-14000/MB -1600/KT-300) and Stokes (Model 1772 and 412) pumps. Such a setup condition allowed a continued stable operation of the HFG experiment with flowrates through 1-, 3-, or 5-mm diameters of nozzle throat. The flow characteristics of the HFG for various operating conditions were performed using a focused Schlieren method. At 0.8 torr chamber pressure, a barrel shock was observed at the test section. With a sphere obstacle of 12 mm diameter in the flow, a bow shock (~ 2-mm thickness) was observed by a focused Schlieren visualization method."

We show that tropical middle atmospheric water vapor simulated with the specified-dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM) is consistent with changes observed in a merged satellite data set, which encompasses the period 1993–2020. Consistent with previous work, we find no significant trend in the stratosphere in either the observations or the simulation; in the mesosphere, we find a long-term trend of 0.1 ppmv per decade, but only in the observations. We also analyze an SD-WACCM simulation for the longer period 1980–2019 to quantify the contribution of various factors to the decadal variation of middle atmospheric water vapor. Over 1980–1995, the simulated water vapor in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, averaged zonally and over ±30° latitude, increases by 0.30 ppmv per decade due to increasing methane emissions. After 1995, a significant abrupt decrease of water vapor of 0.37 ppmv per decade and then a gradual increase of 0.33 ppmv per decade result from changes in stratospheric cold point temperature. The cold-point temperature is strongly influenced by the strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation. The acceleration of the Brewer-Dobson circulation before about 2003 leads to a cooler tropical tropopause and a decrease of water vapor, and the deceleration thereafter leads to corresponding warming of the tropopause and an increase in water vapor."

Together, the data indicate ion upflow in the vicinity of pulsating aurora. Additionally, the data show a strong 630.0 nm (red-line) auroral emission. Observations of pulsating aurora are typically reported at 557.7 and 427.8 nm, as these wavelengths are more sensitive to high-energy (∼ tens of keV) electron precipitation. In contrast, 630.0 nm emission is generated preferentially by low-energy soft electron precipitation (∼ hundreds of eV), and is less commonly observed. The All-Sky Imager data discussed here are unusual in that they suggest regions of enhanced soft electron precipitation in conjunction with enhanced ambipolar electric fields, which are a known factor contributing to ion outflow."

MOSES is a slitless spectrograph that forms images in multiple spectral orders simultaneously using a concave diffraction grating in an effort to measure line profiles over a wide field of view from a single exposure. Early work on MOSES data showed evidence of solar features composed of neither He ii 303.8 Å nor the nearby Si xi 303.3 Å spectral lines. We have built a forward model that uses cotemporal EIT images and the Chianti atomic database to fit synthetic images with known spectra to the MOSES data in order to quantify this additional spectral content. Our fit reveals a host of dim lines that alone are insignificant but combined contribute a comparable intensity to MOSES images as Si xi 303.3 Å. In total, lines other than He ii 303.8 Å and Si xi 303.3 Å contribute approximately 10% of the total intensity in the MOSES zero order image. This additional content, if not properly accounted for, could significantly impact the analysis of MOSES and similar slitless spectrograph data, especially those using a zero-order (undispersed) image. More broadly, this serves as a reminder that multilayer EUV imagers are sensitive to a host of weak contaminant lines."

It is understood that implementations may be limited by the quantity of available data and by the lack of turbulence symmetry. Assessment of the accuracy and feasibility of such third-order (or Yaglom) relations is most effectively accomplished by examining the von Kármán–Howarth equation in increment form, a framework from which the third-order laws are derived as asymptotic approximations. Using this approach, we examine the context of third-order laws for incompressible MHD in some detail. The simplest versions rely on the assumption of isotropy and the presence of a well-defined inertial range, while related procedures generalize the same idea to arbitrary rotational symmetries. Conditions for obtaining correct and accurate values of the dissipation rate from these laws based on several sampling and fitting strategies are investigated using results from simulations. The questions we address are of particular relevance to sampling of solar wind turbulence by one or more spacecraft."

Essential to advancing our knowledge of solar wind and energetic particle formation is identifying the sources of PSP observations. We report on results for the first two PSP solar encounters derived using the Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) model driven by Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) model maps. We derive the coronal magnetic field and the 1 R⊙ source regions of the PSP-observed solar wind. We validate our results with the solar wind speed and magnetic polarity observed at PSP. When modeling results are very reliable, we derive time series of model-derived spacecraft separation from the heliospheric current sheet, magnetic expansion factor, coronal hole boundary distance, and photospheric field strength along the field lines estimated to be connected to the spacecraft. We present new results for Encounter 1, which show time evolution of the far-side mid-latitude coronal hole that PSP corotates with. We discuss how this evolution coincides with solar wind speed, density, and temperature observed at the spacecraft. During Encounter 2, a new active region emerges on the solar far side, making it difficult to model. We show that ADAPT-WSA output agrees well with PSP observations once this active region rotates onto the near side, allowing us to reliably estimate the solar wind sources retrospectively for most of the encounter. We close with ways in which coronal modeling enables scientific interpretation of these encounters that would otherwise not have been possible."

Assessing their accuracy is a complex task, and there are multiple observational pathways to provide constraints and tune model parameters. Here, we combine several such independent constraints, defining a model-agnostic framework for standardized comparison. We require models to predict the distribution of coronal holes at the photosphere, and neutral line topology at the model's outer boundary. We compare these predictions to extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations of coronal hole locations, white-light Carrington maps of the streamer belt, and the magnetic sector structure measured in situ by Parker Solar Probe and 1 au spacecraft. We study these metrics for potential field source surface (PFSS) models as a function of source surface height and magnetogram choice, as well as comparing to the more physical Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) and the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) models. We find that simultaneous optimization of PFSS models to all three metrics is not currently possible, implying a trade-off between the quality of representation of coronal holes and streamer belt topology. WSA and MAS results show the additional physics that they include address this by flattening the streamer belt while maintaining coronal hole sizes, with MAS also improving coronal hole representation relative to WSA. We conclude that this framework is highly useful for inter- and intra-model comparisons. Integral to the framework is the standardization of observables required of each model, evaluating different model aspects."

Global magnetic maps, generated by the Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric flux Transport (ADAPT) model, are modified to enforce field unipolarity thresholds both within and outside observed CH boundaries. The polar modified and unmodified maps are used to drive Wang–Sheeley–Arge (WSA) models of the corona and solar wind (SW). The WSA-predicted CHs are compared with the observations, and SW predictions at the WIND and Ulysses spacecraft are also used to provide context for the new polar modified maps. We find that modifications of the polar flux never worsen and typically improve both the CH and SW predictions. We also confirm the importance of the choice of the domain over which WSA generates the coronal magnetic field solution but find that solutions optimized for one location in the heliosphere can worsen predictions at other locations. Finally, we investigate the importance of low-latitude (i.e., active region) magnetic fields in setting the boundary of polar CHs, determining that they have at least as much impact as the polar fields themselves."

We analyse the properties of these oscillations using wavelet tools (e.g. power, cross-power, coherence, and phase difference) along with the stringent noise model (i.e. power law + constant). We estimate the period of the intensity and Doppler velocity oscillations at each chosen location in the QS and quantify the distribution of the statistically significant power and associated periods in one bright region and two dark regions. In the bright TR region, the mean periods in intensity and velocity are 7 min and 8 min, respectively. In the dark regions, the mean periods in intensity and velocity are 7 min and 5.4 min, respectively. We also estimate the phase difference between the intensity and Doppler velocity oscillations at each location. The statistical distribution of the phase difference is estimated, which peaks at −119° ± 13°, 33° ± 10°, 102° ± 10° in the bright region and at −153° ± 13°, 6° ± 20°, 151° ± 10° in the dark regions. The statistical distribution reveals that the oscillations are caused by propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves encountered with the TR. Some of these locations may also be associated with standing slow waves. Moreover, in the given time domain, several locations exhibit the presence of both propagating and standing oscillations at different frequencies."

We present a sample of 6003 stars with ages 7–25 Myr in 10 nearby open clusters from Chandra X-ray and Gaia-EDR3 surveys. Combined with previous results in large samples of younger (≲5 Myr) stars in MYStIX and SFiNCs star-forming regions, mass-stratified activity-age relations are derived for the early phases of stellar evolution. X-ray luminosity (LX) is constant during the first few Myr, possibly due to the presence of extended X-ray coronas insensitive to temporal changes in stellar size. LX then decays during the 7–25 Myr period, more rapidly as stellar mass increases. This decay is interpreted as decreasing efficiency of the α2 dynamo as radiative cores grow and a solar-type αΩ dynamo emerges. For more massive 3.5–7 M⊙ fully radiative stars, the X-ray emission plummets—indicating the lack of an effective magnetic dynamo. The findings provide improved measurements of high-energy radiation effects on circumstellar material, first for the protoplanetary disk and then for the atmospheres of young planets. The observed X-ray luminosities can be so high that an inner Earth-mass rocky, unmagnetized planet around a solar-mass PMS star might lose its primary and secondary atmospheres within a few (several) million years. PMS X-ray emission may thus have a significant impact on the evolution of early-planetary atmospheres and the conditions promoting the rise of habitability."

We report multiscale ALMA observations of the N159W-North clump, which is the most CO-intense region in the galaxy. High-resolution CO isotope and 1.3 mm continuum observations with an angularresolution of∼025(∼0.07 pc)revealed more thanfive protostellar sources with CO outflows within the mainridge clump. One of the thermal continuum sources, MMS-2, shows an especially massive/dense nature whosetotal H2mass and peak column density are∼104Meand∼1024cm−2, respectively, and harbors massive(∼100Me)starless core candidates identified as its internal substructures. The main ridge containing this sourcecan be categorized as one of the most massive protocluster systems in the Local Group. The CO high-resolutionobservations found several distinctfilamentary clouds extending southward from the star-forming spots. The CO(1–0)data set with a largerfield of view reveals a conical,∼30 pc long complex extending toward the northerndirection. These features indicate that a large-scale gas compression event may have produced the massive star-forming complex. Based on the striking similarity between the N159W-North complex and the other twopreviously reported high-mass star-forming clouds in the nearby regions, we propose a“teardrops inflow model”that explains the synchronized, extreme star formation across>50 pc, including one of the most massiveprotocluster clumps in the Local Group."

The HDO 211–212 line has been detected toward hot cores N 105–2 A and 2 B in the N 105 star-forming region in the low-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) dwarf galaxy with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We have compared the HDO line luminosity (LHDO) measured toward the LMC hot cores to those observed toward a sample of 17 Galactic hot cores covering three orders of magnitude in LHDO, four orders of magnitude in bolometric luminosity (Lbol), and a wide range of Galactocentric distances (thus metallicities). The observed values of LHDO for the LMC hot cores fit very well into the LHDO trends with Lbol and metallicity observed toward the
Galactic hot cores. We have found that LHDO seems to be largely dependent on the source luminosity, but metallicity also plays a role. We provide a rough estimate of the H2O column density and abundance ranges toward the LMC hot cores by assuming that HDO/H2O toward the LMC hot cores is the same as that observed in the Milky Way; the estimated ranges are systematically lower than Galactic values. The spatial distribution and velocity structure of the HDO emission in N 105–2 A is consistent with HDO being the product of the low temperature dust grain chemistry. Our results are in agreement with the astrochemical model predictions that HDO is abundant regardless of the extragalactic environment and should be detectable with ALMA in external galaxies."

SAM evolved H2O data indicated that the primary phyllosilicate in all GT samples was an Fe-rich dioctahedral smectite (e.g., nontronite) with lesser amounts of a phyllosilicate such as mixed layer talc-serpentine or greenalite-minnesotaite. CO(2) data supported the identification of siderite in several samples, and CO(2) and CO data was also consistent with trace oxidized organic compounds such as oxalate salts. SO(2) data indicated trace and/or amorphous Fe sulfates in all samples and one sample may contain Fe sulfides. SO(2) data points to significant Mg sulfates in two samples, and lesser amounts in several other samples. A lack of evolved O(2) indicated the absence of oxychlorine salts and Mn3+/Mn4+ oxides. The lack of, or very minor, evolved NO revealed absent or very trace nitrate/nitrite salts. HCl data suggested chloride salts in GT samples. Constraints from EGA data on mineralogy and chemistry indicated that the environmental history of GT involved alteration with fluids of variable redox potential, chemistry and pH under a range of fluid-to-rock ratio conditions. Several of the fluid episodes could have provided habitable environmental conditions and carbon would have been available to any past microbes though the lack of significant N could have been a limiting factor for microbial habitability in the GT region."

PACE’s global hyperspectral imaging radiometer design concept will enable new discoveries in Earth’s living ocean (Figure 2), such as the diversity of organisms fueling marine food webs and how aquatic ecosystems respond to environmental change. Its instrument payload (Figure 3) will also observe Earth’s atmosphere to study clouds, airborne aerosol particles, and the interactions between the two. Looking at the ocean, clouds, and aerosols together will improve our knowledge of the roles each plays in our evolving planet. Other applications of PACE science data records—from identifying the frequency, extent, and duration of aquatic harmful algal blooms to improving our understanding of air quality—will result in direct economic, recreational, and societal benefits.

The data come from fourteen DORIS satellites: TOPEX/Poseidon, SPOT-2, SPOT-3, SPOT-4, SPOT-5, Envisat, Jason-1, Jason-2, Cryosat-2, Saral, HY-2A, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B. In their processing, the four analysis centers which contributed to the DORIS combined solution used the latest time variable gravity models, the new mean pole and diurnal-subdiurnal tidal EOP models recommended by IERS. In addition, all the analysis centers included in their processing precise SPOT-5 solar panel angle values and quaternions for, at least, the Jason satellites. Furthermore, a new Alcatel phase center variation model was implemented for the ITRF2020 processing. The main objective of this study is to present the combination process and to analyze the impact of the new modeling on the performance of the new combined solution. Comparisons with the IDS contribution to ITRF2014 show that i) the application of the new phase center variations for the Alcatel DORIS ground antennas in the data processing combined with the gradual replacement over time of the Alcatel by Starec antennas implies a scale drift from 1993.0 to 2002.5 and ii) thanks to a better modeling of the surface forces on the satellites, the new combined solution shows smaller annual and 118-day signals in the geocenter. A new DORIS terrestrial reference frame was computed to evaluate the intrinsic quality of the new combined solution. That evaluation shows that over almost the full time span the intrinsic IDS scale values lie in a range of ±5 mm. After mid-2008, the new DORIS reference frame has an internal position consistency in North-East-Up better than 7.5  mm."

Global  vegetation has been previously found to overall net cool land surfaces with cooling contributions from temperate and tropical vegetation and warming contributions from boreal vegetation. Recent studies suggest dryland vegetation across the tropics strongly contributes to this global net cooling feedback. However, observation-based vegetation-temperature interaction studies have been limited in the tropics, especially in their widespread drylands. Theoretical considerations also call into question the ability of dryland vegetation to strongly cool the surface under low water availability. Here, we use satellite observations to investigate how tropical vegetation cover influences the surface energy balance. We find that while increased vegetation cover would impart net cooling feedbacks across the tropics, net vegetal cooling effects are subdued in drylands. Using observations, we determine that dryland plants have less ability to cool the surface due to their cooling pathways being reduced by aridity, overall less efficient dissipation of turbulent energy, and their tendency to strongly increase solar radiation absorption. As a result, while proportional greening across the tropics would create an overall biophysical cooling feedback, dryland tropical vegetation reduces the overall tropical surface cooling 
magnitude by at least 14%, instead of enhancing cooling as suggested by previous global studies."

The timing of reversals is well documented for the past 160 Myr, but the conditions that lead to a reversal are still not well understood. It is not known if there are reliable ‘precursors’ of reversals (events that indicate that a reversal is upcoming) or what they might be. We investigate if machine learning (ML) techniques can reliably identify precursors of reversals based on time-series of the axial magnetic dipole field. The basic idea is to train a classifier using segments of time-series of the axial magnetic dipole. This training step requires modification of standard ML techniques to account for the fact that we are interested in rare events—a reversal is unusual, while a non-reversing field is the norm. Without our tweak, the ML classifiers lead to useless predictions. Perhaps even more importantly, the usable observational record is limited to 0–2 Ma and contains only five reversals, necessitating that we determine if the data are even sufficient to reliably train and validate an ML algorithm. To answer these questions we use several ML classifiers (linear/non-linear support vector machines and long short-term memory networks), invoke a hierarchy of numerical models (from simplified models to 3-D geodynamo simulations), and two palaeomagnetic reconstructions (PADM2M and Sint-2000). The performance of the ML classifiers varies across the models and the observational record and we provide evidence that this is not an artefact of the numerics, but rather reflects how ‘predictable’ a model or observational record is. Studying models of Earth’s magnetic field via ML classifiers thus can help with identifying shortcomings or advantages of the various models. For Earth’s magnetic field, we conclude that the ability of ML to identify precursors of reversals is limited, largely due to the small amount and low frequency resolution of data, which makes training and subsequent validation nearly impossible. Put simply: the ML techniques we tried are not currently capable of reliably identifying an axial dipole moment (ADM) precursor for geomagnetic reversals. This does not necessarily imply that such a precursor does not exist, and improvements in temporal resolution and length of ADM records may well offer better prospects in the future."

First Limits on Diffuse Light at 1.25, 1.4, and 1.6 μm","We present the first results from the HST Archival Legacy project ""SKYSURF."" As described in Windhorst et al., SKYSURF utilizes the large HST archive to study the diffuse UV, optical, and near-IR backgrounds and foregrounds in detail. Here, we utilize SKYSURF's first sky-surface-brightness measurements to constrain the level of near-IR diffuse Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) in three near-IR filters (F125W, F140W, and F160W). This is done by comparing our preliminary sky measurements of >30,000 images to zodiacal light models, carefully selecting the darkest images to avoid contamination from stray light. Our sky-surface-brightness measurements have been verified to an accuracy of better than 1%, which when combined with systematic errors associated with HST, results in sky-brightness uncertainties of ∼ 2%–4% ≃ 0.005 MJy sr−1 in each image. When compared to the Kelsall et al. zodiacal model, an isotropic diffuse background of ∼30 nW m−2 sr−1 remains, whereas using the Wright zodiacal model results in no discernible diffuse background. Based primarily on uncertainties in the foreground model subtraction, we present limits on the amount of diffuse EBL of 29, 40, and 29 nW m−2 sr−1, for F125W, F140W, and F160W, respectively. While this light is generally isotropic, our modeling at this point does not distinguish between a cosmological origin or a solar system origin (such as a dim, diffuse, spherical cloud of cometary dust)."

We describe the probability density function (PDF) of the monthly TOA SW flux and how the statistical third moment, skewness, can impact the quantification of the flux. The PDF of the SW flux is not normally distributed but positively skewed. In both sets of observations, the near-global (80S-80N) median value of the SW flux is ≈3 W/m<sup>2</sup> less than the mean value, due to the positive skewness of the distribution. The near-global mean TOA SW flux converted from MISR is about 7 W/m<sup>2</sup> (≈7%) less than CERES measured flux during the last two decades. Surprisingly, hemispheric asymmetry exists with TOA SW observations from Terra platform. SH reflects 3.92 W/m<sup>2</sup> and 1.15 W/m<sup>2</sup> more mean SW flux than NH, from MISR and CERES Single Scanner Footprint products, respectively. We can infer that the offsetting by morning clouds in the SH is greater than the effect of hemispheric imbalance of SW flux caused by different land masses in two hemispheres. While the characteristics of the two SW fluxes broadly agree with each other, differences in the regional PDF from two different SW fluxes are substantially different over high cloud regions and high altitude regions. Our analysis shows that some parts of the different skewness from two measurements may be attributed to  the different calibration of the radiance anisotropy over high cloud scenes."

Mineral transformation experiments were conducted by heating green rust suspensions at 85 °C in the presence of Ni2+, Zn2+, or Co2+ under strict anoxic conditions. Transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction showed the conversion of hexagonal green rust platelets to fine grained cubic magnetite crystals. The addition of Ni2+, Zn2+, and Co2+ resulted in faster rates of mineral transformation. The conversion of green rust to magnetite was concurrent to significant increases in metal uptake, demonstrating a strong affinity for metal sorption/ co-precipitation by magnetite. Dissolution ratio curves showed that Ni2+, Zn2+, and Co2+ cations were incorporated into the mineral structure during magnetite crystal growth. The results indicate that the transformation of green rust to magnetite is accelerated by metal impurities, and that magnetite is a highly effective scavenger of trace metals during mineral transformation. The implications for using diagenetic magnetite from green rust precursors as paleoproxies of Precambrian ocean chemistry are discussed."

The Fe ii* and Mg ii (continuum-subtracted) emissions span out to radial distances of ∼14.33 and 26.5 kpc, respectively, with maximum spatial extents of ∼21 kpc for Fe ii* emission and ∼30 kpc for Mg ii emission. Mg ii emission is patchy and covers a total area of ∼184 kpc2, constraining the minimum area covered by the outflowing gas to be ∼13% of the total area. Mg ii emission is asymmetric and shows ∼21% more extended emission along the decl. direction. We constrain the covering fractions of the Fe ii* and Mg ii emission as a function of radial distance and characterize them with a power-law model. The Mg ii 2803 emission line shows two kinematically distinct emission components and may correspond to two distinct shells of outflowing gas with a velocity separation of Δv ∼ 400 km s−1. By using multiple images with different magnifications of the galaxy in the image plane, we trace the Fe ii* and Mg ii emissions around three individual star-forming regions. In all cases, both the Fe ii* and Mg ii emissions are more spatially extended compared to the star-forming regions traced by the [O ii] emission. These findings provide robust constraints on the spatial extent of the outflowing gas and, combined with outflow velocity and column density measurements, will give stringent constraints on mass-outflow rates of the galaxy."

The planetary signal was observed by several ground-based telescopes, and the planet-host mass ratio is q = (2.65 ± 0.16) × 10(−3). The ground-based observations yield a constraint on the angular Einstein radius θE, and the microlensing parallax vector πE, is strongly constrained by the Spitzer data. However, the 2019 Spitzer baseline data reveal systematics in the Spitzer photometry, so there is ambiguity in the magnitude of the parallax. In our preferred interpretation, a full Bayesian analysis using a Galactic model indicates that the planetary system is composed of an Mplanet = 0.26+0.22 −0.11M(J) planet orbiting an Mhost = 0.093+0.082 −0.038 Mʘ , at a distance of DL = 3.71+3.24 −1.70 kpc. An alternate interpretation of the data shifts the localization of the minima along the arc-shaped microlens parallax constraints. This, in turn, yields a more massive host with median mass of 0.13 Mʘ  at a distance of 6.3 kpc. This analysis demonstrates the robustness of the osculating circles formalism, but shows that further investigation is needed to assess how systematics affect the specific localization of the microlens parallax vector and, consequently, the inferred physical parameters."

Fayette and Haywood counties in West Tennessee are situated within the recharge zone of the MA and include the forthcoming Ford “mega campus” named Blue Oval City (BOC), which will consist of a vehicle-production facility and battery assembly division. Increased water demand and land cover change resulting from urban development, such as BOC in the MA’s narrow recharge zone, threaten the aquifer’s groundwater storage and recharge rate. Groundwater recharge factors that influence the narrow recharge zone of the MA include precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and land cover type. In partnership with Protect Our Aquifer (POA) and the Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering Research (CAESAR) at the University of Memphis, the team used data from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM IMERG), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). The team also used ancillary data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) Noah Land Surface Model.

This study examines the global life cycle and direct radiative effects (DREs) of dust in the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1), and the impact of increasing model resolution both horizontally and vertically. The default 1° E3SMv1 captures the spatial and temporal variability in the observed dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD) reasonably well, but overpredicts dust absorption in the shortwave (SW). Simulations underestimate the dust vertical and long-range transport, compared with the satellite dust extinction profiles. After updating dust refractive indices and correcting for a bias in partitioning size-segregated emissions, both SW cooling and longwave (LW) warming of dust simulated by E3SMv1 are increased and agree better with other recent studies. The estimated net dust DRE of −0.42 Wm−2 represents a stronger cooling effect than the observationally based estimate −0.2 Wm−2 (−0.48 to +0.2), due to a smaller LW warming. Constrained by a global mean DAOD, model sensitivity studies of increasing horizontal and vertical resolution show strong influences on the simulated global dust burden and lifetime primarily through the change of dust dry deposition rate; there are also remarkable differences in simulated spatial distributions of DAOD, DRE, and deposition fluxes. Thus, constraining the global DAOD is insufficient for accurate representation of dust climate effects, especially in transitioning to higher- or variable-resolution ESMs. Better observational constraints of dust vertical profiles, dry deposition, size, and LW properties are needed."

Brown dwarfs are transition objects between stars and planets that are still poorly understood, for which several competing mechanisms have been proposed to describe their formation. Mass measurements are generally difficult to carry out for isolated objects as well as for brown dwarfs orbiting low-mass stars, which are often too faint for a spectroscopic follow-up.

Aims. Microlensing provides an alternative tool for the discovery and investigation of such faint systems. Here, we present an analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-0033/MOA-2019-BLG-035, which is caused by a binary system composed of a brown dwarf orbiting a red dwarf. 

Methods. Thanks to extensive ground observations and the availability of space observations from Spitzer, it has been possible to obtain accurate estimates of all microlensing parameters, including the parallax, source radius, and orbital motion of the binary lens.

Results. Following an accurate modeling process, we found that the lens is composed of a red dwarf with a mass of M(1) = 0:149 ± 0.010 M⊙ and a brown dwarf with a mass of M(2) = 0:0463 ± 0:0031 M at a projected separation of a⊥ = 0:585 au. The system has a peculiar velocity that is typical of old metal-poor populations in the thick disk. A percent-level precision in the mass measurement of brown dwarfs has been achieved only in a few microlensing events up to now, but will likely become more common in the future thanks to the Roman space telescope."

Switchbacks also tend to come in patches, with a large-scale modulation that appears to have a spatial scale size comparable to supergranulation on the Sun. Here we inspect data from the first 10 encounters of PSP focusing on different time intervals when clear switchback patches were observed by PSP. We show that the switchbacks modulation, on a timescale of several hours, seems to be independent of whether PSP is near perihelion, when it rapidly traverses large swaths of longitude remaining at the same heliocentric distance, or near the radial-scan part of its orbit, when PSP hovers over the same longitude on the Sun while rapidly moving radially inwards or outwards. This implies that switchback patches must also have an intrinsically temporal modulation most probably originating at the Sun. Between two consecutive patches, the magnetic field is usually very quiescent with weak fluctuations. We compare various parameters between the quiescent intervals and the switchback intervals. The results show that the quiescent intervals are typically less Alfvénic than switchback intervals, and the magnetic power spectrum is usually shallower in quiescent intervals. We propose that the temporal modulation of switchback patches may be related to the ""breathing"" of emerging flux that appears in images as the formation of ""bubbles"" below prominences in the Hinode/SOT observations."

The low densities and high temperatures of typical heliospheric environments lead to weakly collisional plasma conditions. Under these conditions, the energization of particles occurs primarily through collisionless interactions between the electromagnetic fields and the individual plasma particles with energies characteristic of a particular interaction. To understand how the plasma heating and particle acceleration impacts the macroscopic evolution of the heliosphere, impacting phenomena such as extreme space weather, it is critical to understand these collisionless wave-particle interactions on the characteristic ion and electron kinetic timescales. Such understanding requires high-cadence measurements of both the electromagnetic fields and the three-dimensional particle velocity distributions. Although existing instrument technology enables these measurements, a major challenge to maximize the scientific return from these measurements is the limited amount of data that can be transmitted to the ground due to telemetry constraints. A valuable, but underutilized, approach to overcome this limitation is to compute on-board correlations of the maximum-cadence field and particle measurements to improve the sampling time by several orders of magnitude. Here we review the fundamentals of the innovative field-particle correlation technique, present a formulation of the technique that can be implemented as an on-board wave-particle correlator, and estimate results that can be achieved with existing instrumental capabilities for particle velocity distribution measurements."

LAEs at high redshifts are sensitive probes of cosmic reionization, and narrowband imaging is a robust and effective method for selecting a large number of LAEs. In this work, we present results from the spectroscopic follow-up of LAE candidates in two LAGER fields, COSMOS and WIDE-12, using observations from Keck/LRIS. We report the successful detection of Lyα emission in 15 candidates. Three of these in COSMOS have matching confirmations from a previous spectroscopic follow-up and are part of the overdense region, LAGER-z7OD1. Two other candidates that were not detected with LRIS have prior spectroscopic confirmations from Magellan. Including these, we obtain a spectroscopic confirmation success rate of ∼80% for LAGER LAE candidates. Thorough checks were performed to reject the possibility of these detections being foreground emission resulting with a probability of, at most, one contaminant. We do not detect any other UV nebular lines in our LRIS spectra, apart from Lyα. We estimate a 2σ upper limit for the ratio of N v/Lyα, fNV/fLyα ≲ 0.27. Including confirmations from this work, a total of 33 LAE sources from LAGER are now spectroscopically confirmed.

To establish the evolutionary status of the clumps, their positions were compared with previously identified young stellar objects (YSOs) from the Spitzer/SAGE and Herschel/HERITAGE surveys, as well as water and OH masers. We compared the properties of the clumps in N113 to those in the Galaxy and other regions in the LMC to assess the impact of the environment (e.g., metallicity, stellar feedback) on the star formation process."

We explore these interactions using a diverse suite of data: cosmic microwave background anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillations, the Lyman-α forest, and the abundance of Milky-Way subhalos. We derive constraints using model-independent parameterizations of the dark matter–electron and dark matter–proton interaction cross sections and map these constraints onto concrete dark matter models. Our constraints are complementary to other probes of dark matter interactions with ordinary matter, such as direct detection, big bang nucleosynthesis, various astrophysical systems, and accelerator based experiments. They exclude sufficiently large cross sections for a large range of dark matter masses, which cannot be accessed by direct-detection experiments due to the overburden from the Earth’s atmosphere or crust."

This study uses student investigation research reports and posters submitted to the 2018 International Virtual Science Symposium (IVSS) and Student Research Symposium (SRS) as testbeds for characterizing student-driven Earth system citizen science investigations. Secondarily, this study aimed to capture GLOBE’s alignment to existing citizen science outcomes frameworks in the literature, which have primarily focused on adults and non-formal settings. Based on a literature review, the evaluation team identified 89 potential characteristics in 27 categories to typify investigations from both formal education and citizen science perspectives. We coded the artifacts from 207 student projects, conducted quantitative analysis of frequencies, and performed a semantic network analysis. By using this networking approach, we conceptually mapped several clusters of co-occurring characteristics, defining a descriptive framework for GLOBE projects. We identified three tiers of citizen science projects, increasing in the sophistication of participants’ demonstrated science practices. The framework includes additional components that reflect student citizen scientists’ thoughtfulness and connection to context as well as their projects’ reflection of their motivation and self efficacy. Through these findings, we have identified areas where student citizen scientists would benefit from further support, and suggest here further research to incorporate the experiences of students into the broader understanding of citizen science outcomes."

Nationwide, millions of forested hectares, both private and public, are disappearing functionally and physically throguh serve wildfire fire and land coversion. On many of these lands, management, centered on fire supression, has led to reductions in forest resilience to wildfire. Lands, overstocked with accumulated fuel and faced with a changing climate, are expected to continue this legacy of fire and deteriorating health. A paradigm shift is needed to face the challenges confronting forests and enhance collaborative efforts across multiple foret ownerships. Our ability to leverage emerging technologies and pair them with the knowledge of indigenous peoples presents new opportunities for success. The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the Anchor Forest concept as a framework to leverage collaborative motivations and leadership by indigenous peoples (Tribes) in eastern Washington State to improve forest ecosystem health across legal and political boundaries, 'cross-boundary' management, and 2) demonstrate how the NASA carbon monitoring system (CMS) mapping of products of regional forestland above ground biomass (AGB) density and temporal trends can provide information that supports decisionmakers in their efforts to collaboratively approach improving forest health conditions through management activities."

The spectrum shows tentative evidence for a water absorption feature in the 1.1–1.7 μm wavelength range with a small amplitude of 30 ppm (corresponding to just 0.8 ± 0.04 atmospheric scale heights). Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis, the presence of water vapor is tentatively favored with a Bayes factor of 1.7–2.6 (depending on prior assumptions). The spectrum is most consistent with either an enhanced metallicity or high-altitude condensates, or both. Cloud-free solar composition atmospheres are ruled out at >5σ confidence. We compare the spectrum to grids of cloudy and hazy forward models and find that the spectrum is fit well by models with moderate cloud lofting or haze formation efficiency over a wide range of metallicities (1–100× solar). We combine the constraints on the envelope composition with an interior structure model and estimate that the core mass fraction is ≳0.3. With a bulk composition reminiscent of that of Neptune and an orbital distance of 0.15 au, HD 106315c hints that planets may form out of broadly similar material and arrive at vastly different orbits later in their evolution."

Decreasing trends are shown for aerosol optical depth (AOD), Ångstr¨om exponent (AE), and fine mode fraction (FMF) in all countries. The decreasing trend in these data is considered to be due to a decrease in anthropogenic emissions. For the aerosol type frequency, decreases in the proportions of carbonaceous aerosols (CA) and non-absorbing aerosols (NA) were shown in the ground and satellite data, respectively. At most sites, the fractions of low AOD case (LOW) increased, whereas those of the Black and Brown Carbon (BC + BrC) category decreased. In Seoul, the fraction of LOW increased from 48.9% to 70.0%, and that of BC + BrC decreased continuously from 20.4% to 11.1% during 2012–2019. Beijing, on the other hand, showed decreasing LOW from 83.3% (2012) to 52.0% (2019), and that of BC + BrC increased significantly, from 2.4% to 26.2%. The satellite data showed that the percentage of LOW increased continuously, while that of NA aerosols decreased continuously in East Asia. A noticeable decrease in the fraction of CA was detected in China [21.5% (2013) to 11.2% (2019)]. In all countries, CA and NA aerosols had the greatest effect in winter and summer, respectively. We also detected significant differences between the fractions of NA and BC between the ground and satellite data. Changes in aerosol type and properties were observed concurrently in all ground and satellite data, and changes in aerosol type may explain the increasing and decreasing trends that we recorded for most parameters. Consistent results from both ground and satellite data suggest a steady decreasing in fine aerosol pollution in East Asia."

Unfortunately, strong attenuation by the interstellar medium (ISM) obscures the line core in most stars, requiring the intrinsic Lyα flux to be reconstructed based on fits to the line wings. We present a test of the widely used Lyα emission-line reconstruction code ւʏᴀᴘʏ using phase-resolved, medium-resolution STIS G140M observations of the close white dwarf–M dwarf binary EG UMa. The Doppler shifts induced by the binary orbital motion move the Lyα emission line in and out of the region of strong ISM attenuation. Reconstructions of each spectrum should produce the same Lyα profile regardless of phase, under the well-justified assumption that there is no intrinsic line variability between observations. Instead, we find that the reconstructions underestimate the Lyα flux by almost a factor of 2 for the lowest velocity, most attenuated spectrum, due to a degeneracy between the intrinsic Lyα and ISM profiles. Our results imply that many stellar Lyα fluxes derived from G140M spectra reported in the literature may be underestimated, with potential consequences for, for example, estimates of extreme-ultraviolet stellar spectra and ultraviolet inputs into simulations of exoplanet atmospheres."

It is planned to consist of a dedicated atmospheric composition instrument (ACX) to support air quality forecasting and monitoring by providing capabilities similar to missions such as TEMPO (Tropospheric Emission: Monitoring Pollution), currently planned to launch in 2023, as well as OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument), TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), and GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer) currently in operation. As the early phases of ACX development are progressing, design trade-offs are being considered to understand the relationship between instrument design choices and trace gas retrieval impacts. Some of these choices will affect the instrument polarization sensitivity (PS), which can have radiometric impacts on environmental satellite observations. We conducted a study to investigate how such radiometric impacts can affect NO2 retrievals by exploring their sensitivities to time of day, location, and scene type with an ACX instrument model that incorporates PS. The study addresses the basic steps of operational NO2 retrievals: the spectral fitting step and the conversion of slant column to vertical column via the air mass factor (AMF). The spectral fitting step was performed by generating at-sensor radiance from a clear-sky scene with a known NO2 amount, the application of an instrument model including both instrument PS and noise, and a physical retrieval. The spectral fitting step was found to mitigate the impacts of instrument PS. The AMF-related step was considered for clear-sky and partially cloudy scenes, for which instrument PS can lead to errors in interpreting the cloud content, propagating to AMF errors and finally to NO2 retrieval errors. For this step, the NO2 retrieval impacts were small but non-negligible for high NO2 amounts; we estimated that a typical high NO2 amount can cause a maximum retrieval error of 0.25×1015 molec. cm−2 for a PS of 5 %. These simulation capabilities were designed to aid in the development of a GeoXO atmospheric composition instrument that will improve our ability to monitor and understand the Earth's atmosphere."

We investigated the role of sex differences in the subjective experience and objective cognitive manifestation of sleep inertia following nighttime awakenings.

<strong>Methods:</strong> Thirty-two healthy adults (16 female, 25.91 ± 5.63 years) completed a one-week at-home study with one experimental night during which sleep was measured by polysomnography and participants were awakened during their habitual sleep time. Participants completed a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), visual analog mood scales, and a descending subtraction task (DST) prior to sleep (baseline) and at 2, 12, 22, and 32 minutes after awakening. A series of mixed-effects models with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests were used to examine the main effects of test bout and sex, and their interaction, with a random effect of participant, and order of wake-up and sleep history as covariates.

<strong>Results:</strong> All outcomes except for percent correct on the DST showed a significant main effect of test bout, with worse performance after waking compared to baseline (all <em>p</em>s < .003). Significant effects of sex (<em>p</em> = .002) and sex × test bout (<em>p</em> = .01; R<sup>2</sup><sub>M</sub> = .49, R<sup>2</sup><sub>C</sub> = .69) were observed for KSS, with females reporting a greater increase in sleepiness from baseline to after waking compared to males.

<strong>Conclusions</strong>: These results suggest that while females reported feeling sleepier than males following nighttime awakenings, their cognitive performance was comparable. Future research is needed to determine whether perceptions of sleepiness influence decision-making during the transition from sleep to wakefulness."

Mathematical proximity does not necessarily lead to consistent retrievals due to limited information content of passive microwave observations. This paper defines imposter (genuine) vectors of brightness temperature as those that are mathematically close but physically inconsistent (consistent) and characterizes them through the Silhouette Coefficient (SC) analysis. The Neyman–Pearson (NP) hypothesis testing is used to separate the imposter and genuine brightness temperatures based on their associated values of cloud ice (IWP) and liquid water path (LWP), given by coincidences of CloudSat Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI). The study determines thresholds for IWP and LWP that allow optimal identification of imposter brightness temperatures of non-snowing and snowing clouds, which can mislead the passive microwave retrieval algorithms to falsely detect or miss the
snowfall events. It is demonstrated that emission signal of supercooled liquid water in snowing clouds can lead to improved passive microwave retrieval of snowfall and conditioning the retrievals to the cloud IWP and LWP can result in marginal correction of the snowfall detection probability; however, reduce the probability of false alarm by 6%–8% over sea ice and open oceans."

Previous work showed that the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission Goddard PROFiling (GPROF) algorithm snowfall retrieval performance strongly depends on the snowfall type. In particular, PMW-based detection of shallow cumuliform snowfall (SCS), which accounts for 36%-70% of global snowfall frequency, can be very challenging. The snowfall scattering signal can be contaminated by the background surface or supercooled cloud liquid water emission. A scattering index (SI) approach that exploits the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) dual-polarization 166 GHz channels is developed to analyze its behavior in presence of SCS over ocean. Case studies show that, compared to the SI at 89 GHz, it can isolate the SCS snowfall scattering signal in extremely dry conditions. Some issues are still observed in presence of supercooled liquid water."

This technology addresses a need for more aggressive sampling and drilling techniques, for both scientific purposes and to obtain In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) resources for future NASA missions and human crew support. Using a spool of lightweight, high-pressure capillary, a DTH drill assembly would be moved in and out of the hole that could be a kilometer or more in depth. The CO2 drill is designed so that Mars atmospheric CO2 could be collected, compressed, and supplied down the hole and routed through microducts, valves, and reservoirs for the purpose of controlling miniature mechanical actuation in the assembly. By using compressed CO2, the drill system avoids the need for heavy electrical cabling and actuator systems or a liquid media for carrying away particulates as is typically used in terrestrial drilling systems. Instead, the liquid CO2 that powers the drill expands to a gas and could be channeled around the drill housing to carry cuttings to be collected in a bailing bucket. Where terrestrial systems often use drill depth vs time as a metric, a Mars drilling system would need to be extremely low mass, but would have no need to perform under tight schedules. In this paper, we will document our trade studies, progression for the design of microduct logic verified through multiple generations of prototypes, and provide predictive performance data on energy consumption, hole depth, and drill time."

InSight’s Entry,Descent, and Landing sequence included an 11.8-m supersonicallydeployed Disk-Gap-Band parachute that was a largelybuild-to-print version of the parachute used to successfully landthe Phoenix lander a decade earlier. This paper describes thereconstructed performance of InSight’s supersonic parachuteat Mars, highlighting the differences and similarities with theperformance of Phoenix’s parachute. Measurements from theonboard inertial measurement unit along with pre-launch measurementsof the parachute system and spacecraft, assumptionsabout the vehicle’s aerodynamics, and models for the Martianatmosphere were used to reconstruct the spacecraft’s trajectoryand the parachute system’s performance. The reconstruction resultswere compared against pre-flight predictions. Reconstructionof the InSight trajectory leading up to parachute deploymentshowed that the vehicle trimmed in a lift-down orientationduring entry and thus experienced greater deceleration thanexpected by most pre-flight simulations. This led to parachutedeployment conditions that diverged from the nominal preflightpredictions. The parachute was mortar-deployed at aMach number of approximately 1.5, below the nominal preflightexpectation of 1.66. The approximate dynamic pressureat mortar fire was between 518 Pa and 546 Pa, which agreedwell with pre-flight expectations. The mortar system performednominally, and the system’s deployment (0.755 s) and inflation(1.1 s) times were in line with pre-flight modeling. The peakinflation load was 45 kN, well below the parachute’s 67 kNdesign limit load. Following deployment of the parachute,the vehicle’s rotational rates and the dynamics of the systemwere in excellent agreement with pre-flight expectations. Theperformance of the InSight parachute system was also foundto agree well with that of the Phoenix parachute system, asexpected given the similarities between the two systems."

In the case of robotics for interplanetary exploration, these systems can leverage origamiinspired folding for increased mobility options and reduced storage volume. Folding rigid-flex PCB robotics can be constructed with rigid PCB connected by short Nomex fabric hinges coupled with flex PCB ribbon cables that permits enhanced system flexibility and energy dissipation to promote impact survivability. This paper presents a design methodology of rigidflex PCB systems with an emphasis on impact resistance. The design process considers solder joint adequacy, panel bending, and fracture using a finite element (FE) model. The proposed design methodology is developed using a case study with NASA JPL’s Pop-Up Folding Flat Explorer Robot (PUFFER). First, the finite-element (FE) modeling methodology is presented with consideration to both frequency and time-domain modeling applications, which include operational self-contact analysis and high impact scenarios. The time-domain impact modeling methodology utilizes hyperelastic material properties for the Nomex hinges. This modeling method is validated using image correlation of PUFFER drop tests. A flowchart is presented to guide users through a validated Abaqus modeling procedure for highly flexible rigid-flex systems. Next, a case study is presented in which PUFFER is subject to drop heights representative of falls into Lunar pits and then the design is refined for a more optimum impact performance. Finally, the results of the case study are used to inform a generalized design methodology for rigid-flex PCB robotics subject to high-impact loads with the considerations presented."

The mission will use IR laser technology to search for volatiles and surface water ice deposits in the permanently shadowed regions (PSR) of the moon in preparation for future human lunar exploration. The fine pointing provided by the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) system is crucial for the spacecraft to successfully reach the moon, enter a lunar orbit, and acquire scientific data. At the center of the GNC system’s ability to determine the spacecraft’s attitude is a star tracker. The LF star tracker is a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) unit built into the integrated GNC system provided by Blue Canyon Technologies. Blue Canyon tested the star tracker in a lab environment for basic functionality and attitude estimation capabilities; upon delivery of the hardware to JPL, further testing with a real night sky was desired to determine expected in-flight operational characteristics. JPL maintains the Table Mountain Facility with its suite of ground telescopes, including a 0.6m telescope with an equatorial mount. This stable platform provided a highly accurate method of providing slews and attitude holds akin to what the spacecraft will perform in flight. Therefore, by analyzing the data from these representative night-sky ground tests performed in March, 2021, it is possible to acquire expected flight performance of the star tracker, particularly in regard to the ability of the star tracker to maintain lock on the starfield during planned maneuver types. This paper presents the various tests that have been performed to ensure that the LF star tracker will function as part of the overall GNC system and integrated spacecraft once launched. Test data is included for several key tests, and a path forward towards future integration and testing at the spacecraft level is described."

It includes an overview of CFDP, the history of why CFDP was chosen, how it benefits mission operations, some of the mission scenarios that stress CFDP, operability aspects, the best practices that Clipper adopted from other missions and some of the technical challenges with implementation, and verification and validation. The benefits to mission operations accrue because CFDP reduces the need for manual management of file transfer, including retransmission of missing data, and deletion of files only after confirmation of receipt by the ground. The challenges occur because CFDP is a round-trip protocol – it requires messages in both directions to complete a file transfer, and because it uses timers to ensure that control messages are resent if needed to prevent transactions from going stale. Any situations where communication is restricted to a single direction, interrupted, reordered, or backlogged can pose a challenge. There are also implementation challenges. Europa Clipper is the first mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to adopt class 2, fully acknowledged, CFDP for both uplink and downlink. The implementation needed new software, requirements and operational procedures. The experience of the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) with CFDP from their previous missions was crucial to success for Europa Clipper. Because CFDP relies on timers and messages travel in both directions, verification and validation (V&V) requires new approaches. For certain scenarios, a live ground system talking to a live flight system with realistic simulated one-way light times, data rates and data outages must be used."

The combination of a subsurface liquid water layer in contact with a rocky seafloor may yield an ocean rich in the elements and energy needed for the emergence of life, and for potentially sustaining life through time. Europa may hold the clues to one of NASA’s long-standing quests – to determine whether or not we are alone in the universe. The Europa Clipper mission will characterize Europa’s habitability as the first step in the search for potential life at Europa by conducting approximately four dozen flybys.  The project is preparing for a System Integration Review in November of 2021. This paper will summarize changes from the mission’s Preliminary Design Review (PDR) baseline, including science objectives, launch vehicle, interplanetary trajectory, science tour, flight system, payload and mission phases. Since PDR several of the Level 1 science requirements were descoped and the science requirement flow was realigned, in order to control cost growth. The realignment deemphasized science redundancy, which had resulted in an over-constrained science tour, in favor of a more targeted linkage to the primary responding instrument. Additionally, changes to the PDR flight system design baseline include changes to the sounding radar antenna design, the magnetometer architecture, and the heat redistribution system pumps. All changes have been incorporated into a reference science tour used to demonstrate that the requirements and design of the flight system and payload are mature enough to support flight builds."

The DSAC mission has been conducting a two-year demonstration of a mercury ion atomic clock to characterize its space-based performance and to validate its utility for deep space navigation and radio science. Analysis of the collected data using JPL’s GIPSY-OASIS software has shown DSAC’s AD at one-day to be near 310-15; much better than required AD of 210-14. Such low spacecraft clock errors will enable one-way radiometric tracking data with precision equivalent to or better than current-day two way tracking data, allowing a shift to a more efficient and flexible one-way deep space navigation architecture. To verify this, an analog deep space navigation experiment was performed using JPL’s operational navigation software (Monte). The experiment recovered orbit solutions with reduced data sets and geometric variations that are more representative of deep space missions, and showed that orbit determination using DSAC derived data is on par with more traditional two-way datatypes. As a technology demonstrator, DSAC’s development focus has been on maturing the mercury ion trap clock technology rather than achieving the smallest size, weight, and power (SWaP). Over the course of DSAC’s development the project has identified numerous improvements that could be made to significantly reduce SWaP for DSAC’s next version. Indeed, DSAC-2 was recently selected by NASA for further demonstration on the VERITAS mission to Venus. This work will review the DSAC technology, mission, and results from its two-year mission."

This typically requires extracting a sample from its place of origin prior to examination, which may be days after collection. Oftentimes, the solution is to bring the lab to the ocean, which may be costly and provide further limitations for a sterile and stable laboratory environment. Here we present a low-cost, submersible, digital holographic microscope (DHM) designed to image marine microorganisms (such as bacteria and plankton) in their natural underwater environment. Our instrument eliminates the need to transport samples and allows for instantaneous data collection of microbes in-situ. The DHM achieves sub-micron spatial resolution and is paired with artificial intelligence for the detection and tracking of specimens to reduce the overall collected data. This instrument also aims to reduce the cost of manufacturing and field expenses relative to marine microbiological research. “Off the shelf” components were selected in the design process of this instrument which allows us to achieve precise results without sacrificing data quality. The DHM itself costs under one thousand dollars and features a low-cost high-resolution camera, the Arducam MT9J001. Included in the design were five main subsystems: optical, mechanical, electrical, power, and machine learning. Our on board computer and artificial intelligence consist of a Raspberry Pi 4 (8 Gb) and Google Coral USB Tensorflow accelerator. Instrument testing has successfully proven our abilities of data acquisition for at least two hours in depths of at least forty meters below sea level. Additionally, our artificial intelligence system is currently capable of tracking up to ten areas of interest in a fraction of a second with over ninety percent confidence via the neural net driven by the tensor cores on the Google Coral. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the versatility of our instrument by mounting it on an ocean-going ROV, the BlueRov2 by BlueRobotics.

The spacecraft measures this elemental composition using the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), which detects cosmic-ray induced gamma rays from Psyche’s surface. In addition to gamma rays from Psyche, the GRS will also detect background gamma rays from spacecraft material nearby the GRS. Because Ni is such a key element for achieving the mission science objectives, a special effort has been made to minimize background gamma rays from Ni, thus maximizing sensitivity to the Ni gamma rays from Psyche. The Psyche mission approached this potential Ni background issue with two methods, locating the GRS away from the spacecraft/source of Ni and setting a threshold requirement against the total Ni mass of the spacecraft. Verifying that the total amount of Ni on the spacecraft is within this threshold is thus a key part of ensuring the GRS can meet its science objectives.  Ni alloys are commonly used on spacecraft, but the mass and location of elemental Ni is not typically accounted for. Ni can be found in many materials all over the spacecraft – in fasteners, optical assemblies, magnetic shields, electromagnetic interference (EMI) tape, under gold plating, in connectors, and so on. The task proved further challenging because of the distributed nature of the build of this spacecraft and the use of vendors external to JPL. While the analysis was atypical and source information difficult to cull, the approach described in this paper used tools and data available to the project in some form to achieve this goal. For Psyche, current analysis shows there is margin in meeting the Ni mass requirement. This paper explains the systematic approach used to accurately and precisely record Ni content on the Psyche spacecraft. While this approach was defined for Ni on the Psyche mission, it can be used for any future project with the need to accurately estimate the total mass of a single element or material on a spacecraft."

It leads directly to concepts of “risk tolerance”, and risk-based decision-making. It would be valuable if there was a way to compute the optimal investment in customer-executed quality assurance activities using defect significance with respect to performance objectives, the activities’ defect detection effectiveness, and the cost-penalty for late discovery of impactful defects. This optimization is particularly of interest to projects whose budget constraints significantly limit their risk management options.The cost to fix defects (i.e., failure correction) escalates as the project matures. There have been studies attempting to determine the relative cost of fixing defects discovered during various phases of a project life cycle with important implications, all of which suggest growth factors are large. The commonly referred to 1:10:100 rule represents a cost multiplier for repair/rework across the Design to Fab to Test hardware development phases. Cost premiums for QA activities also accumulate when they are treated as mandatory (due to schedule drag) or are performed later than their assigned phase.This paper describes the modeling of development phase -dependencies in the conduct of typical customer-executed quality assurance activities. Our initial modeling encompasses:•	Distinct phases of the production lifecycle•	Multiple kinds of Defects, each with some a-priori likelihood of being present•	Each defect’s impact on performance Objectives for a type of hardware•	The cost and efficacy of assurance techniques at detecting such Defects•	The costs of fixing those Defects detected in a given phase of the production lifecycleThe model captures assurance activities’ abilities to Detect defects. Upon detection it is assumed that the Defect is immediately fixed. Defects that “escape” detection by some activity may thereafter be detected by a later activity, but by then the cost of fixing the Defect may have escalated. Defects are related to the performance Objectives they would detract from, were those Defects to remain present in the operating system.We have constructed and are exploring, a model that relates the importance of hardware system elements to mission objectives, the impact of types of Defects on those hardware types, the cost of customer-executed assurance activities (i.e., supplier controls) and their effectiveness towards reducing an impactful quality escape, and the cost of Defect correction across production phase. We describe the approach taken to select the key model aspects, why they are relevant to our NASA mission, and our efforts to populate it with relevant and contemporary data. We use a notional example to illustrate model design and function."

Operating the spacecraft safely will require the dedicated efforts of a small team that understands the spacecraft’s operational constraints, as well as a set of powerful spacecraft models designed to catch command errors that can pose risks to mission success. One of the responsibilities of the operations team is to ensure adherence to a set of Flight Rules written by spacecraft and instrument experts that are designed to mitigate these risks. Psyche’s innovations in Flight Rule design principles and advancements in the tools and processes used to implement and check Flight Rules are discussed. A comparison of Psyche’s approach to Flight Rules to other JPL missions will provide lessons learned for future missions that must perform constraint checking during operations. Flight Rule development faces several major challenges. First, flight rule developers must work with Subject Matter Experts (SME) to write the rules in a way that captures the intent of the constraint in a straightforward, enforceable manner. Second, software implementers must correctly interpret flight rules into code so that it meets the original intent of the SME. Finally, a means must be provided for SMEs to validate flight rule implementations without requiring them to understand the underlying software. Innovative processes intended to efficiently close the loop between stakeholders and software developers are described, such as the use of test-driven development to provide stakeholders with easy-to-review implementations. New guidelines for flight rule writing, designed to address these challenges, are described for future missions to adopt and build upon. Psyche Mission System has a variety of new and heritage tools that improve in the Flight Rule validation and checking process. Psyche developed a powerful, new tool called RandSEQ and made significant improvements to Octopusjam, two valuable tools that aid the development of Flight Rule unit tests. Advancements in the models and processes for performing sequence validation with SEQuence GENerator (SEQGEN), the primary, high-heritage tool used for automated flight rule checks on Psyche, are described. The development of new software and the advancements to existing software put Psyche at the forefront of Flight Rule technology. All missions must perform detailed constraint checking, so a comparison of Psyche’s approach to some of these items to the approaches taken by other missions such as Dawn, M2020, and Europa Clipper is done, specifically to examine SME-developer communication, tools used, and development process. Lessons learned from this comparison will be provided."

The SCS team established three primary system test campaigns and venues to aid in the development of SCS through verification and validation testing – Qualification Model Dirty Testing (QMDT) to provide a venue for testing in a Martian environment, Vehicle System Testbed (VSTB) for testing while integrated with the mobility subsystem on Martian-like terrain, and the Flight Software Testbed (FSWTB) for conducting tests using the flight motor controllers and software system on a hexapod which had the ability to simulate rover tilt. Each venue contributed a vital piece to the SCS building blocks. However, the QMDT venue operating within a 10-ft diameter Thermal Vacuum chamber to simulate Martian environment provided a sui generis opportunity to fine tune the entire sampling and caching process while building the team’s knowledge base about rock drillability, system life, and target selection. On Earth, because Martian rocks are not readily available, the development team must utilize geoanalogs to the rocks and regolith on Mars. Geologists on the team helped establish a set of standard rock types to use for Mars missions, like Basalt, Sandstone, Mudstone, Gypsum, and other related geoanalogs. These geoanalogs are characterized with a standard suite of tests for density, compressibility, and other characteristics to categorize potential drillability. This concept of drillability is what links the geoanalogs on Earth to the samples we collect on Mars. With the simulant characteristics defined, these geoanalog rocks are ready to be drilled into as we do on the Martian surface. A key aspect of interacting with the surface on Mars is rock target identification and selection. The Perseverance robotic system uses the on-board cameras, instrumentation, and software to collect enough information to identify potential scientific targets. With the targets identified, SCS can place the Corer and abrade the surface or collect a sample. For a ground test activity like QMDT, the test team did not have all of the camera and instrumentation systems that the rover does, so the team developed ground test equivalents to process a rock, build a target map, and define the target. The team constructed a Rock Scanning Station to build a 3D point cloud of the rock. This point cloud was then processed and evaluated with predefined and programmed criteria in a Target Downselect Tool. A primary output of the Target Downselect Tool is a defined target that can be uploaded directly to the robotic software system to simulate and build the robotic sequences used in tests. With these insights and programmatic definition of targets, the QMDT test team was able to make the same decisions that the Perseverance surface operations team does. In addition, valuable lessons learned from developing the target selection ground tools and using them were implemented into the tools used for surface operations."

Mission planners determined the project needed to develop a system that would enable the operations team to analyze engineering and science data, make science decisions, select viable rover targets at a millimeter resolution and validate an uplink bundle for a car sized rover with more complex science instruments than any previous Mars surface mission. All this had to be done within a five hour time frame. Doing this with a small team would be a challenge, but this had to be accomplished by a large team of engineers and scientists located across North America and Europe. Achieving this level of operational efficiency was unheard of in the prime mission. In addition, the mission had another set of requirements that had nothing to do with surface operations; the Mars 2020 Ground Data System (GDS) was also expected to comply with a new set of security requirements to keep up with the ever changing cybersecurity landscape. The Mars 2020 Ground Data System (GDS) is a re-architected version of the Mars Science Laboratory GDS. The primary goal was to integrate the lessons learned from previous Mars surface missions, accommodate a set of new requirements and capabilities required to ensure mission success, and comply with a new set of cybersecurity controls. The new architecture includes several unique qualities including a data lake, language-agnostic system-wide event-based operations, containerization, automated deployment, network segmentation, infrastructure-as-code, API-driven interfaces, and the first Mars surface GDS to operate primarily in the cloud. The new architecture enabled greater access to the system’s data, tighter integration with the operations team, and a higher level of traceability. The availability of the data also enabled a new set of capabilities previously not possible on surface missions. These new capabilities include an autonomous data to information, pipeline for downlink analysis, horizontal scaling of science data processing capabilities, autonomous round trip data tracking of science and engineering data, integration of flight system state into the tactical planning cycle, high fidelity targeting utilizing kinematic data, and hierarchical image and 3d meshes data representations. This paper will introduce the requirements for the Mars 2020 Mission, the heritage architecture, and the rationale for the changes to achieve the new architecture. The paper will continue to describe the fundamental changes made to the GDS architecture, how these changes enabled a more tightly integrated GDS, and the new capabilities that were enabled by the new architecture. The paper will conclude with the lessons learned from the process of rearchitecting a heritage GDS system and from the first 200 days of operations supporting over 800 users from around the world."
351,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20230007031,2023-08-03,New Rover Conops with High-Performance Onboard Computing: Give Up Raw Data to Reduce Ops Cost and Do More Science,"A major portion of time during the tactical operation of Mars rovers is spent for selecting, prioritizing, and coordinating sciences and engineering activities such that they fit within resource constraints, including the downlink data volume, energy, and time. In particular, the downlink data volume constraint is getting particularly tighter in recent missions because modern instruments produce increasingly high data volume while the communication bandwidth is essentially bounded by the law of physics. Tactical operation would be substantially simplified, hence the operation cost could be reduced, if the data volume constraint is relaxed or even removed. In this abstract, we propose a new operation paradigm for achieving this goal. The key observation is that, both in science and engineering applications, the bit size of raw data is typically much greater than the volume of processed information that is needed for scientific or engineering analysis. For example, a full-resolution image from Mastcam-Z, the main science camera on Perseverance, is about 700 kB in volume and we downlinked 29,685 images up to Sol 243, totaling ~20 GB of data. But of course, scientists do not use every pixel of these images; what they really look for in the images are geological features, typically represented by specific geometric configurations or textures. An end product after processing hundreds of Mascam-Z images could be a single geological map summarizing the spatial distribution of the features. For another example, a 100-meter drive of Perseverance produces 7-12 MB of drive telemetry, which records every detail of the rover's motion at 8 Hz, including position, attitude, steering angles, encoder readings, motor currents and many other information. But what the ground engineers eventually pay attention to is the signs of anomaly, such as excessive motor currents or high slip; if a drive is nominal, the vast majority of this data is unused. What if, then, we process the raw data onboard and only downlink the processed data that is relevant to scientific or engineering analyses, such as a list of detected science features (with cropped images) or a list of potential signs of anomaly while driving? A major roadblock for such onboard, high-level information processing has been the onboard computational resource. RAD750, the main onboard computer of Perseverance, is obviously not sufficient for performing complex image or signal processing such as object detection, semantic segmentation, or anomaly detection. Interestingly, RAD750 is not the best processor that Perseverance has; Qualcomm's Snapdragon 801, a modern mobile processor, is on her Heli Base Station, a device for communicating with Mars Helicopter Ingenuity; also, Intel's Atom E3845 processors are on engineering cameras. In the reminder of this paper, we will introduce two particular uses cases of these high-performance co-processors (meaning auxiliary CPU, GPU, or other types of processors that are separate from the main processor that runs the main flight software) for lowering operation cost and accommodating more science activities for a given communication constraint."

These systems would deliver waste heat for ice-melting in the range of 10 kW. Minimizing the transit time through the kilometers-thick ice shells to just a few years requires these RPS to utilize heat sources having a higher thermal energy volumetric density than the existing flight-qualified General-Purpose Heat Source (GPHS). A Compact Heat Source (CPHS)has been conceptualized in which the graphite impact shells(GIS) of the existing GPHS are rearranged in a hexagonal aeroshell containing seven GIS per module, as opposed to the standard two per module; offering a thermal energy density of 0.57 W/cm3versus 0.29 W/cm3 offered by the GPHS simply from the repackaging of Technology Readiness Level (TRL)9 subassemblies. Preliminary thermal modeling of the CPHS integrated into a notional radioisotope thermoelectric generator(RTG) structure further suggests that centerline temperatures are well within allowable limits during nominal operation. Given the need for the CPHS for a subset of missions, it is worth exploring the applicability of the CPHS for more general RTG purposes. We discuss herein how the CPHS may be implemented with either heritage or in-development thermoelectric converter technologies into a Next-Generation RTG concept. Due to a higher energy density, the legacy heat rejection fin arrangement must be modified to permit a sufficiently low cold-side temperature. Preliminary finite element analysis suggests fin-root temperatures can be kept as low as 520 K while allowing the generator to fit within the usable dimensions of currently available United States Department of Energy shipping containers. Such temperatures would certainly be compatible with the use of high temperature thermoelectric converter technologies.. A prime candidate is the heritage silicon-germanium (SiGe) unicouple, whose design could be adapted by approximately halving the leg-length, but without changes in hot and cold junction interfaces, which are features critical to the proven performance and  reliability  of  these  devices.  The  estimated  Beginning  of Life power for a SiGe-based CPHS-RTG using 12 CPHS for a thermal inventory of 10.5 kW is greater than 600 W under deep space operating conditions. Using higher performance segmented couples currently in development that are based on skutterudite,La3−xTe4and 14-1-11 Zintl thermoelectric materials in lieu of the SiGe unicouples would increase the power level to more than1 kW. The high specific power (We/kg) attribute of CPHS-RTGs found in this study could potentially enable Radioisotope Electric Propulsion (REP) mission concepts. Past NASA REP mission concept studies identified specific power needs in excess of 6to 8 We/kg. Based on a GPHS-RTG-like system configuration, we show that at fin root temperatures between 530 K and 570K (deep space environment), specific powers exceeding 10 We/kg are achievable using high performance segmented thermoelectric converters. The compact sizing and power density of the CPHS-RTG would constitute a significant step upgrade in specific power when compared to heritage GPHS-RTG (approximately5.1 We/kg) and off-the-shelf Multi-Mission RTG (approximately 2.6 We/kg)."

Yet, their early formation mechanisms are still not fully understood. To investigate the formation of tangential discontinuity (TD)-driven FBs and HFAs, we use 2-D local hybrid simulations where a reflected or an injected warm foreshock ion beam can interact with a TD whose half-thickness is comparable to the ion inertial scale. We show that the foreshock ions perform a partial gyration within, or across, the TD. Bulk motion differences between partially-gyrating foreshock ions and fluid-electrons lead to the generation of currents. As the trigger, these foreshock-driven currents change the magnetic field topology around the TD and force the frozen-in solar wind plasma to redistribute along with the field lines, shaping the foreshock transient. This confirms a recently proposed kinetic formation model. The extent of the magnetic field direction change across the TD within the foreshock ion gyromotion determines the current profile and thus the type of foreshock transient that forms. For a thin TD, the foreshock ions generate a current that is much stronger on the upstream side than the downstream side, forming an FB with one upstream compressional boundary. For the same foreshock ion gyroradius and magnetic shear, a thick TD yields comparable foreshock-driven currents on the upstream and downstream sides, forming an HFA with two compressional boundaries. Our study suggests that the TD thickness is one of the factors that determine the formation of FBs and HFAs"

This concept normalizes all terms for contingency, margin, growth allowance, and reserves to the amount that the basic mass of the vehicle could grow if each of those “room to grow” terms were released. The CABE metric is intended to provide a uniform indication of the total performance margin of a system at a given point in the project life cycle. The CABE metric can also provide a normalized means to trade the “room to grow” terms between various resources in order to solve system performance issues as they arise. For example, the CABE percentage for ISP margin could be equally traded with the CABE percentage for power margin."

A way to deal with this limitation is to declare the approach to landing a critical event, i.e., it must happen as planned or the entire mission is compromised. However,with the appropriate tools and techniques, a number of abort options can be identified, yielding a much more robust design. In this study, multi-body dynamics techniques are exploited to design abort trajectories for low energy transfers, using Earth’s Moon and Jupiter’s moon Europa as examples. As a result, periodic structures are identified for staging purposes in case of emergency, and the propellant cost associated with entering and departing these orbits prior to landing is evaluated."

Contamination transport models are based on established principles such as Fick’s law for contamination diffusion within the source material, Arrhenius factors to account for temperature variations and free molecular transport for spacecraft operating in vacuum. In addition to the science principles, empirical data obtained from ASTM E1559 testing is used for engineering contamination modeling. The ASTM E1559 test provides outgassing rate data for materials at expected spacecraft temperatures during a mission. Multiple quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) can be operated at different temperatures to measure the amount of contamination condensation that can occur on various spacecraft surfaces. At the conclusion of the ASTM E1559 test a thermo-gravimetric assessment (TGA) can be performed by heating the QCMs at a linear rate to obtain contamination desorption data. This TGA data provides a wealth of information that can be incorporated into contamination models. A method for applying this data is presented."

There are a substantial number of wheel skin cracks on the left front, left middle, and right middle wheels such that the number of grousers on each that are consideredat risk of breaking are 10, 7, and 11, respectively. Although the current level of wheel damage does not significantly limit Curiosity’s mission objectives, a higher damage rate could impact surface operations, so the damage rate is closely monitored. OnNovember 30, 2013, the MSL Surface Operations team began periodically acquiring images of Curiosity’s wheels.

While the approach is effective at managing risk and complexity, it can also be inefficient. Extended operations of the Mars2020 rover envisions a fundamentally different scheduling and execution approach. Atomic activities are constrained by mission operators in time, resource usage, and a structure of dependencies. The rover flight software will create and re-create schedules, responding to available energy, data volume, actual activity durations and execution status, observed temperatures, and other on-board state. Schedules are expected to change substantially in the course of execution. The solution space is prohibitively large and probabilistic in nature. A range of emergent behavior is accessible depending on the interaction between actual on-board state and a given formulation of constraints. For years, the specification and implementation of this capability have been considered and refined, as testing and analysis have mapped the contours of the system. Many concepts that could have been adopted were rejected, and in some cases, emergent properties have been exposed and beaten back with approaches to steer the behavior. This paper discusses some of the design history and underlying reasoning in the systems engineering of the first autonomous activity planner on Mars."

The 34m antennas of the Deep Space Network (DSN) have effective fields-of-view of approximately 1 milli-radians, hence predetermined pointing predicts with accuracies on the order of 1 milli-degree are required. The extremely accurate 1 nano-second timing distribution of the DSN network enables sub-meter level ranging in the radial direction, by measuring delays in phase-modulated pseudonoise (PN) echoes reflected from the target. In this paper we demonstrate experimental verification of the proposed techniques by post-processing radar reflections obtained from a decommissioned geo-synchronous satellite. The characteristics of correlation-based delay measurements obtained simultaneously with two different receiving antennas are described. These are the fundamental quantities used to form the “time difference of arrival” (TDOA) observables commonly used in GPS positioning algorithms, and the results interpreted in the context of hyperbolic position location that could be used in the future to monitor spacecraft in cis-lunar space."

Europa Lander is a proposed NASA mission concept to send a stationary spacecraft to Jupiter’s Icy Moon, Europa, to search for subsurface biosignatures. The Power Conversion Card is one of the many technologies designed for this mission. The Power Conversion Card’s primary function is to convert the power supplied by the spacecraft battery to usable power for use within the motor controller. In addition, this card provides power system telemetry to the spacecraft computer. This card tolerates Europa’s harsh radiation environment within a protected vault to enable it to survive the external temperatures which can be as low as -184°C during the three-week mission. This design makes use of multiple commercially available radiation hardened electronics, including Cobham’s UT32M0R500 Arm Microcontroller along with VPT’s DC-DC Converters for power conversion. The microcontroller is used to collect local power system telemetry and assess card health autonomously without intervention from the spacecraft’s main computer. This paper will showcase the design behind the prototype and electrical testing results."

The method is built around the use of a photo-realistic simulator, where a camera is deployed on a tracking spacecraft (ego) in order to observe an uncontrolled spacecraft (target) in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO). In this direction, the proposed approach performs the relative state (attitude and position) estimation of the target spacecraft using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The state estimation error is then modeled and the corresponding error-bounds are obtained around a nominal trajectory of the ego and target spacecraft. Next, this work proposes a linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) based approach to controller synthesis, guaranteed to be robust against both model uncertainties and measurement errors, resulting from vision-based estimation. This controller is comprised of two distinct components, one synthesized based on the nominal trajectory, while the “robust” component corrects for deviations from the nominal trajectory. Finally, a tracking scenario that directly utilize the image data for spacecraft guidance and control, is presented to showcase the performance of the proposed robust autonomy framework."

The sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to critical modelling and simulation parameters, including the fluid mechanical governing equations (Euler vs Navier-Stokes with RANS turbulence closure vs Navier-Stokes with LES turbulence closer), the interaction between the flow and the suspension lines (accounted for vs not accounted for), the dynamics of the payload (restrained vs free), and the material model of the heterogeneous fabric canopy (Saint-Venant Kirchoff vs mechanics-informed multiscale neural network), is extensively investigated. The parameter investigation is enabled by advancements to the state-of-the-art in the modelling and simulation of the supersonic parachute inflation process, which are presented as part of the computational framework. The predictive quality of the computational framework in the context of supersonic PID is validated by comparison of the simulation results with the experimental results from NASA’s Advanced Supersonic Parachute Research (ASPIRE) project. Through the validation, best practices for the modelling and simulation of supersonic PID are developed and proposed."

The spacecraft will perform a Mars Flyby in 2023 and enter (16) Psyche’s orbit in 2026. Throughout the mission, safely operating the spacecraft will require abiding by a set of flight rules that can be defined at any point in the mission lifecycle. These flight rules ensure that the spacecraft is operating within allowed regimes and a discrete event simulation tool, SEQGEN, will be used to model all command sequences prior to uplink. One of SEQGEN’s responsibilities is to determine if a command sequence violates any flight rules. For each flight rule, the necessary logic to determine if a violation has occurred is implemented in the SEQGEN adaptation, which is maintained by the mission. This adaptation must be tested thoroughly to ensure that the flight rule logic was interpreted and implemented correctly. This work describes a tool, RandSEQ, that autogenerates a suite of flight rule violating test sequences for each flight rule implemented in SEQGEN, and can be used by any mission using SEQGEN. The Psyche SEQGEN adaptation is still being developed, but so far, RandSEQ has been used to generate 532 test cases, that can be reviewed by various stakeholders, for 40 flight rules. The ability to autogenerate these test cases has significantly reduced the amount of time required to implement and test each flight rule."

The pointing performance of such telescopes tends to be driven by internal rather than external disturbances, in particular reaction wheel jitter. This paper considers an architecture that relies on microthrusters instead of reaction wheels for spacecraft fine pointing, focusing on the HabEx mission concept as a case study. The proposed implementation uses micro-Newton-class colloidal thrusters that were tested in orbit as part of the ST7 payload on the LISA Pathfinder mission to reach Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 7. Key characteristics of these thrusters and the associated system trade-offs are first discussed. The resulting pointing control loop design is then described. Its ability to meet applicable pointing requirements is shown using three-degree-of-freedom simulations, where relevant disturbances are modelled. The control system is shown to reduce the pointing error by several orders of magnitude in about two hours, starting from coarse reaction control system (RCS) handover conditions. Once settled, the system meets the steady-state milli-arcsecond-level performance requirements with significant margin. Overall, the results show that microthruster-based pointing control architectures offer a promising alternative to traditional reaction-wheel-based designs for space telescope applications."

Recently, a collaboration between The Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace) and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Labora- tory (JPL) investigated how Aerospace’s Trusted AI Frame- work could be applied to two JPL projects that planned on lev- eraging AI for critical autonomous tasks. This combined effort led to many insights in the practical implementation of trusted AI along with considerable updates to the Trusted AI Frame- work that tailored its topic threads to space exploration. This document cohesively summarizes the enhanced framework as tailored to space missions as well as estimation of the level of trust required as a function of mission criticality and key stakeholders. The goal of this work is to provide a set of best practices to inform autonomy researchers, flight engineers, mission and proposal reviewers, and instrument and mission principal investigators (PI’s) to drive AI-based autonomy that maximizes trust and lowers the barriers to mission adoption for both science and engineering applications."

Multiple commercial relay architectures were studied and evaluated for platform requirements, communications capabilities, and commercial business viability in a growing ecosystem. The evolution of communications needs around the Moon were mapped to infrastructure build out. Trade studies were performed to evaluate reliability and lifetime requirements, and the viability of various data protocols. Mission concepts and operations plans were developed for both initial mission support and future autonomous network support. This work has led to Lockheed Martin and JPL to evaluate a single dedicated relay satellite in a frozen lunar orbit, with simultaneous coverage of the far-side and south pole landing sites for over 10 hours per day as a first step towards a comprehensive solution to lunar connectivity. This first satellite is compatible with an ESPA Grande launch volume and would be capable of launching on a rideshare into a variety of orbits and trajectories. The satellite is equipped with both high- and low-rate communications relay payloads with software-defined radios and a delay/disruption tolerant networking protocol. The system is designed to service initial and future mission needs in a commercialized manner, enabling a new class of missions to the Moon. The relay satellite leverages prior spacecraft platform work with on-orbit heritage in a lunar environment expected by 2023."

Olivine is one of the most abundant and important minerals in the lunar mantle and mare basalts. Yet, no systematic olivine/melt partitioning data are available for lunar conditions. We report trace element partition data between host mineral olivine and its melt inclusions in lunar basalts. Equilibrium is evaluated using the Fe-Mg exchange coefficient, leading to the choice of melt inclusion-host olivine pairs in lunar basalts 12040, 12009, 15016, 15647, and 74235. Partition coefficients of 21 elements (Li, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Y, Zr, Nb, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu) were measured. Except for Li, V, and Cr, these elements show no significant difference in olivine-melt partitioning compared to the data for terrestrial samples. The partition coefficient of Li between olivine and melt in some lunar basalts with low Mg# (Mg# < 0.75 in olivine, or < ~0.5 in melt) is higher than published data for terrestrial * Corresponding author. Email address: youxue@umich.edu 2 samples, which is attributed to the dependence of DLi on Mg# and the lack of literature DLi data with low Mg#. The partition coefficient of V in lunar basalts is measured to be 0.17 to 0.74, significantly higher than that in terrestrial basalts (0.003 to 0.21), which can be explained by the lower oxygen fugacity in lunar basalts. The significantly higher DV can explain why V is less enriched in evolved lunar basalts than terrestrial basalts. The partition coefficient of Cr between olivine and basalt melt in the Moon is 0.11 to 0.62, which is lower than those in terrestrial settings by a factor of approximately 2. This is surprising because previous authors showed that Cr partition coefficient is independent of fO2. A quasi-thermodynamically based model is developed to correlate Cr partition coefficient to olivine and melt composition and fO2. The lower Cr partition coefficient between olivine and basalt in the Moon can lead to more Cr enrichment in the lunar magma ocean, as well as more Cr enrichment in mantle-derived basalts in the Moon. Hence, even though Cr is typically a compatible element in terrestrial basalts, it is moderately incompatible in primitive lunar basalts, with a similar degree of incompatibility as V based on partition coefficients in this work, as also evidenced by the relatively constant V/Cr ratio of 0.039 ± 0.011 in lunar basalts. The confirmation of constant V/Cr ratio is important for constraining concentrations of Cr (slightly volatile and siderophile) and V (slightly siderophile) in the bulk silicate Moon."

Previous studies have shown that the microbial composition of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome changes upon exposure to high linear energy transfer radiation. Interestingly, radiation-induced shifts in GI microbiota composition are linked to various neuropsychological disorders. Herein, we aimed to study changes in GI microbiota and behaviors of rats exposed to whole-body radiation (0, 5, or 25 cGy 4 He, 250 MeV/n) at approximately 6 months of age. Fecal samples were collected 24 hours prior to 4 He radiation and 24 hours and 7 days post-exposure for quantitative PCR analyses to assess fecal levels of spore-forming bacteria (SFB), Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia. Rats were also tested in the social odor recognition memory (SORM) test at 7 days following 4 He exposure. A subset of rats was euthanized 90 minutes following completion of the SORM test, and GI tissue from small intestine to colon were prepared for examining overall histological changes and immunohistochemical staining for serotonin (5-HT). No notable pathological changes were observed in GI tissues. Akkermansia spp. and SFB were significantly decreased the 25 cGy group at 24 hours and 7 days post-exposure compared to pre-exposure, respectively. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus spp. showed no significant changes. 5-HT production was significantly higher in the proximal small intestine and the cecum in the 25 cGy group compared to the sham group. The 25 cGy group exhibited deficits in recognition in SORM testing at 7 days post-exposure. Taken together, these results suggest a connection between GI microbiome 3 composition, serotonin production, and neurobehavioral performance, and that this connection may be disrupted upon exposure to 25 cGy of 4 He ions"

The Radiometric Calibration Network provides SI-traceable spectral top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from a network of ground sites and uses a look-up table (LUT) approach for uncertainty determination. The uncertainty LUT was derived using Monte Carlo techniques applied to the relevant solar geometry, surface, and atmospheric variables. While surface reflectance is typically the dominant uncertainty source, atmospheric contributions do play an important role, depending upon the exact scenario and conditions. This approach allows knowledge of TOA reflectance uncertainty to within 0.5%."

The experiments were performed using an updated and improved version of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) coupled general circulation model that includes two different versions for atmospheric composition: A non-interactive version (NINT) with prescribed composition and a tuned aerosol indirect effect and the One-Moment Aerosol model (OMA) version with fully interactive aerosols which includes a parameterized first indirect aerosol effect on clouds. The effective climate sensitivities are 3.0°C and 2.9°C for the NINT and OMA models, respectively. Each atmospheric version is coupled to two different ocean general circulation models: The GISS ocean model (E2.1-G) and HYCOM (E2.1-H). We describe the global mean responses for all future scenarios and spatial patterns of change for surface air temperature and precipitation for four of the marker scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP4-6.0, and SSP5-8.5. By 2100, global mean warming ranges from 1.5°C to 5.2°C relative to 1,850–1,880 mean temperature. Two high-mitigation scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 limit the surface warming to below 2°C by the end of the 21st century, except for the NINT E2.1-H model that simulates 2.2°C of surface warming. For the high emission scenario SSP5-8.5, the range is 4.6–5.2°C at 2100. Due to about 15% larger effective climate sensitivity and stronger transient climate response in both NINT and OMA CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5 versions, there is a stronger warming by 2100 in the SSP emission scenarios than in the comparable Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios in CMIP5. Changes in sea ice area are highly correlated to global mean surface air temperature anomalies and show steep declines in both hemispheres, with the largest sea ice area decreases occurring during September in the Northern Hemisphere in both E2.1-G (−1.21 × 106 km2/°C) and E2.1-H models (−0.94 × 106 km2/°C). Both coupled models project decreases in the Atlantic overturning stream function by 2100. The largest decrease of 56%–65% in the 21st century overturning stream function is produced in the warmest scenario SSP5-8.5 in the E2.1-G model, comparable to the reduction in the corresponding CMIP5 GISS-E2 RCP8.5 simulation. Both low-end scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 also simulate substantial reductions of the overturning (9%–37%) with slow recovery of about 10% by the end of the 21st century (relative to the maximum decrease at the middle of the 21st century)."

Hightemperatures, low relative humidity, and daytime southerly winds were all highly correlated withextreme rates of modeled spread. Fine fuels reached very dry levels, which accelerated simulationgrowth and heightened fire heat release (HR). Model sensitivity tests indicate that fire growth andHR are most sensitive to aridity and fuel moisture content.

Third, the rich specification language, type system, and powerful interactive prover of PVS can be used on dL objects. In addition to the embedding and verification of dL, a custom extension for Visual Studio Code has been developed, so that a stylized dL syntax can be used to specify hybrid programs and their properties."

Computer codes were developed to provide quantitative prediction, design, and analysis capability for several aircraft engine noise sources. The objective was to provide improved, physics-based tools for the exploration of noise-reduction concepts and the understanding of experimental results. Methods and codes focused on fan broadband and “buzz saw” noise and on low-emissions combustor noise and complement work done by other contractors under the NASA AST program to develop methods and codes for fan harmonic tone noise and jet noise. The methods and codes developed and reported herein employ a wide range of approaches, from the strictly empirical to the completely computational, with some being semiempirical, analytical, and/or analytical/computational. Emphasis was on capturing the essential physics while still considering method or code utility as a practical design and analysis tool for everyday engineering use. Codes and prediction models were developed for: (1) an improved empirical correlation model for fan rotor exit flow mean and turbulence properties, for use in predicting broadband noise generated by rotor exit flow turbulence interaction with downstream stator vanes; (2) fan broadband noise models for rotor and stator/turbulence interaction sources including  3D  effects,  noncompact-source effects,  directivity modeling, and extensions to the rotor supersonic tip-speed regime; (3) fan multiple-pure-tone in-duct sound pressure prediction methodology based on CFD analysis; and (4) low-emissions combustor prediction methodology and computer code based on CFD and actuator disk theory. In addition, the relative importance of dipole and quadrupole source mechanisms was studied using direct CFD source computation for a simple cascade/gust interaction problem, and an empirical combustor-noise correlation model was developed from engine acoustic test results. This work provided several insights on potential approaches to reducing aircraft engine noise. Code development is described in Volume I, and those insights are discussed.

Part 2 provides insight into the atmospheric circulation, boundary layer variability, three‐dimensional cloud structure, properties, and precipitation over the WNAO domain. Key results include spatial and seasonal differences in composition along the North American East Coast and over the WNAO associated with varying sources of smoke and dust and meteorological drivers such as temperature, moisture, and precipitation. Spatial and seasonal variations of tropospheric carbon monoxide and ozone highlight different pathways towards the accumulation of these species in the troposphere. Spatial distributions of speciated aerosol optical depth and vertical profiles of aerosol mass mixing ratios show a clear seasonal cycle highlighting the influence of different sources in addition to the impact of intercontinental transport. Analysis of long‐term climate model simulations of aerosol species and satellite observations of carbon monoxide confirm that there has been a significant decline in recent decades among anthropogenic constituents owing to regulatory activities."

system to demonstrate that high-efficiency electric propulsion can be integrated with aerodynamics to increase the performance of an airplane. To this end, distributed electric fans were installed on the wing to provide increased flow over the wing at the low takeoff and landing speeds of the X-57. The low-speed lift augmentation allows for a reduction in wing area for cruise optimization. The X-57 wing area was reduced to 42 percent of the wing area of the baseline aircraft, a Tecnam P2006T. With this reduced wing area and the electric propulsion system, it is estimated that the X-57 will cruise on less than one-third the total energy compared to the baseline aircraft. To meet the cruise performance goal at a Mach number of 0.233 at an altitude of 8000 feet, the X-57 has a cruise lift coefficient of 0.7516 and needs to have a cruise drag coefficient of 0.05423 or less. The USM3D computational solver was used to investigate the X-57 performance, without the distributed electric propulsion high-lift system operating. The unpowered X-57 performance is of interest to quantify if the X-57 can meet the cruise drag performance goal, and to document the lift performance of the very small wing at takeoff and landing conditions. The primary configurations investigated in this paper include the cruise configuration with no flap deflection, a takeoff configuration with a 10◦ flap deflection, and a landing configuration with a 30◦ flap deflection. The conditions for the cruise configuration were a flight unit Reynolds number of 1.32E+06 per foot, an altitude of 8000 feet, a Mach number of 0.233, and angles of attack from −2° to 24° . At the cruise lift coefficient of 0.7516, the computed drag coefficient is 0.05275. This computed drag is less than the drag coefficient of 0.05423 that is required to meet the X-57 airplane performance goal. However, the computational airplane is a completely smooth geometry and does not account for protuberance drag, nor the drag from steps and gaps in the actual X-57 airplane. Therefore, based upon the CFD drag calculation there is a 10-percent margin to account for some of the differences between the as-built metal fuselage and empennage construction, and the smooth computational geometry. The computed cruise drag also does not account for an induced drag reduction due to the wing-tip propellers and a drag reduction due to laminar flow achieved on the wing. The computed lift to drag ratio is 14.14 at the cruise lift coefficient of 0.7516, and the maximum computed lift to drag ratio is 15.8. The maximum lift coefficient for the cruise configuration was 2.13 at an angle of attack of 15°. The conditions for the takeoff configuration with a 10° flap deflection were a flight unit Reynolds number of 0.986E+06 per foot, an altitude of 2500 feet, a Mach number of 0.149, and angles of attack from −2° to 22°. The maximum lift coefficient for the takeoff configuration was 2.21 at an angle of attack of 16°. The conditions for the landing configuration with a 30° flap deflection were a flight unit Reynolds number of 0.922E+06 per foot, an altitude of 2500 feet, a Mach number of 0.139, and angles of attack from −2° to 24°. The maximum lift coefficient for the landing configuration was 2.58 and occurred at two angles of attack, 10° and 14°. Based on the unpowered maximum lift coefficient of 2.58 for the 30° flap deflection, along with computations of the distributed electric propulsion lift augmentation (not shown in this paper), the X-57 Maxwell is estimated to meet its powered landing goal of a maximum lift coefficient of 4.0."

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies have identified enigmatic planar defects in different occurrences of hibonite in the Allende meteorite that give rise to strong streaking along c* in electron diffraction patterns. Atomic resolution high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses were used to determine the nature and origin of these planar features. HAADF images of hibonite grains reveal lamellar intergrowths of common 1.6 nm spacing, and less commonly 2.0 and 2.5 nm spacings, interspersed in stoichiometric hibonite showing 1.1 nm (002) spacing. Stoichiometric hibonite consists of alternating Ca-containing (“R”) and spinel-structured (“S”) blocks stacked in a sequence RS. In contrast, the 1.6 nm layers result from a doubled S block such that the stacking sequence is RSS, while in the widest defect observed, the stacking sequence is RSSSS. These intergrowths are epitaxial and have coherent, low-strain boundaries with the host hibonite

Meteoritic hibonite shows common Ti and Mg substitution for Al in its structure. Atomic-resolution EDX maps of hibonite grains in the Allende CAI confirm the preferred site occupancy of Mg on tetragonal M3 sites in S blocks and of Ti on trigonal bipyramidal M2 and octahedral M4 sites in R blocks. Mg is highly concentrated, but Ti is absent in the planar defects where wider S blocks show Al-rich compositions compared to stoichiometric MgAl_2O_4 spinel. Therefore, Mg likely played the major role in the formation and metastability of planar defects in hibonite. Electron energy loss spectroscopy data from the Ti L_2,3 edge show the presence of mixed Ti oxidation states with ~ 15–20% of Ti as Ti^(3+) in hibonite, suggesting a direct substitution of Ti^(3+) ↔ Al^(3+) in hibonite. The remaining ~ 80–85% of Ti is present as Ti^(4+) and corresponding EDX analyses are consistent with the well-known coupled substitution 2Al^(3+) ↔ Ti^(4+) + Mg^(2+) being the major mechanism for Ti and Mg substitution in hibonite.

The formation of planar defects in hibonite occurred during high-temperature nebular condensation or melting/crystallization processes. The occurrence of non-stoichiometric hibonite in the Allende CAI deviates from the mineral formation sequence predicted from equilibrium condensation models. Overall, our atomic resolution TEM observations signify non-equilibrium, kinetic-controlled crystal growth during the high-temperature formation of refractory solids in the early solar nebula."

regenerative fuel cells (RFCs). Aerospace RFCs are likely to package proton exchange membrane electrochemical conversion devices based on hydrogen, oxygen, and water. To optimize system designs and direct further development, the most useful system metric is round-trip efficiency (RTE). Improving RTE generally increases specific energy and reduces system mass. The following analysis models the impact of several factors on RTE for RFCs scaling from 0.1 to 50 kW. The analysis demonstrates that higher electrolyzer (EZ) operational pressure most negatively impacts both RFC RTE and specific energy. Reactant storage heating and power management losses are significant for RFCs of any scale, but solenoid valve power becomes a noticeable parasitic load for smaller RFCs. Spherical gas storage vessels benefit RTE by only 2 to 4 percentage points but increase specific energy by ~50 percent. Cryogenic reactant storage is shown to depress RTE to below 15 percent in all cases. For a given RFC scale, there is an RTE benefit to specifying larger EZs and recharging at higher rates—if the RFC can be coupled with a corresponding power source. Although fuel cell (FC) operation is less impactful on RTE than EZ factors, efficiency is maximized by sizing the FCs relatively large and keeping current density low. RFC design is a balance of many interrelated factors, but this analysis provides a starting point for difficult decisions that must be made when designing a lunar equator RFC."

For this purpose, we evolve the ideal GRMHD equations on top of an approximated spacetime for the binary that is valid in every position of space, including the black hole horizons, during the inspiral regime. We use relaxed initial data for the circumbinary disk from a previous long-term simulation, where the accretion is dominated by an m = 1 overdensity called the lump. We compare our new spinning simulation with a previous non-spinning run, studying how spin influences the mini-disk properties. We analyze the accretion from the inner edge of the lump to the black hole, focusing on the angular momentum budget of the fluid around the mini-disks. We find that mini-disks in the spinning case have more mass over a cycle than the non-spinning case. However, in both cases we find most of the mass received by the black holes is delivered by direct plunging of material from the lump. We also analyze the morphology and variability of the electromagnetic fluxes and we find they share the same periodicities of the accretion rate. In the spinning case, we find that
the outflows are stronger than the non-spinning case. Our results will be useful to understand and produce realistic synthetic light curves and spectra, which can be used in future observations."

The first wind-tunnel entry included measurements of aerodynamic loads (tares) on the spinner without a rotor. The TTR has an onboard balance for direct measurement of rotor loads, so these tares comprise only spinner loads. Spinner tares also affect shaft loads measured independently of the balance. The results show that in axial flow, spinner drag is a linear function of dynamic pressure as expected, but at other flow angles, spinner loads include substantial lift and drag. Furthermore, there is a pronounced Magnus effect when the spinner is sideways to the flow. There is a sharp change in aerodynamic load at 90-deg yaw angle, indicating separation. Equations were developed to characterize the spinner tares at any arbitrary combination of yaw angle and airspeed."

The mixing field is captured using 100 kHz planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging of acetone as a tracer in the fuel supply, while 100 kHz chemiluminescence imaging of excited-state hydroxyl (OH*) radicals simultaneously resolves the evolution of the detonation wave. Time sequences are acquired over multiple detonation cycles in each test, with acetone-PLIF images collected along multiple orthogonal planes to reveal the complex three-dimensional topography of the fuel distribution. The instantaneous and phase averaged acetone-PLIF images enable measurement of key fuel injection characteristics, such as the injector recovery time, fuel jet velocity, and refill height for a range of operating conditions. Instantaneous and phase-averaged measurements of acetone-PLIF with the time-coincident OH* chemiluminescence images also reveal a number key features, such as fuel stratification and weak detonation in the injector near field, incomplete combustion and deflagration behind the detonation wave, vitiation and deflagration of reactants ahead of the detonation wave, and fuel and oxidizer recovery time mismatch leading to combustion inefficiency. These measurements significantly enhance the ability to obtain detailed information on the intracycle and intercycle spatiotemporal evolution of the reactant refill process and its coupled effects on the detonation wave structure and propagation."

The analysis of such materials is inherently complex due to the multiscale structure of these materials, and the dependence of macroscale behavior on changes that occur at lower scales. Previously, NASA’s Multiscale Analysis Tool (NASMAT) showed its capability in predicting unreinforced fabric behavior at the macroscale by capturing finite rotations that occur at the mesoscale. Though effective, the tool can face high computational cost for large, complex problems, motivating the need for the development of a surrogate model that can capture the same behavior. A recurrent neural network (RNN) was developed and trained on virtual NASMAT data to mimic the physics-based solutions while improving the computational runtime. The architecture of the RNN to best simulate the fabric behavior was carefully crafted based on heuristic knowledge of predicting physics-based temporal data, manual hyperparameter case studies, and Hyperband optimization.. The resultant model was able to predict a variety of stress-strain curves for fabrics with different mesoscale geometries, and was further validated by comparing to experimental data for the K706 style Kevlar plain-weave fabric, demonstrating the ability of the model to effectively capture the geometric changes in the fabric without explicitly calculating them, as is done in NASMAT. Furthermore, the tool showed its ability to improve on the runtime by a factor of 10 for fabric solutions compared to the multiscale tool, which would further enable the simulation of complex loading scenarios on unreinforced fabrics."

This methodology is particularly attractive for performing in-space transfer of cryogens due to the unknown location of the liquid/vapor interface in microgravity and the high likelihood of venting liquid if the vent valve is opened during transfer. This paper presents in-depth test data analysis of a Thermodynamic Vent System (TVS) augmented injector used for cryogenic tank chilldown and fill experiments of a thin-walled Titanium tank. Eight tests were conducted using liquid nitrogen across a range of inlet conditions and boundary conditions, and three different chilldown/fill methods. For four of the tests, the injector sprays liquid into the tank as normal, but also uses a TVS heat exchanger to cool the metallic injector itself as well as the main incoming liquid stream. Results show that using the TVS augmented injector simplifies transfer operation via enhanced condensation at the injector surface at the cost of sacrificing only a small amount of propellant."

experimentally through Pitot probe surveys. Numerical solutions were obtained through FUN3D (a 3-D
Unstructured Navier Stokes solver) for nine cases where the injector ‘jet Mach number’ ranged from
1.38 to 3.29 while the crossflow was maintained at a constant Mach number of 0.275. Four different
turbulence models were used in the numerical study: Spalart-Allmaras (SA), Shear-Stress-Transport
(SST), ‘SA-Neg’, and ‘SST-V’. At a low supersonic jet Mach number, the four turbulence models
produced similar results. At higher Mach numbers, only the SA produced a converged solution, however,
the numerically determined jet trajectories deviated noticeably from the experimental data as the injector
jet Mach number increased. The numerical and experimental results were compared to four empirical
formulae found in the literature. All four were inadequate in predicting the jet trajectories for the
operating conditions reported in this study. Two of the empirical formulae were modified to bring the
predictions within reasonable agreement with the experimental data."

This has driven missions to limit the generation of new and long-lived debris, control debris releases, minimize accidental explosions and collisions, and ensure Post-Mission Disposal of space systems, so that the environment remains safe for future operations and explorations. Given the continued need for space systems to support global mandatory infrastructure and commercial enterprise, spacefarers are extending beyond the Trilateral partners, more and smaller satellites are being deployed, and current assets are being utilized much longer than expected. This is making space more congested than ever; therefore, the Trilateral partners are evaluating potential future debris mitigation strategies, evolving technology, developing on-orbit servicing capabilities, and advancing their abilities to assess disposal and mission extension plans. They are also sharing their lessons learned and identifying opportunities for future state-of-the-art advancements for current and future space enterprises.

Sustaining the space environment cannot be ensured by any one agency or country. Thus, the Trilateral authors have shared their lessons learned, insights, and guidance, herein, on disposal and mission extension assessment strategies with the gratitude of each agency. As such, this document is not prescriptive, but was formulated to enhance value-and-risk-balanced operational decision-making, support policy refinement, and guide spacefaring partners beyond these agencies to assess their activities in space with safety and a global space-stewardship, or spacekeeping, in mind. This includes not only the disposal and mission extension assessment addressed herein, but also preserving space history, ensuring collaboration/interoperability of technology, supporting fellow operators without interfering, and the utilization of in-situ resources for the common benefit of humankind.

It is the intention of the Trilateral partners that this document evolves based on community lessons learned and the introduction of new assessment methodologies. So, all readers are encouraged to share their insights with the authors from their own application of this guidance or other strategies to ensure each mission has a successful, safe, and judicious life and conclusion."

We demonstrate an integrated approach to exploring these issues through the lens of a social-ecological system, combining remote and in-situ earth observations, hydrologic and climate models, and social surveys. Specifically, we examine how climate change and dam development could impact the Se Kong, Se San and Sre Pok rivers in the Mekong region. We find that climate change will lead to increased precipitation, necessitating a shift in dam operations, from maintaining low flows to reducing flood hazards. We also find that existing water governance systems in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are ill-prepared to address the problem. We conclude that the solution space for addressing these complex issues will be highly constrained unless major deficiencies in transboundary water governance, strategic planning, financial capacity, information sharing, and law enforcement are remedied in the next decades."

However,   the   abundances   of   magmatic volatiles within differentiated bodies are difficult to quantify,   and   they   are   often   depleted   by   varying degrees relative to CI chondrites. The mechanisms of depletion are not well constrained and could relate to intrinsic volatile depletion of the building blocks that formed  the  bodies,  high  temperature   processes  that result   from   accretion,   post-accretion   loss   through parent   body   geological   processes   and   large-scale impacts,   and/or   redistribution  within  a   parent   body through processes like core formation [1–4]. In   the   present   study,   we   aim   to   constrain   the abundances  of F, Cl, and H2O in eucrites to better understand the magnitude of volatile depletion on 4Vesta. To accomplish this objective, we report electron microprobe   analyses   of   apatite   from   seven unbrecciated, non-cumulate eucrites (i.e., CMS 04049,GRA 98098, LEW 88010, MAC 02522, MAC 041169,QUE 94484, and QUE 97053) and two monomict, non-cumulate eucrites (i.e., Berthoud and Stannern). In combination with previously published data on eucrite-hosted apatite, we determine Cl/F and H2O/F ratios in bulk rock eucrites through the application of apatite-based melt hygrometry and chlorometry [e.g., 5–7].Additionally, we estimate the bulk rock abundances of F in six non-cumulate eucrites (i.e., GRA 98098, MAC041169,   PCA   91078,   QUE   97053,   Stannern,   and Berthoud),   which   we   combine   with   previously published bulk rock F data on non-cumulate eucrites[8] to constrain the abundances of F, Cl, and H2O in 4Vesta   using   appropriately   paired   volatile/refractory element ratios for F, followed by Cl/F and H2O/F ratios for Cl and H2O, respectively."

We use the code Bothros to post-process data from 3D General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations via ray-tracing calculations. These simulations model the dynamics of a circumbinary disk and the mini-disks that form around two equal-mass black holes orbiting each other at an initial separation of 20 gravitational radii, and evolve the system for more than 10 orbits in the inspiral regime. We model the emission as the sum of thermal blackbody radiation emitted by an optically thick accretion disk and a power-law spectrum extending to hard X-rays emitted by a hot optically thin corona. We generate time-dependent spectra, images, and light curves at various frequencies to investigate intrinsic periodic signals in the emission, as well as the effects of the black hole spin. We find that prograde black hole spin makes mini-disks brighter since the smaller ISCO angular momentum demands more dissipation before matter plunges to the horizon. However, compared to mini-disks in larger separation binaries with spinning black holes, our mini-disks are less luminous: unlike those systems, their mass accretion rate is lower than in the circumbinary disk, and they radiate with lower efficiency because their inflow times are shorter. Compared to a single black hole system matched in
mass and accretion rate, these binaries have spectra noticeably weaker and softer in the UV. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the potential observability of these systems."

The data used to calibrate and evaluate three crop models were obtained from a field experiment with two irrigation amounts and two wheat cultivars that have different phenology and growth habit. After calibration, the model was applied to fifty locations across the wheat-growing area of the UK to cover all the main growing regions, with most points located in the main growing areas. Four GCMs, with two cultivars and five planting dates, were simulated at the end of the century. Results of this study showed that the UK potential wheat yield will increase by 2–8% under projected climate. Farmers will need to close such a gap in the future because it will have implications in terms of food security. Future climatic conditions might increase such a gap. Adaptation measures (e.g. moving the optimal planting time), along with climate-ready varieties bred for future conditions and with precision agriculture techniques can help to reduce this gap and ensure that the future actual UK wheat production will be close to the potential."

These climatic and ecological conditions are modulated by large-scale tropical-wide El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena. The aim of this 5-year study was to investigate climatic conditions during Rift Valley fever “post-epizootic” period in Free State province of the Republic of South Africa, which historically experienced the largest RVF outbreaks in this country. We collected satellite-derived rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data since 2014 to understand broad environmental conditions in the years following a period of sustained and widespread large RVF outbreaks (2008–2011) in the region. We found this post-epizootic/interepizootic period to be characterized by below-normal rainfall (~-500 mm), above LSTs (~+12°C), depressed NDVI (60% below normal), and severe drought as manifested particularly during the 2015–2016 growing season. Such conditions reduce the patchwork of appropriate habitats available for emergence of RVFV vectors and diminish chances of RVFV activity. However, the 2016–2017 growing season saw a marked return to somewhat wetter conditions without any reported RVFV transmission. In general, the aggregate vector collections during this 5-year period follow patterns observed in climate measurements. During the 2017–2018 growing season, late and seasonally above average rainfall resulted in a focal RVF outbreak in one location in the study region. This unanticipated event is an indicator of cryptic RVF activity during post-epizootic period and may be a harbinger of RVFV activity in the coming years."

If the spread is not controlled early, species can become well-established and increasingly difficult to manage. The National Park Service (NPS) Invasive Plant Management Teams (IPMTs) strive for an “early detection, rapid response” approach to reducing invasive species spread. Management teams can better prioritize their work with the help of species distribution models (SDMs), which map habitat suitability by combining species occurrences with environmental predictor variables. Scarce invaded range data for newly arrived invasive species presents a particular challenge for producing accurate models. To improve future modeling efforts, this project compared SDM methods using different spatial scales to model two plant species invasive to the Northeast US: the well-established Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) and newer invasive species wavyleaf basketgrass (Oplismenus undulatifolius). The team used NASA Earth observations and climate datasets to model occurrence data and predictor layers at a US-specific extent (90m2 spatial resolution) and global extent (1 km2 spatial resolution). Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) provided data for US Normalized Difference Moisture Indices (NDMI), while global NDMI and topographic predictor layers were derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The resulting models indicated important predictor variables for each species and explored the benefits and tradeoffs of using global data to model habitat suitability for new-arrival invasive species."

As a composite of Si and Al, we find that CE7 exhibits properties of both in ways that may be advantageous for this application. This exploration of the physical properties of CE7 reveals: (a) superconductivity below a critical transition temperature, T_c ∼ 1.2 K; (b) a thermal contraction profile much closer to Si than metal substrates; (c) the relatively low thermal conductivity anticipated for a superconductor, which can be improved by Au-plating; and (d) the feasibility of machining mechanical features with tolerances of ∼25 µm. We further discuss the use of CE7 in the cosmology large angular scale surveyor telescope array, which deployed CE7 in several of its detector focal planes."

We have searched infrared spectroscopic observations of Titan for signals from n-butane (n-C4H10) in Titan's stratosphere. Three sets of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer Focal Plane 4 (1050–1500 cm−1) observations were selected for modeling, having been collected from different flybys and pointing latitudes. We modeled the observations with the Nonlinear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral AnalySIS radiative transfer tool. Temperature profiles were retrieved for each of the data sets by modeling the ν4 emission from methane near 1305 cm−1. Then, incorporating the temperature profiles, we retrieved abundances of all of Titan's known trace gases that are active in this spectral region, reliably reproducing the observations. We then systematically tested a set of models with varying abundances of n-butane, investigating how the addition of this gas affected the fits. We did this for several different photochemically predicted abundance profiles from the literature, as well as for a constant-with-altitude profile. Ultimately, though we did not produce any firm detection of n-butane, we derived new upper limits on its abundance specific to the use of each profile and to multiple different ranges of stratospheric altitudes. These results will tightly constrain the C4 chemistry of future photochemical modeling of Titan's atmosphere and also motivate the continued search for n-butane and its isomer, isobutane."

This work was embedded into the interdisciplinary design of the five MOSAiC teams, studying the atmosphere, the sea ice, the ocean, the ecosystem and biogeochemical processes. The overall aim of the snow and sea ice observations during MOSAiC was to characterize the physical properties of the snow and ice cover comprehensively in the central Arctic over an entire annual cycle. This objective was achieved by detailed observations of physical properties, and of energy and mass balance of snow and ice. By studying snow and sea ice dynamics over nested spatial scales from centimeters to tens of kilometers, the variability across scales can be considered.  On-ice observations of in-situ and remote sensing properties of the different surface types over all seasons will help to improve numerical process and climate models, and to establish and validate novel satellite remote sensing methods; the linkages to   accompanying airborne measurements, satellite observations, and results of numerical  models are discussed. We found large spatial variabilities of snow metamorphism and thermal regimes impacting sea ice growth. We conclude that the highly variable snow cover needs to be considered in more detail (in observations, remote sensing and models) to better understand snow-related feedback processes. The ice pack revealed rapid transformations and motions along the drift in all seasons. The number of coupled ice-ocean interface processes observed in detail are expected to guide upcoming research with respect to the changing Arctic sea ice."

Non-uniformity in therain profile, however, tends to degrade the accuracy of the R and Dm estimates tosome extent as the range-independent assumption of the adjustable parameter () ofthe R-Dm relation is not able to fully account for natural variation of DSD in the verticalprofile. Underestimation of the DPR snow rate is found when compared with theindependent dual-frequency ratio (DFR) technique. This is possibly the result of theconstraint associated with the path integral attenuation (PIA)/differential PIA (dPIA)used in the DPR algorithm to find the best  and range-independent  assumption.

This work focuses on a selection of 22 γ-ray objects from the 2BIGB catalogue of high-synchrotron-peaked sources, which are classified as blazar candidates of uncertain type in the 4FGL-DR2 catalogue. We study these sources by means of a re-analysis of the first 10 yr of γ-ray data taken with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope, including the attenuation by the extragalactic background light. Their broad-band spectral energy distributions are also evaluated, using multiwavelength archival data in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands, in terms of one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton models, adding an external Compton component when needed. Out of this analysis, we identify 17 new extreme high-synchrotron-peaked (EHSP) candidates and compare their physical parameters with those of prototypical EHSP blazars. Finally, the resulting models are used to assess their detectability by the present and future generation of ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes.

Yet, one LIGO/Virgo observing run later, there has not yet been a second, secure identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. This is not surprising given that the localization uncertainties of events in LIGO and Virgo’s third observing run, O3, were much larger than predicted. We explain this by showing that improvements in data analysis that now allow LIGO/Virgo to detect weaker and hence more poorly localized events have increased the overall number of detections, of which well-localized, gold-plated events make up a smaller proportion overall. We present simulations of the next two LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, O4 and O5, that are grounded in the statistics ofO3 public alerts. To illustrate the significant impact that the updated predictions can have, we study the follow-up strategy for the Zwicky Transient Facility. Realistic and timely forecasting of gravitational-wave localization accuracy is paramount given the large commitments of telescope time and the need to prioritize which events are followed up.

This fleet of vehicles will enable examination of the sensitivity of UAM vehicle designs to technology assumptions, identify key research and development needs for UAM aircraft, and provide the UAM community with reference vehicles that are publicly available and based upon known assumptions. To date, five six-passenger UAM reference vehicles have been published: a single-main-rotor helicopter, a side-by-side helicopter, a quadrotor, a lift-plus-cruise, and a tiltwing. To increase the breadth of vehicle technologies encapsulated in the fleet of NASA UAM reference vehicles, this paper establishes a tiltduct vehicle as an addition to the fleet. The fleet will continue to evolve as future analyses and trade studies are performed.

The tiltduct UAM reference vehicle has six tilting ducted proprotors. This paper describes the initial configuration downselection; discusses ducted proprotor design rules of thumb as they applied to the conceptual design of the reference vehicle; describes the vehicle sizing, trade studies, and tuning of models performed; and finally, compares the resulting tiltduct vehicle against the other six-passenger NASA UAM reference vehicles. The high-level analyses performed for this study did not indicate significant differences in performance between the tiltduct and tiltwing reference vehicles, and so vehicle performance alone may not be a key driver in the selection of a tiltduct vehicle over a tiltwing vehicle. However, if ducts are found to have significant acoustical benefits, then acoustical priorities may provide a compelling reason to incorporate ducted proprotors.

One significant limitation of the design presented in this paper is that the ducted proprotor performance was tuned based upon performance characteristics observed during historical tests with disk loadings (defined as thrust divided by proprotor disk area) of 125-250 lb/ft$^2$. The tiltduct vehicle designed in this study has a disk loading of 30 lb/ft$^2$, to be more representative of UAM vehicles; further studies to understand performance of ducted proprotors at representative disk loadings are warranted."

Here we perform a holistic multivariate remote sensing analysis to simultaneously examine the primary components of the terrestrial water cycle from 2003 to 2020 and decipher the principal drivers of greening in HMA. We identified three drivers of greening: (1) precipitation drives greening in mid and low elevation areas covered by evergreen and mixed forests (e.g., Irrawaddy basin), (2) decreases in snow enhance greening in most of the hydrologic basins, and (3) irrigation induces greening in irrigated lands (Ganges-Brahmaputra and Indus)."

In addition to nominal flight control and mission operations, these 85+ experts per shift manage anomaly detection, diagnosis, and response, and support the crew in real-time in performing maintenance and repair, procedure execution, and other complex mission operations. Future long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs) beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) will not operate successfully using this same Human-Systems Integration Architecture (HSIA)  where crew rely on ground controllers, have ready access to resupply, and have a fallback plan of evacuation. As distance from Earth increases and the communication delay grows, crews will need to respond independently and adequately to time-critical vehicle malfunctions. It will not always be sufficient or even possible to ‘safe the system’ and then wait upon ground intervention. A new and radically different HSIA is needed to accommodate the paradigm shift of deep-space travel.
Historical International Space Station (ISS) data show that for a 30-day mission, the likelihood of a high-consequence vehicle anomaly of uncertain origin that requires rapid response is greater than 10%. The likelihood of such an event is 50% by the fourth month of the mission, and it grows exponentially with time. Our team has conducted in-depth investigations into these events and their corresponding anomaly resolution activities. Using MCC and Mission Evaluation Room (MER) anomaly resolution artifacts (including meeting summaries, caution and warning data, and ISS daily summaries), we created timelines detailing ground actions and in-orbit events for two significant anomalies. We then mapped these timelines onto Mars transit conditions, introducing a ground-crew communications time delay and shifting immediate response, time-critical task execution, and vehicle commanding to the crew. In detailing successful anomaly resolution in transit to Mars, the timelines highlight where effective resolution requires drastically evolved onboard capabilities. 
Though this research has yielded a rich data set based on ground response in past missions, there is still insufficient knowledge to assess the potential impact of inflight anomalies on a small autonomous crew on future LDEMs beyond LEO. To begin building an evidence base that will inform future HSIA standards and requirements, we are developing an approach to systematically capture crew anomaly response and procedure execution during early Artemis missions. Being the first human spaceflight beyond LEO since Apollo, early Artemis missions provide a rare and unique opportunity to serve as a testbed for Mars missions. Our work aims to capitalize on planned data collection to derive crew operational responses to anomalous events in real-time. Our team is also researching the level of simulation fidelity required for empirically validating proposed HSIA standards and evaluating HSIA implementations for LDEMs beyond LEO. This work will produce a trade space study of HSIA simulation objectives and fidelity requirements. Ultimately, these research efforts will assist in developing the standards and technologies needed to build a next-generation HSIA for LDEMs beyond LEO."

Initial particle analyses using field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry indicated that the particles were composed mainly of carbon. Prior to amino acid analysis, infrared and Raman microspectroscopy showed some grains possessed primitive organic carbon. Although trace terrestrial contamination, namely L-protein amino acids, was observed in all Hayabusa extracts, several terrestrially uncommon non-protein amino acids were also identified. Some Hayabusa particles contained racemic (D≈L) mixtures of the non-protein amino acids β-aminoisobutyric acid (β-AIB) and β-amino-n-butyric acid (β-ABA) at low abundances ranging from 0.09 to 0.31 nmol g<sup>−1</sup>. Larger abundances of the non-protein amino acid β-alanine (9.2 nmol g<sup>−1</sup>, ≈4.5 times greater than background levels) were measured in an extract of three Hayabusa particles. This β-alanine abundance was ≈6 times higher than that measured in an extract of a CM2 Murchison grain processed in parallel. The comparatively high β-alanine abundance is surprising as asteroid Itokawa is similar to amino acid-poor LL ordinary chondrites. Elevated β-alanine abundances and racemic β-AIB and β-ABA in Hayabusa grains suggested these compounds have non-biological and plausibly non-terrestrial origins. These results are the first evidence of plausibly extraterrestrial amino acids in asteroid material from a sample-return mission and demonstrate the capabilities of the analytical protocols used to study asteroid Ryugu and Bennu samples returned by the JAXA Hayabusa2 and NASA OSIRIS-REx missions, respectively."

Meteoroid and asteroid impacts can excavate large amounts of material from the surface and, above an airless body, can send this material long distances on (essentially) ballistic orbits.  This ejecta, while typically traveling slower than the impactor, can nevertheless achieve high enough speeds to endanger surface operations.  Accurate knowledge of this phenomenon is necessary in order to design appropriate shielding for human activities, both for activities on the surface of the Moon and for orbiters in near-lunar space.  This phenomenon is also important in the transport of particles above other Solar System objects, such as Jovian satellites, where this ejecta creates a kind of ever-present “halo” of particles around the gravitating body.  While Monte Carlo techniques have been successfully used to model this environment, there are useful analytic expressions, developed for use in modeling the meteoroid environment, that can be used to describe this environment as well.  Such analytic tools can shed light on the altitude, velocity, and directionality of these ejecta environments."

Titan, a “world with two oceans”, is an organic-rich body with interior-surface-atmosphere interactions that are comparable in complexity to the Earth. Titan is also one of the few places in the Solar System with habitability potential. Titan’s remarkable nature was only partly revealed by the Cassini-Huygens mission and still holds mysteries requiring a complete exploration using a variety of vehicles and instruments. The proposed mission concept POSEI-DON  (Titan  POlar  Scout/orbitEr  and  In  situ  lake  lander  DrONe  explorer)  would  perform joint orbital and in situ investigations of Titan. It is designed to build on and exceed the scope and scientific/technological accomplishments of Cassini-Huygens, exploring Titan in ways that were not previously possible, in particular through full close-up  and  in  situ  coverage  over  long  periods  of  time.  In  the  proposed  mission  architecture, POSEIDON consists of two major elements: a spacecraft with a large set of instruments that would orbit Titan, preferably in a low-eccentricity polar orbit, and  a  suite  of  in  situ  investigation  components,  i.e.  a  lake  lander,  a  “heavy”  drone  (possibly amphibious) and/or a fleet of mini-drones, dedicated to the exploration of the  polar  regions.  The  ideal  arrival  time  at  Titan  would  be  slightly  before  the  next  northern Spring equinox (2039), as equinoxes are the most active periods to moni-tor still largely unknown atmospheric and surface seasonal changes. The exploration of Titan’s northern latitudes with an orbiter and in situ element(s) would be highly complementary in terms of timing (with possible mission timing overlap), locations, and science goals with the upcoming NASA New Frontiers Dragonfly mission that will provide in situ exploration of Titan’s equatorial regions, in the mid-2030s."

The US oil and gas sector is extensive in scale, critical to fulfilling US energy needs, and deals with commodities presenting enormous challenges for personnel safety and the environment. Thus, it is imperative that they have accurate and responsive sensors to detect hazardous gases such as methane.

US space launch systems will increasingly also use liquefied methane and liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is mostly methane, in quantities large and small, as main and auxiliary propulsion and power. Some of these systems will be reusable, which adds the unique challenge of processing a vehicle that has residual commodities and has returned to its launch site to be readied for its next launch. 

The methane sensors test and evaluation project (M-STEP) began within the context of a reusable launch system, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Experimental Spaceplane (XSP) program, which would have employed a high-pressure gaseous methane and gaseous oxygen reaction control system.

Our aim is to assess whether exposure of cultured human cardiomyocytes to hypergravity can induce changes in chromatin organization as assayed by Hi-C proximity ligation technique. Hi-C is used to analyze chromatin interactions by using formaldehyde to crosslink regions of chromatin that are in close proximity. The DNA is then fragmented using a restriction enzyme and ligated under dilute conditions to favor intramolecular ligation of cross-linked fragments. Finally, the DNA is sequenced, allowing reconstruction of genomic structure. iCell cardiomyocyte cultures will be exposed to 40 g via an engineered device (incu-fuge) that allows for the chemical fixation of cells on a spinning centrifuge. Additionally, we plan on using fluorescence microscopy to analyze the nuclear and actin cytoskeletal conformation of cardiomyocytes post hypergravity exposure. We hypothesize that chromatin will rearrange in hypergravity conditions, both rapidly due to direct mechanical forces, as well as over longer time frames due to changes to structures necessary for transcriptional responses such as the de novo formation of promoter-enhancer loops. A negative result–no change between 1 g and hypergravity conditions–would nevertheless be an important data point in our understanding of the rheology of the nucleus, and how cells and cellular structures respond to different gravity fields. The cellular physiology of hypergravity has clinical relevance for spaceflight, and can further inform our understanding of microgravity physiology."

A basis function method for linear as well as geometrically nonlinear structural shape sensing is proposed in this study. Basis functions can be mode shapes, linear static deformation shapes, or geometrically nonlinear static deformation shapes. The proposed basis function method is validated using a high-aspect-ratio wing, a swept test plate, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Low Boom Flight Demonstration mission X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) aircraft (Lockheed Martin, Bethesda, Maryland). A large structural deformation of a high-aspect-ratio wing is successfully captured using the proposed basis function method with less than 0.3-percentprediction error at the wing-tip section. The basis function method gives excellent deformation prediction, even with stress concentration. Performance of the basis functions is compared using the X-59 stabilator sample case. In most of the sample load cases, static deformations give a better correlation with the target deformation than do mode shapes. Wing shape sensing with sparse strain data is also demonstrated in this study using the X-59 QueSST aircraft. Predicted structural deformations match reasonably with the target deformations even without strain gauges on some structural components. The predicted deformations have a good match with the target deformations."

COSPAR (The Committee on Space Research), together with participating space agencies, has over the last several years organized and held interdisciplinary meetings to consider next steps in addressing knowledge gaps for planetary protection for the first human missions to Mars. Beginning with these workshop discussions as a base, NASA has held follow-on planning activities to identify the necessary steps to be accomplished to close those knowledge gaps. Significant overlap was identified between the planetary protection needs, including; microbial monitoring requirements for crew health and medical systems; studies of the microbiome of the built environment; environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) venting and disinfection strategies; waste management, and; planetary surface operations. In many cases, efforts to mature exploration systems for Mars that are occurring in other technology domains can be leveraged with minor changes to address planetary protection gaps as well. In other cases, work planned for testing on ISS as an analog for Mars transit, or on the lunar surface as an analog for Mars surface operations, can be used to close gaps in current planetary protection capabilities.

However, contemporary MnO2 and polymer tantalum capacitors have both infant mortality (IM) and wear-out (WO) failures. This requires assessments of the useful life of the parts that is limited by the time of inception of WO failures that can be determined using an adequate reliability model and results of highly accelerated life testing (HALT). In this presentation, a modified time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) model is used to describe both IM and WO failures during HALT. Specifics of physical processes resulting in degradation and failures in polymer and MnO2 tantalum capacitors are discussed, and the increase of IM failures with the level of stress is explained. The model justifies exponential dependence of the acceleration factors on voltage and predicts higher values of the voltage acceleration constant for IM compared to WO failures."

what conditions a relevant variability in background aerosol concentrations may have a significant dynamical impact on convective
clouds and their associated precipitation. Furthermore, current climate models must parameterize both the microphysical
and the cumulus convection processes, but this is usually implemented separately, whereas in nature there is a strong coupling
between them. As a first step to improve our understanding of these two problems, we investigate how aerosol concentrations
modify key properties of updrafts in eight large-eddy permitting regional simulations of a case study of scattered convection
over Houston, Texas, in which convection is explicitly simulated and microphysical processes are parameterized. Dynamical
and liquid-phase microphysical responses are investigated using two different reference frames: static cloudy-updraft grid
cells versus tracked cumulus thermals. In both frameworks we observe the expected microphysical responses to higher aerosol
concentrations, such as higher cloud number concentrations and lower rain number concentrations. In terms of the dynamical
responses, both frameworks indicate weak impacts of varying aerosol concentrations relative to the noise between simulations
over the observationally derived range of aerosol variability for this case study. On the other hand, results suggest that thermals
are more selective than cloudy-updraft grid cells in terms of sampling the most active convective air masses. For instance,
vertical velocity from thermals is significantly higher at upper levels than when sampled from cloudy-updraft grid points,
and several microphysical variables have higher average values in the cumulus thermal framework than in the cloudy-updraft
framework. In addition, the thermal analysis is seen to add rich quantitative information about the rates and covariability of
microphysical processes spatially and throughout tracked thermal lifecycles, which can serve as a stronger foundation for
improving subgrid-scale parameterizations."

Previous evaluation efforts have identified bias dependence on precipitation regime, which may reflect the influence on retrievals of recurring factors. In this study, the concept of a regime-based evaluation of precipitation from the Goddard profiling (GPROF) algorithm is extended to cloud regimes. Specifically, GPROF V05 precipitation retrievals under four different cloud regimes are evaluated against ground radars over the United States. GPROF is generally able to accurately retrieve the precipitation associated with both organized convection and less organized storms, which collectively produce a substantial fraction of global precipitation. However, precipitation from stratocumulus systems is underestimated over land and overestimated over water. Similarly, precipitation associated with trade cumulus environments is underestimated over land, while biases over water depend on the sensor’s channel configuration. By extending the evaluation to more sensors and suppressed environments, these results complement insights previously obtained from precipitation regimes, thus demonstrating the potential of cloud regimes in categorizing the global atmosphere into discrete systems."

A majority of Sun-like stars, such as the A and B components of Alpha Centauri, have at least one stellar companion that can introduce additional noise into the field of view of any high-contrast imaging instrument. Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC) is a wavefront-control technique that removes stellar leakage from both stellar components, enabling direct imaging of planets in many binary star systems.

We present the latest experimental and modeling results obtained with MSWC as part of the technology development effort focusing on demonstrations conducted on the Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed at JPL. OMC has a layout similar to the Roman Space Telescope coronagraph instrument (CGI), and we used a MSWC mask similar to the one that was contributed to the Roman CGI. Our results represent the first demonstrations of this technique on the OMC testbed, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating full MSWC with validated models at contrast levels relevant to Roman CGI.

Technical Review Abstract:
A majority of Sun-like stars have at least one stellar companion that can introduce additional noise into the field of view of any high-contrast imaging instrument, limiting the achievable contrast. These include high-quality target stars such as the A and B components of Alpha Centauri, our nearest stellar neighbor. Enabling direct imaging of binary stars has the potential to increase the scientific yield for coronagraphic instruments planned on NASA's future space missions including the Roman Space Telescope and the next IR/O/UV Flagship recommended by Astro2020. Multi-Star Wavefront Control (MSWC) is a wavefront-control technique that simultaneously removes the (mutually incoherent) stellar leakage from both stellar components, enabling direct imaging of planets in many binary star systems. MSWC is an algorithmic technique and can be used with existing wavefront control systems on coronagraphic instruments (as well as starshades if a deformable mirror is available in the optical path). 

We summarize the latest experimental and numerical results obtained with MSWC as part of the technology development effort to demonstrate compatibility with existing high-contrast imaging platforms for this technique. The Super-Nyquist regime of MSWC was tested in vacuum at JPL's High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) on the Decadal Survey Testbed (DST) reaching 8.6e-9 contrast in a 10% band. Recently, the Occulting Mask Coronagraph (OMC) testbed at JPL is being prepared for demonstrations of Multi-Star Wavefront Control. A shaped pupil mask similar to the contributed MSWC mask on the Roman Space Telescope's coronagraph instrument has been recently manufactured including matching Lyot and focal plane masks and being installed on the OMC testbed. The goal of this experiment is a demonstration of MSWC using validated models on a testbed configuration and at contrast levels relevant to the Roman coronagraphic instrument."

In this study, a sufficiently large plate of Al 2219 was not available for the fabrication of a FPVBH.  Therefore, the forming blank comprised two plates (from different lots) butt welded together using a single friction stir weld.  The welded forming blank was then spin formed into the FPVBH configuration and heat treated to the T62 temper.  Mechanical property testing of the spin-formed 2219-T62 FPVBH revealed that the tensile properties were comparable to the Metallic Material Properties Development and Standardization (MMPDS) A-basis allowable for Al 2219-T6 wrought products. However, post-spin forming application of the standard heat treatment produced large, recrystallized grains in the material.  The response varied within the two plates; one plate lot exhibited nearly complete recrystallization, while the other lot contained bands of recrystallization.

Although no reduction in tensile properties was observed due to these microstructural variations, a more detailed investigation was recommended to better understand the effect of spin forming on the recrystallization mechanism and the impact on other material properties.  The current study examined the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fully processed Al 2219-T62 FPVBH with emphasis on comparing differences between the two plates. Testing was limited to the cone region of the FPVBH.  The two specific tasks in this study were:
a)	Characterization of the microstructure and mechanical properties in the two plates used in the FPVBH.
b)	Isolation of the impact of each step in the thermo-mechanical processing (TMP) sequence of the FPVBH on recrystallization and grain growth.

Mechanical property testing sampled regions containing both large, recrystallized and small, unrecrystallized grains.  Tensile strengths and elongations were equivalent in both regions and exceeded MMPDS A-basis allowables. Fracture toughness was equivalent in both regions and fracture morphology was typical of aluminum alloys.  The fatigue precrack region of the fracture toughness specimens appeared more faceted in the recrystallized plate. This suggests that property testing that is more sensitive to grain size, such as fatigue crack growth rate and stress corrosion cracking, may be warranted.

Alcoa reviewed the production records for the two plate lots and confirmed that composition of both plates was within the allowable range for Al 2219 and that plate processing steps were all performed within production limits. However, the Fe content was notably higher in the fully recrystallized plate, resulting in a greater volume fraction of large Fe-bearing inclusions and Al-Cu constituent particles. Alcoa did not provide details regarding plate processing variables for the two plate lots.

It was surmised that deformation by hot rolling was the most accurate TMP simulation of commercial spin forming within a laboratory setting. Both hot rolling and spin forming comprise combinations of shear and compressive deformation. The through-thickness strain caused by hot rolling is symmetrical about the mid-plane, as the rollers contact both sides of the material. Shear strains are maximum at the inner and outer surfaces and trend toward zero at the mid-thickness. In contrast, spin forming utilizes a single roller on the outer surface, producing a gradient in shear stress through the thickness. Shear strains in spin-formed material are highest at the outer surface due to direct contact with the roller, and trend toward zero at the inner surface. Consequently, there will undoubtedly be some discrepancies in the mechanical response of hot-rolled and spin-formed products in the through-thickness direction.

Interrupted TMP simulations were performed on remnant plate from the FPVBH forming blank in order to isolate the effects of a post-weld anneal, spin-forming deformation/thermal cycling, and solution heat treatment (SHT) on development of the recrystallized microstructures. Analysis confirmed that large, recrystallized grains formed exclusively during SHT and only after a certain deformation level was exceeded. Remnant plate from both lots that received thermal processing only did not exhibit recrystallization but exhibited fully recrystallized microstructures when processed by hot rolling.  This indicates that (1) the level of deformation exceeded the critical level for recrystallization in both plates and (2) that the level of deformation during hot rolling was greater than that which accumulated during spin forming of the FPVBH.  Comparison of the hot-rolled plate with the spin-formed material showed that the recrystallized grain size was larger in the FPVBH, providing further evidence that deformation levels were lower in the FPVBH.

The most plausible explanation for the differing degrees of recrystallization in the two plates is particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) at the Fe-bearing inclusions and large Al-Cu constituent particles.  In the plate with higher solute content, the greater volume fraction of these particles reduces the deformation level required to promote recrystallization.  During spin forming the critical deformation level was likely exceeded for the higher Fe content plate resulting in a fully recrystallized microstructure.  The lower Fe content plate developed a microstructure that exhibited bands of recrystallization due to the combination of a non-uniform distribution of particles and deformation.  The critical deformation required for recrystallization was likely only exceeded during spin forming in regions of higher particle content.

While there were differences in Fe content between these lots of Al 2219 plate, the composition of both was within defined alloy limits and Alcoa reported no anomalies during plate production. The observed differences in recrystallization after spin forming may reflect the inherent variability between these two lots of plate. The spin-forming vendor, Spincraft, reported that similar variations in recrystallized microstructures have been observed during examination of multiple spin-forming trials of a different 2xxx series aluminum alloy. Hence, tighter chemical specification limits on impurity levels in Al 2219 plate may help ensure uniform, predictable microstructures. Finally, the tensile and fracture toughness properties were not affected by the microstructural variations noted."

Three one-way UA voice delay lengths of 400, 900, and 2,000 milliseconds (ms) were tested, representing the currently estimated transmission delays for terrestrial, satellite communication (SATCOM), and long SATCOM Command and Control Link System, respectively. All delay values exceeded 390 ms, the FAA’s current requirement for the maximum communication latency in the National Airspace System. Eight retired en route air traffic controllers (ATCs) and eight remote pilots (RPs) participated in a human-in-the-loop simulation study, where a simulated UA flight transitioned through an Oakland en route low-altitude sector to a local non-towered airport. The results showed that, when the 2,000-ms voice delay was present, radio transmission step-ons and detect-and-avoid (DAA) alert level elevations increased. In addition, ATC workload, ATC acceptability for the UA, and RP acceptability for the DAA were negatively affected only when the UA had a 2,000-ms voice delay under the high traffic-volume condition, but not in the other conditions."

In 2021, amidst a decades-long drought, an extensive juniper mortality event occurred at Wupatki National Monument (WNM) in Arizona. In response, the National Park Service (NPS) is evaluating which land management practices will be beneficial. In partnership with the NPS, the NASA DEVELOP team used remote sensing data to map PJW mortality and analyze the relation of tree mortality to stand density, climate, and topography in north-central Arizona from 2015 to 2021. To identify the extent of PJW, the team performed an unsupervised classification using National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data with validation sources including NPS-created land cover maps, Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE), NPS and United States Forest Service (USFS) vegetation maps, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data. Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Landsat 8-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) were used to analyze factors contributing to pinyon-juniper mortality. Although no relationships were found in the broader study region, PJW mortality was weakly correlated to elevation, soil moisture, and land surface temperature within WNM. Results from this study can inform NPS vegetation management that best protects natural and cultural resources."

Remote sensing is a tool increasingly used to estimate the spatial heterogeneity, extent and change of carbon stocks within and across various systems. We designate the use of the term wet carbon system to the interconnected wetlands, ocean, river and streams, lakes and ponds, and permafrost, which are carbon-dense and vital conduits for carbon throughout the terrestrial and aquatic sections of the carbon cycle. We reviewed wet carbon monitoring studies that utilize earth observation to improve our knowledge of data gaps, methods, and future research recommendations. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review collecting 1,622 references and screening them with a combination of text matching and a panel of three experts. The search found 496 references, with an additional 78 references added by experts. Our study found considerable variability of the utilization of remote sensing and global wet carbon monitoring progress across the nine systems analyzed. The review highlighted that remote sensing is routinely used to globally map carbon in mangroves and oceans, whereas seagrass, terrestrial wetlands, tidal marshes, rivers, and permafrost would benefit from more accurate and comprehensive global maps of extent. We identified three critical gaps and twelve recommendations to continue progressing wet carbon systems and increase cross system scientific inquiry."

Of particular interest are schemes where a small number of pilots operate a large number of vehicles, mitigating high cost and pilot shortage issues. Such architectures require increased levels of automation and supervisory control modes. They also require ensuring safe operations when the command and control link to the vehicle is degraded or lost completely, rendering the vehicle autonomous.  To evaluate these variable and dynamic architectures, this paper will present a framework for decomposing the functions necessary to ensure safe, orderly, and expeditious air travel, assessing the agents in the system, and classifying the levels of autonomy. Then, an example allocation to agents of roles for the function of separation assurance is presented, highlighting the dependency of the allocation on three main factors&#58; time criticality of a potential separation violation, the ratio of pilots to vehicles, and the loss of the command and control link."

However, this initially downstream movement slows down and ultimately reverses beyond a critical value of the nose radius, and may be related to external forcing in the form of freestream disturbances and/or surface roughness. To understand the effects of freestream acoustic disturbances on transition reversal over a blunt body, hypersonic boundary-layer receptivity to broadband freestream acoustic disturbances from the nozzle wall of a digital conventional wind tunnel is investigated by both direct numerical simulations (DNS) and modal and nonmodal stability analysis. A Mach 8 flow over a 7 deg half-angle cone with a nose radius of 𝑅<sub><i>𝑛</i></sub> = 5.2mm and freestream Reynolds number of 12.2 × 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>-1</sup> is considered. The results show that the broadband tunnel noise in the free stream of a convectional hypersonic wind tunnel (i.e., outside of the nozzle-wall turbulent boundary layer) can be well represented by an acoustic model with an ansatz of slow acoustic waves. With successful calibration of the model parameters against the precursor tunnel DNS, such an acoustic ansatz can successfully reproduce both the frequency-wavenumber spectra and the temporal evolution of the broadband tunnel noise radiated from the nozzle wall. Additionally, the DNS of the Mach 8 blunt cone with tunnel-like acoustic input above the bow shock showed that the spectra of wall-pressure and heat-transfer fluctuations recovers the signature of the axisymmetric waves predicted by the nonmodal analysis. Furthermore, the azimuthal wavenumber and frequency spectrum of the temperature fluctuations as a function of the wall-normal distance show higher amplitudes for three-dimensional waves above the boundary-layer edge. The numerical schlieren contours show the inclined structures commonly observed in blunt cone experiments, demonstrating that they correspond to three-dimensional structures due to freestream disturbances in the presence of an entropy layer."

Key enablers in this exploration are rover systems intended to operate in both the lunar and Mars surface environments. This study focused primarily on the Mars surface environment because, compared to the near-continuous illumination near the lunar poles, the day/night cycles and the reduced solar illumination on Mars make it much more difficult to use solar power. However, solar power is not the only power generation technology available. 
Top-level energy studies have shown that a radioisotope power system (RPS) has promise for supplying both power and thermal energy for crewed rovers on both the Moon and Mars. This design study investigates how an RPS could potentially meet the power and thermal needs of a pressurized rover with applications for both destinations. The design focus is on what service an RPS can provide and how it would be integrated into a rover (power and thermal interfaces, placement, radiation shielding, fairing installation on the pad, etc.)."

NO2 is a growing threat to national parks within the Delaware Basin where nearby oil and gas activity contributes to deteriorating park conditions, implying adverse effects on the local tourism economy and public health. To demonstrate spatial and temporal patterns of air pollution in the parks, we examined average monthly, seasonal, and annual tropospheric column concentrations of NO2 in Carlsbad Caverns (CAVE) and Guadalupe Mountain (GUMO) National Parks. We used both the NASA Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to map NO2 tropospheric column densities. Using ground-based emissions values from the Environmental Protection Agency National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for two nearby natural gas processing plants (Indian Basin Gas Plant, South Carlsbad Plant), we extrapolated monthly trends from these point sources and compared seasonal emissions levels with the measurements recorded by OMI and TROPOMI. The NEI data show an 8% increase in flaring from 2013–2021. OMI measured a 38.3% NO2 increase over the Delaware Basin, 15.29% increase over CAVE, and 4.26% decrease over GUMO from 2011–2018. TROPOMI measured a -1% NO2 change over the Delaware Basin, 3% over CAVE, and 7% over GUMO from 2018–2020. The analysis indicates a positive correlation between emissions from fossil fuel exploration and NO2 concentrations above CAVE and GUMO. This information will inform National Park Service air quality monitoring and policy efforts to ensure compliance with the Clean Air Act."

To address this bias, an evaluation dataset was compiled using eddy covariance data from 40 sites between latitudes 30° S and 30° N. The flux data were obtained from the emerging network in Mexico (MexFlux) and from openly available databases of FLUXNET, AsiaFlux, and OzFlux. This unique reference dataset was then used to evaluate remote sensing-based ET products in environments that have been underrepresented in earlier studies. The evaluated products were: MODIS ET (MOD16, both the discontinued collection 5 (C5) and the latest collection (C6)), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) ET, and Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) ET. Products were compared with unadjusted fluxes (ETorig) and with fluxes corrected for the lack of energy balance closure (ETebc). Three common statistical metrics were used: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). The effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on product evaluation results was investigated by examining the relationship between the statistical metrics and product-specific vegetation match indexes. Evaluation results of this study and those published in the literature were used to examine the performance of the products across latitudes. Differences between the MOD16 collection 5 and 6 datasets were generally smaller than differences with the other products. Performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether ETorig or ETebc was used. When using ETorig, GLEAM generally had the highest R2, smallest PBIAS, and best RMSE values across the studied land cover types and climate zones. Neither MOD16 nor ALEXI performed consistently better than the other. When using ETebc, none of the products stood out in terms of both low bias and strong correlations. The use of ETebc instead of ETorig affected the biases more than the correlations. The product evaluation results showed no significant relationship with the degree of match between the vegetation at the pixel and site scale. The latitudinal comparison showed tendencies of lower R2 (all products) but better PBIAS and normalized RMSE values (MOD16 and GLEAM) for forests at low latitudes than for forests at northern middle latitudes. For non-forest vegetation, the products showed no clear latitudinal differences in performance."

Microorganisms traveling to space experience stress from environmental features such as ionizing radiation and lack of normal gravity, and much remains unknown about the mechanisms by which those environmental features affect microbial physiology. Microbes experience changes in gravity not directly but rather through changes in their fluid environment, and deep-space particle radiation causes cell damage that is complex but rare. Computational modeling at the single-cell level (agent-based modeling) can allow us to probe the spatially heterogeneous processes that characterize space stresses, to gain insight into the relationships of microbial cells with their environments and with each other. Here we present two software packages for simulating microbial population dynamics in space conditions: CAMDLES and AMMPER.

Microbes growing in liquid culture medium in the microgravity of an orbital space station experience a quiescent, poorly-mixed fluid environment. CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation) simultaneously simulates biological, chemical, and mechanical processes to predict microbial ecological dynamics in microgravity, and in the rotating culture vessels used to create an artificial microgravity environment in the lab. Initial results demonstrate that the growth of a cross-feeding microbial consortium, dependent on the exchange of soluble metabolites, is sensitive to the initial spatial distribution of cells, and grows differently in real versus artificial microgravity.

Microbial populations exposed to deep-space radiation experience spatially and temporally heterogeneous damage from the traversal of high-energy particles. AMMPER (Agent-Based Model for Microbial Populations Exposed to Radiation) pairs a 3d model of energy deposition along a radiation particle track with a microbial population growth and damage model to predict the effects of localized radiation damage on population-level responses. It includes a user-friendly graphical interface. AMMPER growth curves recapitulate experimental results, and allow comparison between direct effects (DNA damage) and indirect effects (reactive oxygen species generation, metabolic impairment) of radiation."

Previous studies on aqueously altered CM, CY and CR chondrites have shown that the noble gases preserved in those meteorites can be used to assess the extent of parent body processing. This is mostly due to an Ar-rich carrier phase being susceptible to aqueous alteration. In this study, we follow up on these findings by investigating the effects of mild thermal alteration on the noble gas content of CO chondrites. They are subclassified from petrologic subtype 3.0 (e.g., Yamato-81025) to 3.8 (e.g., Isna) according to the degree of thermal alteration experienced. Understanding these effects does not only help to distinguish the most primitive samples from the severely altered ones, but also adds to the picture of the primordial volatile composition and distribution, as preserved in the most primitive material which accreted from the solar nebula at different heliocentric distances. Additionally, we search for pairing among samples, as part of an ongoing survey of Antarctic CO chondrites.

**Experimental:** Noble gas measurements were conducted on aliquots of ~20-25 mg from 16 different samples of varying petrologic subtype from 3.0 to 3.8. The gas extraction occurred in one temperature step at ~1700 °C, followed by separation into three fractions, He-Ne, Ar, and Kr-Xe, measured successively in a custom-built mass spectrometer. For each sample, complete gas extraction was verified by a re-extraction step at ~1750 °C. Details on the sample preparation and measurement protocols can be found in.

**Results and Discussion:** In most cases, the gas concentrations for all five noble gases decrease with increasing petrologic subtype, and the trend is most pronounced for Ne. An exception is e.g. CO3.0 Colony, which is strongly terrestrially weathered. CO3.8 Isna shows an unusually short expo-sure time to cosmic rays (~0.15 Ma), which may be explained by a direct injection into a mean orbital resonance shortly after collision. The currently ill-defined Ar-rich carrier phase, found only in the least aqueously altered CM and CR samples, is still abundantly present in the predominately anhydrous CO chondrites, indicating that this component is less susceptible to moderately elevated temperatures. No CO chondrites examined so far contain solar wind, supporting the hypothesis that CO chondrites originate from the asteroidal interior. It thus remains enigmatic which material could account for the surface layer."

The estimates for aggregate annual number of flights are validated against data published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The corresponding fuel usage is estimated using the International Civilian Aviation Organization (ICAO) fuel use tables and carbon dioxide emissions are calculated using a fuel-use multiplicative factor. A key conclusion of this analysis is that a small number of long-haul flights (with ranges greater than 2485 statute miles) create a disproportionately large fraction (30%) of annual total U.S. aviation-related carbon dioxide emissions, while a relatively large number of short flights (less than 311 statute miles) contribute a small net amount (less than 5%) of U.S. aviation-related carbon dioxide emissions. These U.S. results are consistent with a similar recent 2020 emissions study conducted by EUROCONTROL."

In recent decades, contrasting SO2 trends have been observed over different regions of the globe due to urbanization, energy generation and control measures. In this study, we have investigated the SO2 trends over the rapidly developing Indian subcontinent using model reanalysis, satellite data, and emission inventories during 2003–2019 period. Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis shows rapid SO2 growth up to 0.4 ppbv/yr during 2003–2009, particularly significant over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and eastern India. However, the growth becomes slower after 2010 and is followed by a stabilization or slight reduction. The CAMS results agree with the satellite-based observations, however, the model underestimates enhancements over eastern India. The analysis of inventory datasets also suggests slower growths in SO2 emissions and coal-fired electricity generation in recent years. Besides the changes in regional emissions, the enhancements in water vapor and OH radical coinciding with SO2 stabilization indicate strengthening of the sink processes. Model simulation (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2―MERRA-2) with constant emissions shows reduction in SO2 which confirms the stronger chemical losses. Overall, the SO2 trends over the Indian subcontinent are found to be a manifestation of the combined effects of the regional emission change and chemistry. Our findings highlight the need for studies to assess the impacts of changing SO2 trends in India on the regional and global climate."

In this paper we use MCARS to study the MODIS Above-Cloud AEROsol retrieval algorithm (MOD06ACAERO). MOD06ACAERO is presently a regional research algorithm able to retrieve aerosol optical thickness over clouds, in particular absorbing biomass burning aerosols overlying marine boundary layer clouds in the Southeastern Atlantic Ocean. The algorithm’s ability to provide aerosol information in cloudy conditions makes it a valuable source of information for modeling and climate studies  n an area where current clear sky-only operational MODIS aerosol retrievals effectively have a data gap between the months of June and October. We use MCARS for a verification and closure study of the MOD06ACAERO algorithm. The purpose of this study is to develop a set of constraints a model developer might use during assimilation of MOD06ACAERO data. Our simulations indicate that the MOD06ACAERO algorithm performs well for marine boundary layer clouds in the SE Atlantic provided some specific screening rules are observed.

For the present study, a combination of five simulated MODIS data granules was used for a dataset of 13.5 million samples with known input conditions. When pixel retrieval uncertainty was less than 30%, optical thickness of the underlying cloud layer was greater than 4 and scattering angle range within the cloud bow was excluded, MOD06ACAERO retrievals agreed with the underlying ground truth (GEOS-5 cloud and aerosol profiles used to generate the synthetic radiances) with a slope of 0.913, offset of 0.06, and RMSE=0.107. When only
 near-nadir pixels were considered (view zenith angle within +/-20 degrees) the agreement with source data further improved (0.977, 0.051 and 0.096 respectively). Algorithm closure was examined using a single case out of the five 38 used for verification. For closure, the MOD06ACAERO code was modified to use GEOS-5 temperature and moisture profiles as ancillary. Agreement of MOD06ACAERO retrievals with source data for the closure study had a slope of 0.996 with offset -0.007 and RMSE of 0.097 at pixel uncertainty level of less than 40%, illustrating the benefits of high-quality ancillary atmospheric data for such retrievals."

A stream interaction region (SIR), sequentially observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at R = 0.76 au and 48° east from Earth (ϕ = E48°), STEREO-A (at R = 0.96 au, ϕ = E39°), Solar Orbiter (SolO; at R = 0.68 au, ϕ = E15°), BepiColombo (at R = 0.33 au, ϕ = W02°), and near-Earth spacecraft, regulated the observed intensity-time profiles and the anisotropic character of the SEP event. PSP, STEREO-A, and SolO detected strong anisotropies at the onset of the SEP event, which resulted from the fact that PSP and STEREO-A were in the declining-speed region of the solar wind stream responsible for the SIR and from the passage of a steady magnetic field structure by SolO during the onset of the event. By contrast, the intensity-time profiles observed near Earth displayed a delayed onset at proton energies ≳13 MeV and an accumulation of ≲5 MeV protons between the SIR and the shock driven by the parent coronal mass ejection (CME). Even though BepiColombo, STEREO-A, and SolO were nominally connected to the same region of the Sun, the intensity-time profiles at BepiColombo resemble those observed near Earth, with the bulk of low-energy ions also confined between the SIR and the CME-driven shock. This event exemplifies the impact that intervening large-scale interplanetary structures, such as corotating SIRs, have in shaping the properties of SEP events."

The dcs-distribution displays a nearly exponential decay from a peak at dcs=25 di to a median at dcs=85 di and a 95th percentile at dcs=905 di with a maximum exhaust width at dcs=8077 di. A magnetic field ϴ-rotation angle distribution increases linearly from a relatively few high-shear events toward a broad peak at 35o<ϴ<65o. The azimuthal φ-angles of the CS normal directions of 430 thick dcs≥500 di exhausts are consistent with a dominant Parker-spiral magnetic field and a CS normal along the ortho-Parker direction. The CS normal orientations of 370 kinetic-scale dcs<25 di exhausts are isotropic in contrast, and likely associated with Alfvénic solar wind turbulence. We propose that the alignment of exhaust normal directions from narrow dcs~15-25 di widths to well beyond dcs~500 di with an ortho-Parker azimuthal  direction of a large-scale HCS is a consequence of CS bifurcation and turbulence within the HCS exhaust that may trigger reconnection of the adjacent pair of bifurcated CSs. The proposed HCS-31 avalanche scenario suggests that the underlying large-scale parent HCS closer to the Sun evolves with heliocentric distance to fracture into many, more or less aligned, secondary current sheets due to reconnection. A few wide exhaust-associated HCS-like CSs could represent a population of HCSs that failed to reconnect as frequently between the Sun and 1 AU as other HCSs."

In particular, the three critical parameters required for trajectory prediction are the thrust setting, drag coefficients, and takeoff weight of the aircraft. Unfortunately, these parameters are coupled and appear together in physics-based kinetic models. Past approaches utilize data from a specific phase of flight (climb, level flight or descent), where one or more of the parameters are assumed to be known and estimate the remaining unknown parameters. This approach introduces bias/errors and also does not extend to scenarios where all of the above parameters are not known with sufficient accuracy.

This paper is the first of its kind to propose a generalized framework for simultaneous estimation of all three critical APM parameters (thrust, drag, and mass). The proposed approach utilizes data from both the climb and descent phases and fits the ordinary differential equation for altitude in each phase using historical trajectory data available from radar tracks or ADS-B. The approach yields a set of optimized APM parameters that are best suited to fit each historical flight record. The methodology is applied on on sample flights from three different aircraft types, and the results demonstrate low fit error and consequently will yield a high level of prediction accuracy."

Tropical phenological data are comparatively scarce and viewed through the lens of a ‘temperate phenological paradigm’ expecting phenological traits to respond to strong, predictably annual shifts in climate (e.g., between subfreezing and frost-free periods). Digitized herbarium data greatly expand existing phenological data for tropical plants; and circular data, statistics, and models are more appropriate for analyzing tropical (and temperate) phenological datasets. Phylogenetic information, which remains seldom applied in phenological investigations, provides new insights into phenological responses of large groups of related species to climate. Consistent combined use of herbarium data, circular statistical distributions, and robust phylogenies will rapidly advance our understanding of tropical – and temperate – phenology."

We use a flexible bulk microphysics scheme with bin scheme process parameterizations, called AMP, to investigate reasons for the difficulty. AMP is configured in a variety of ways to mimic bulk schemes and is compared to simulations with the bin scheme upon which AMP is built. We find that an important limitation in traditional bulk schemes is the use of separate cloud and rain categories. When the drop size distribution is instead represented by a continuous distribution, the simulation of cloud-to-rain conversion is substantially improved. We also find large sensitivity to the threshold size to distinguish cloud and rain in traditional schemes; substantial improvement is found by decreasing the threshold from 40 to 25 μm. Neither the use of an assumed functional form for the size distribution nor the choice of predicted distribution moments has a large impact on the ability of AMP to simulate rain production. When predicting four total moments of the liquid drop size distribution, either with a traditional two-category, two-moment scheme with a reduced size threshold, or a four-moment single-category scheme, errors in the evolution of mass and the cloud size distribution are similar, but the single-category scheme has a substantially better representation of the rain size distribution. Optimal moment combinations for the single-category approach are investigated and appear to be linked more to the information content they provide for constraining the size distributions than to their correlation with collision-coalescence rates."

California’s Tulare Basin is no exception, experiencing about a meter of subsidence between 2015 and 2020. However, understanding the relationship between changes in groundwater volumes and ground deformation has proven difficult. We employ surface displacement measurements from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and gravimetric estimates of terrestrial water storage from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite pair to characterize the hydrological dynamics within the Tulare basin. The removal of the long-term aquifer compaction from the InSAR time series reveals coherent short-term variations that correlate with hydrological features. For example, in the winter of 2018–2019 uplift is observed at the confluence of several rivers and streams that drain into the southeastern edge of the basin. These observations, combined with estimates of mass changes obtained from the orbiting GRACE satellites, form the basis for imaging the monthly spatial variations in water volumes. This approach facilitates the quick and effective synthesis of InSAR and gravimetric datasets and will aid efforts to improve our understanding and management of groundwater resources around the world."

The proposed mechanism consists of the formation of an anomalously strong Equator-to-pole temperature gradient in the stratosphere due to the presence of volcanic aerosols in the tropics, which are accompanied by an acceleration of the stratospheric polar vortex, which then shifts the Northern Annular Mode into a positive phase, resulting in warming surface temperatures over Eurasia.

However, a large body of research in the past decade has shown that, for eruptions such as Pinatubo or Krakatau, no such warming is seen in simulations with more recent climate models which, in general, have much finer vertical and horizontal resolution than the early ones, and which have separated the forced response from the internal variability by using large ensembles of integrations. Since the proposed physical mechanism is sound, it is then possible that eruptions comparable to those of Pinatubo or Krakatau are simply too weak, but even larger ones might indeed be capable of causing Eurasian surface warming in winter.

In this study, we explore this possibility using a state-of-the-art, stratosphere-resolving climate model, forced with prescribed aerosols from the Easy Volcanic Aerosol protocol. We consider eruptions with stratospheric sulfur injections of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 Tg(S). With 20-member ensembles, we find that with injections of 20 Tg(S) or more – roughly twice the amplitude of the Pinatubo and Krakatau eruptions – our model simulates a winter surface warming over Eurasia, which is statistically significant with a t test given our 20-member ensembles. However, the forced volcanic signal on Eurasian winter surface temperatures is very small, barely exceeding the 1σ range of internal variability for the 160 Tg(S) injection case, and much smaller for smaller eruptions. Most importantly, the number of eruptions needed to establish statistical significance is considerably larger than the number of eruptions known to have occurred in the past 2000 years."

Passive (SMAP) satellite missions, Catchment Land Surface

Among these is the vicarious calibration coefficient (g) of the ‘long’ near infrared band (NIRL) used for atmospheric correction. For this band, the pre-launch calibration has always been deemed sufficient [thus g(NIRL)
= 1.00] as long as other bands are vicariously calibrated. Recent research, however, suggests that MODIS/Aqua RRS time series are quite sensitive to g(NIRL) (and associated vicarious gains in other bands). In this work, we assessed the sensitivity of VIIRS/SNPP RRS to NIRL calibration, and compared our results to previous MODIS/Aqua and SeaWiFS/OrbView2 analysis. In doing so, we note g(NIRL)
sensitivities of mission-averaged RRS timeseries are lower for VIIRS and SeaWiFS, relative to MODIS. At the scale of monthly climatologies, however, all sensors show prominent g(NIRL) sensitivity, with that of SeaWiFS being the most substantial. These findings informed simulation analyses, whereby we identified signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and radiant path geometry, as well as their interaction, as having notable impacts on g(NIRL) sensitivity. As such, g(NIRL) sensitivity is a necessary consideration for reflectance uncertainty budgets, especially for sensors with higher NIR SNR or particular prevailing radiant path geometries. Given the geometry components embedded
within g(NIRL) sensitivity, such studies should be coupled with cross-sensor intercalibrations (e.g., using simultaneous same view measurements) toward minimizing NIRL errors between satellite instruments, but such efforts will not completely remediate remaining cross-sensor biases in RRS."

A robust algorithm is developed to retrieve global D/E-region Ne from the high-rate GNSS radio occultation (RO) data, to improve spatio-temporal coverage using recent SmallSat/CubeSat constellations.The new algorithm removes F-region contributions in the RO excess phase profile by fitting a linear function to the data below the D-region.The new GNSS-RO observations reveal many interesting features in the diurnal, seasonal, solar-cycle, and magnetic-field-dependent variations in the Ne morphology. While the D/E-region Ne is a function of solar zenith angle (c), it exhibits strong latitudinal variations for the same c with a distribution asymmetric about noon. In addition, large longitudinal variations are observed along the same magnetic field pitch angle. The summer-midlatitude Ne and sporadic-E(Es) show a distribution similar to each other. The distribution of auroral electron precipitation correlates better with the pitch angle from the magnetosphere than from one at100 km. Finally, anew TEC retrieval technique is developed for the high-rate RO data with a top reaching at least 120 km. For better characterization of the E-to-F transition in Ne and more accurate TEC retrievals, it is recommended to have all GNSS-RO acquisition routinely up to 220 km."

Our evaluation necessitated the creation of a reference observational dataset that resolves horizontal and vertical cloud variability. The dataset combines two CloudSat cloud products that resolve two-dimensional cloud optical depth variability of liquid, ice, and mixed phase clouds when blended at ~200 m vertical and ~ 2 km horizontal scales. Upon segmenting the dataset to individual “scenes”, mean profiles of the cloud fields are passed as input to generators that produce scene-level cloud subgrid variability. The assessment of generator performance at the scale of individual scenes and in a mean sense is largely based on inferred joint histograms that partition cloud fraction within predetermined combinations of cloud top pressure –cloud optical thickness ranges. Our main finding is that both generators tend to underestimate optically thin clouds, while one of them also tends to overestimate some cloud types of moderate and high optical thickness. Associated radiative flux errors are also calculated by applying a simple transformation to the cloud fraction histogram errors, and are found to approach values almost as high as 3 Wm-2 for the cloud radiative effect in the shortwave part of the spectrum."

The radio filament spans 200 kpc and aligns with a sloshing  cold  front  seen  in  the  X-rays,  staying  inside  the  front  in  projection.   The radio spectral index along the filament appears uniform (within large uncertainties) atα' −1.5.   We  propose  that  the  radio  galaxy  is  located  outside  the  cold  front,  but dips  its  tail  under  the  front.   The  tangential  wind  that  blows  there  may  stretch  the radio plasma from the radio galaxy into a filamentary structure.  Some reacceleration is needed in this scenario to maintain the radio spectrum uniform.  Alternatively, the cosmic ray electrons from that spot in the tail can spread along the cluster magnetic field lines,  straightened by that same tangential flow,  via anomalously fast diffusion. Our radio filament can provide constraints on this process.  We also uncover a compact radio source at the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) that is 2–3 orders of magnitude"

This loss of variance has been attributed to reduced-rank representations of the covariance matrix, as in ensemble methods for example, or else to the use of dissipative numerical methods.  Through a combination of analytical work and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that significant variance loss, as well as gain, typically occurs during covariance propagation, even at full rank. The cause of this unusual behavior is a discontinuous change in the continuum covariance dynamics as correlation lengths become small, for instance in the vicinity of sharp gradients in the velocity field.  This discontinuity in the covariance dynamics arises from hyperbolicity:  the diagonal of the kernel of the covariance operator is a characteristic surface for advective dynamics. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that standard numerical methods for evolving the state are not adequate for propagating the covariance, because16they do not capture the discontinuity in the continuum covariance dynamics as correlations lengths tend to zero.  Our analytical and numerical results show that this leads to significant, spurious variance loss in certain regions, and gain in others.  The results suggest that developing local covariance propagation methods designed specifically to capture covariance evolution near the diagonal may prove a useful alternative to current methods of covariance propagation."

We present the responses of ozone to individual forcings and an attribution of changes in ozone columns and vertically resolved stratospheric and tropospheric ozone to these forcings. We find that whilst substantial ODS-induced ozone loss dominates the stratospheric ozone changes since the 1970s, in agreement with previous studies, increases in tropospheric ozone due to increases in short-lived ozone precursors and methane since the 1950s make increasingly important contributions to total column ozone (TCO) changes. Increases in methane also lead to substantial extra-tropical stratospheric ozone increases. Impacts of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide on stratospheric ozone are significant but their impacts on TCO are small overall due to several opposing factors and are also associated with large dynamical variability. The multi-model mean (MMM) results show a clear change in the stratospheric ozone trends after 2000 due to now declining ODSs, but the trends are generally not significantly positive, except in the extra-tropical upper stratosphere, due to relatively small changes in forcing over this period combined with large model uncertainty. Although the MMM ozone compares well with the observations, the inter-model differences are large primarily due to the large differences in the models' representation of ODS-induced ozone depletion."

Here, we use climate, crop and fishery models to estimate the impacts arising from six scenarios of stratospheric soot injection, predicting the total food calories available in each nation post-war after stored food is consumed. In quantifying impacts away from target areas, we demonstrate that soot injections larger than 5 Tg would lead to mass food shortages, and livestock and aquatic food production would be unable to compensate for reduced crop output, in almost all countries. Adaptation measures such as food waste reduction would have limited impact on increasing available calories. We estimate more than 2 billion people could die from nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and more than 5 billion could die from a war between the United States and Russia—underlining the importance of global cooperation in preventing nuclear war."

Rising sea levels are one particularly concerning manifestation of this and many of the world’s largest cities are vulnerable to sea level rise (SLR). Thus, urban climate adaptation and mitigation policies are increasingly important to protect population health.
Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether being at risk of SLR was associated with city-level climate action. It also aimed to assess the wider drivers of climate action in cities, in order to guide ongoing efforts to motivate climate action, assess public health preparedness and identify research gaps.
Methods: This is an ecological cross-sectional study using secondary data from CDP, the Urban Climate Change Research Network (UCCRN), World Bank, United Nations Cities and EM-DAT (Emergency Events Database). The study population consisted of 517 cities who participated in CDP’s 2019 Cities Survey. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess the relationship between risk of SLR and city-level climate action, and secondly, to assess the wider determinants of city-level climate action.
Results: There was evidence of crude associations between risk of SLR and three outcome variables representing city-level climate action. However, after adjusting for confounding variables, these crude associations disappeared. World region, national income status and urban population were shown to be stronger predictors of city-level climate action.
Conclusion: It is concerning for population health that there is no association demonstrated between risk of SLR and climate action. This could indicate a lack of awareness of the risks posed by SLR within urban governance. To fulfil their health protection responsibilities, it is essential that public health professionals take a leading role in advocating for climate action."

Extending to smaller length scales, wewill report on simulations following accretion all the down to theevent horizons so that we may begin to investigate how black hole spinaffects mini-disk dynamics, accretion rate, and jet power.

Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Potential Release Location (PRL) 237, located in Merritt Island, Brevard County, Florida for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under Contract 80KSC019D0010/80KSC019F0289. A Phase I SA and CS Report was previously submitted that identified 33 locations of concern (LOCs) at KSC associated with the storage, use, or release of materials containing PFAS.  

The objectives of the Phase II and III SA and CS were to:
- Complete site and source characterization of identified LOCs;
- Identify areas of potential concern (AOPCs) where past or present activities may have resulted in a release of PFAS to the environment;
- Qualitatively characterize migration potential of released PFAS to environmental media (primarily soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediment); and
- Identify potential receptors for exposure to PFAS-impacted environmental media.

Surface water samples were collected from LOCs/AOPCs and locations on the KSC periphery during PFAS CS Phases I, II and III. Including duplicate samples, 143 environmental samples were analyzed for 14 PFAS compounds and 104 environmental samples were analyzed for 18 PFAS compounds. Ten of the analytes on the 14 compound list were detected at least once in surface water at KSC, with a wide range in magnitude of detections.  The State of Florida has surface water screening levels (SWSLs) for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in surface water, both for human and ecological receptors. The human health screening levels are lower than the ecological ones and are used in this report.  PFOA was not detected in surface water at concentrations exceeding the SWSL at any LOC or Area of Potential Concern (AOPC).  PFOS was detected in surface water at concentrations exceeding the SWSL at 28 LOCs/AOPCs, plus 42 locations on the KSC periphery. The data suggest a wide distribution of PFAS, particularly PFOS, in surface water but the sources of surface water contamination are not yet adequately understood.

Sediment samples were collected during Phases II and III but not Phase I. Including duplicate samples, 104 environmental samples were analyzed for 14 PFAS compounds and 10 environmental samples were analyzed for 18 PFAS compounds. Twelve compounds were detected in sediment at KSC, with a wide range in magnitude of detections. There are currently no screening levels or cleanup target levels (CTLs) for sediment. The need to delineate and further characterize PFAS in sediment will be evaluated for those sites that move
forward into Site Assessment.

Groundwater samples were collected via DPT from LOCs/AOPCs and locations on the KSC periphery during PFAS CS Phases I, II and III. Including duplicate samples, 812 environmental DPT groundwater samples were analyzed for 14 PFAS compounds and 247 environmental samples were analyzed for 18 PFAS compounds. Twelve of the 14 compounds were detected in groundwater at KSC, with a wide range in magnitude of detections.  The State of Florida has provisional groundwater cleanup target levels (GCTLs) for PFOA, PFOS and the additive concentration of PFOA+PFOS.  PFOA was detected in groundwater at concentrations exceeding its provisional GCTL at 16 LOCs/AOPCs, with no exceedances on the KSC periphery.  PFOS was detected in groundwater at concentrations exceeding its provisional GCTL at 30 LOCs/AOPCs, plus two locations on the KSC periphery.  PFOA+PFOS was detected in groundwater at concentrations exceeding the provisional GCTL at 31 LOCs/AOPCs, plus two locations on the KSC periphery.

Soil samples were collected during Phases II and III but not Phase I. Including duplicate samples, 292 environmental samples were analyzed for 14 PFAS compounds and 80 environmental samples were analyzed for 18 PFAS compounds. Fourteen compounds were detected in soil at KSC, with a wide range in magnitude of detections.  The State of Florida has provisional soil cleanup target levels (SCTLs) for PFOA and PFOS.  There were no PFOA results above its provisional SCTL.  There was one LOC with a result above the provisional SCTL for residential settings.

Recommendations are presented for each LOC and AOPC."

measurements. The method relies upon having a small (∼10 per cent) reference sample of high-quality redshifts. Within pencil-
beam-like sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy, we use the precise dN/dz distribution of the reference sample to recover new
redshifts and assign them one-to-one to galaxies such that the original rank order of redshifts is preserved. Preserving the rank
order is motivated by the fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability density functions with different means
but equal standard deviations satisfy stochastic ordering. This process is repeated for sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy in
the survey. This results in every galaxy being assigned multiple ‘recovered’ redshifts from which a new redshift estimate is
determined. An earlier paper applied SORT to a mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey at z 0.2 and accurately recovered the two-point
correlation function (2PCF) on scales > 4 h−1Mpc. In this paper, we test the performance of SORT in surveys spanning the
redshift range 0.75 < z < 2.25. We used two mock surveys extracted from the Small MultiDark–Planck and Bolshoi–Planck
N-body simulations with dark matter haloes that were populated by the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model. We find that SORT
overall improves redshift estimates, accurately recovers the redshift-space 2PCF ξ (s) on scales > 2.5 h−1Mpc, and provides
improved local density estimates in regions of average or higher density, which may allow for improved understanding of how
galaxy properties relate to their environments."

This is a follow on to the investigation on the effect of grazing flow on grooved over-the-rotor casing treatments. The purpose of this modeling investigation stems from the determination that traditional liner modeling techniques are inadequate for nontraditional internal liner cavity geometries. A series of these expansion chamber type liner design concepts were previously developed by Glenn Research Center and tested using the Langley Research Center Normal Incidence Tube. The measured normalized impedance and absorption coefficient is compared with that obtained from the COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation. Additionally, using a parametric case study, another series of simulations were conducted to determine what additional benefits, if any, this genre of liner has to offer the acoustics community. A total of 53 permutations of this concept was investigated. The results indicate that with longer internal fins, the resonance is sifted to lower frequencies."

A leading hypothesis, supported by indirect evidence, is that in most of the corona heating is confined to narrow current sheets in which energy is dissipated despite the low large-scale resistivity of the coronal plasma. Although the kinetic scales of reconnection or wave heating are beyond remote observation, thermal structure on scales ≲100 km are expected to be produced by the primary heating mechanisms operating within a filamentary magnetic field. This white paper considers what could be learned from direct observations of coronal plasma on those scales and outlines a mission concept that is more fully described in a Heliophysics Mission Concept Study for the Coronal Microscale Observatory."

These radio emissions, in the range of a few kHz to 1 MHz, are emitted by electrons travelling around auroral magnetic field lines. Their study is useful to understand the variability of a magnetosphere and its coupling with the solar wind. Previous studies have shown a strong correlation between the solar wind dynamic pressure and the SKR intensity. However, up to now, the effect of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) has never been examined in detail, due to the lack of SKR observations at the time when an ICME can be tracked and its different parts be clearly identified. In this study, we take advantage of a large ICME that reached Saturn mid-November 2014 (Witasse et al., J. Geophys. Res. Space Physics, 2017, 122, 7865–7890). At that time, the Cassini spacecraft was fortunately travelling within the solar wind for a few days, and provided a very accurate timing of the ICME structure. A survey of the Cassini data for the same period indicated a significant increase in the SKR emissions, showing a good correlation after the passage of the ICME shock with a delay of ∼13 h and after the magnetic cloud passage with a delay of 25–42 h."

In the past decade, thanks to advances in multiwavelength imaging spectroscopy, as well as developments in theories and numerical modeling, significant progress has been made in improving our understanding of solar flare/eruption energy release. In particular, broadband imaging spectroscopy at microwave wavelengths offered by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) has enabled the revolutionary capability of measuring the time-evolving coronal magnetic fields at or near the flare reconnection region. However, owing to EOVSA’s limited dynamic range, imaging fidelity, and angular resolution, such measurements can only be done in a region around the brightest source(s) where the signal-to-noise is sufficiently large. In this white paper, after a brief introduction to the outstanding questions and challenges pertinent to magnetic energy release in solar flares and eruptions, we will demonstrate how a next-generation radio facility with many (∼100–200) antenna elements can bring the next revolution by enabling high dynamic range, high fidelity broadband imaging spectropolarimetry along with a sub-second time resolution and arcsecond level angular resolution. We recommend to prioritize the implementation of such a ground-based instrument within this decade. We also call for facilitating multi-wavelength, multi-messenger observations and advanced numerical modeling in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the “system science” of solar flares and eruptions."

The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the current iteration of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, termed the R Series (GOES-R), however, provides sub-hourly imagery and the opportunity to overcome this deficit and to leverage a large repository of existing GOES-R aquatic observations. The fulfillment of this opportunity is assessed herein using a spectrally simplified, two-channel aquatic algorithm consistent with ABI wave bands to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically available radiation, K(d)(PAR). First, an in situ ABI dataset was synthesized using a globally representative dataset of above- and in-water radiometric data products. Values of K(d)(PAR) were estimated by fitting the ratio of the shortest and longest visible wave bands from the in situ ABI dataset to coincident, in situ K(d)(PAR) data products. The algorithm was evaluated based on an iterative cross-validation analysis in which 80% of the dataset was randomly partitioned for fitting and the remaining 20% was used for validation. The iteration producing the median coefficient of determination (R2) value (0.88) resulted in a root mean square difference of 0.319 m−1, or 8.5% of the range in the validation dataset. Second, coincident mid-day images of central and southern California from ABI and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were compared using Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE default ABI reflectance values were adjusted based on a near infrared signal. Matchups between the ABI and MODIS imagery indicated similar spatial variability (R2 = 0.60) between ABI adjusted blue-to-red reflectance ratio values and MODIS default diffuse attenuation coefficient for spectral downward irradiance at 490 nm, K(d)(490), values. This work demonstrates that if an operational capability to provide- ABI aquatic data products was realized, the spectral configuration of ABI would potentially support a sub-hourly, visible aquatic data product that is applicable to water-mass tracing and physical oceanography research."

AI ethics is still an emerging field, and the partners for this workshop and report seek to move AI ethics discussion ahead by experimenting with ways to measure AI ethics criteria. The following document describes the outcomes and learnings from The Ethical Artificial Intelligence Quantification Workshop held at the National Institute for Aerospace (NIA), Hampton, Virginia on May 12th, 2022. The purpose of the workshop was for participants to evaluate and experiment-with the methodology and process presented by AIEthics.World in cooperation with Intel Corporation. The meeting participants learned about the Ethical AI Certification and Maturity Model™ and applied the methodology to selected notional AI systems. The workshop facilitated the evaluation of the maturity of the AI system according to ethical considerations relevant to NASA, NIA and other participants. 

The workshop consisted of three main phases. The first phase focused on understanding and summarizing NASA’s ethical approaches, mission and values based on published documentation, discussions and individual insights & opinions of participants. This information was prioritized, weighted, ordered, and quantified in phase two, to formulate an alignment between human values (ethics) and their applicability to AI systems during all lifecycle phases. The first two phases were summarized as a form of ethical genealogy for artificial intelligence, specific to NASA’s ethical approaches. In the third and last phase of the workshop the participants evaluated notional examples of artificial intelligence to qualify and quantify its ability to adhere to the organizational ethics approaches, using the Ethical AI Certification and Maturity Model™. 

The workshop uses the concept of genealogy, in the traditional sense: the study and traceability of lines of ancestors in the process of evolutionary development from earlier forms. However, as it is applied to an Ethical AI definition, it is providing the insights to the necessary and mandatory traceability of content, data, metrics, telemetry, elements, and structures which are used in the AI’s lifecycle to foster and measure AI ethics in all steps of its lifecycle. The Ethical Artificial Intelligence Quantification Workshop provided NASA with the opportunity to apply the Ethical AI Certification and Maturity Model™, in combination with existing and well-known decision-making and quality control methods to identify the metrics and measurements for an Ethical AI and assess its ethical condition and quality aligned with NASA ethics approaches. The result of the workshop is the capacity for NASA to apply the maturity model assessment to its AI Systems as desired and if necessary, publish the ability of these AI Systems to adhere to the organizational ethical goals. AI ethics frameworks need to be customized for each application domain, for example, individual NASA Mission Directorates. General principles that work in one area such as AI/Machine Learning-based text analysis (the ethics of information-extraction) may need to be adapted for another such as sense-and-avoid decision-making in a flight environment. 

The workshop was conducted among approximately twenty NASA subject matter experts, so the elements noted above should be considered examples, not definitive NASA ethical AI principles, genealogy, etc. Generating a definitive AI ethics framework for an organization as diverse as NASA would require far more discussion, debate, review, etc. However, the workshop provided valuable insight into mechanisms and processes for quantifying AI ethical qualities."

The joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality field campaign took place in August 2019, and involved two aircraft and coordinated ground-based observations. The AVIRIS-C instrument acquired data from onboard NASA's high altitude ER-2 research aircraft, coincident in space and time with aerosol observations obtained from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) DRAGON mobile platform in the smoke plume downwind of the Williams Flats Fire in northern Washington in August 2019. Observations in this smoke plume were used to assess the capacity of optimal-estimation based retrievals to simultaneously estimate aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface reflectance from Visible Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectroscopy. Radiative transfer modeling of the sensitivities in spectral information collected over smoke reveal the potential capacity of high spectral resolution retrievals to distinguish between sulfate and smoke aerosol models, as well as sensitivity to the aerosol size distribution. Comparison with ground-based AERONET observations demonstrates that AVIRIS-C retrievals of AOD compare favorably with direct sun AOD measurements. Our analyses suggest that spectral information collected from the full VSWIR spectral interval, not just the shortest wavelengths, enables accurate retrievals. We use this approach to continuously map both aerosols and surface reflectance at high spatial resolution across heterogeneous terrain, even under relatively high AOD conditions associated with wildfire smoke."

already have a substantial negative influence on agriculture and the economy and finding ways to reduce their effects could have a monumental impact. Although NASA already has satellites deployed to collect drought data, these satellites are more for global drought indexing than local.

To alleviate droughts on a local level, this paper proposes the use of drones to map soil moisture, plant health, and other drought indicators. The proposed drone design is a fixed-wing UAV equipped with a hyperspectral camera, a LiDAR sensor, and an array of weather sensors. These tools will permit it to reliably capture the necessary data to enhance suggestions on improving drought management practices.

The collected data from the drones will be deployable in many ways, including for
agricultural and non-agricultural applications. The hyperspectral camera has applications in monitoring the health of crops within a field to direct relief measures to the crops most in need. Thermal and LiDAR imaging can be deployed for locating leaks, predicting shortages of water bodies, and determining a field’s water needs.

To implement a drought-monitoring drone, the recommended steps include building a
prototype drone design that is equipped with the outlined instruments. The prototype drone could then be deployed to collect training data to guide a neural network that would provide interpretations and predictions from the data for users. After the prototype design is iterated upon, it will be ready for deployment and inform water management methods to serve the world in our battle against drought."

Choosing between triggers requires knowledge of pre-eruptive magnetic fields (B). Although linear polarization in visible/infrared (VIR) coronal emission lines reveals intriguing clues about coronal mass ejection (CME) precursor topology, small telescope apertures limit current capability for measuring vector field. Current coronal observations are insufficient to diagnose 3D coronal magnetic fields in CME precursors. 

Coronal cavities are the ideal candidates for CME precursor studies. BLOS in cavities is a direct measure of stored magnetic free energy, and the presence and location of topological X-points (reconnection locations) and O-points (circulation of B about axis) distinguish predictions of the flux rope-torus-instability and sheared-arcade-breakout CME models.
-	Finding: Coronal cavities are ubiquitous throughout the solar cycle, erupt as CMEs, and have coronal polarimetric signatures that distinguish between model predictions.
-	Recommendation: Coronal cavities should be targeted in a comprehensive multiwavelength study of CME precursors & associated eruption-driving mechanisms.

Large ground-based VIR telescopes can measure both coronal magnetic field topology and strength through a combination of the saturated Hanle and BLOS -sensitive Zeeman effects.
-	Finding: The 4m Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) and proposed 1.5m Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory Large Coronagraph (COSMO-LC) make a major leap forward in VIR coronal sensitivity, enabling measurement of vector B.
-	Recommendation: A dedicated coronal synoptic telescope with a large field-of-view (i.e., COSMO-LC) is needed to identify the dominant CME driving mechanisms, by measuring coronal magnetic fields from precursor state into eruption.
In the UV, a new opportunity has arisen to make use of the strong H I Lyman-α coronal line, which obtains a measurement of B that is independent of the Zeeman effect.
-	Finding: Small-telescope spectropolarimetric capability in the unsaturated Hanle regime provides an independent and complementary coronal magnetic diagnostic to large ground-based telescope measurements.
-	Recommendation: The proposed 12-cm Coronal Lyman-α Resonance Observatory (CLARO) spectropolarimetric coronagraph demonstrates a path forward for space-based observations of the coronal magnetic field that should be incorporated into future missions away from the Sun-Earth line (e.g., COMPLETE)."

Simulation and forecasting of streamflow are challenging tasks for hydrologists, especially in sparsely gauged areas. Coarse spatial resolution remote sensing soil moisture products (equal to or larger than 9 km) are often assimilated into hydrological models to improve streamflow simulation in large catchments. This study uses the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) technique to assimilate SMAP soil moisture products at the coarse spatial resolution of 9 km (SMAP 9 km), and downscaled SMAP soil moisture product at the higher spatial resolution of 1 km (SMAP 1 km), into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the usefulness of different spatial and temporal resolutions of remotely sensed soil moisture products in streamflow simulation and forecasting. The experiment was set up for eight catchments across the tropical climate of Vietnam, with varying catchment areas from 267 to 6430 km^2 during the period 2017–2019. We comprehensively evaluated the EnKF-based SWAT model in simulating streamflow at low, average, and high flow. Our results indicated that high-spatial resolution of downscaled SMAP 1 km is more beneficial in the data assimilation framework in aiding the accuracy of streamflow simulation, as compared to that of SMAP 9 km, especially for the small catchments. Our analysis on the impact of observation resolution also indicates that the improvement in the streamflow simulation with data assimilation is more significant at catchments where downscaled SMAP 1 km has fewer missing observations. This study is helpful for adding more understanding of performances of soil moisture data assimilation based hydrological modelling over the tropical climate region, and exhibits the potential use of remote sensing data assimilation in hydrology."

However, these ML applications have largely evolved in ‘isolation’ from the mechanistic, process-based modelling (PBM) paradigms, which have historically been the cornerstone of scientific discovery and policy support. In this perspective, we assert that the cultural barriers between the ML and PBM communities limit the potential of ML, and even its ‘hybridization’ with PBM, for EES applications. Fundamental, but often ignored, differences between ML and PBM are discussed as well as their strengths and weaknesses in light of three overarching modelling objectives in EES, (1) nowcasting and prediction, (2) scenario analysis, and (3) diagnostic learning. The paper ponders over a ‘coevolutionary’ approach to model building, shifting away from a borrowing to a co-creation culture, to develop a generation of models that leverage the unique strengths of ML such as scalability to big data and high-dimensional mapping, while remaining faithful to process-based knowledge base and principles of model explainability and interpretability, and therefore, falsifiability."

This paper examines the possible application of algorithmic path planning for UAV reconnaissance to reduce damage and safety risks, as aforementioned. When the location of a wildfire is known, UAVs are immediately dispatched from an operating base to fly to the fire and support the firefighters as quickly as possible. Then, the algorithm incrementally analyzes different environmental factors to create a path for the UAV to follow. This work focuses on generating a path for the UAV to follow given a set of polygons representing obstacles. The most important features of this algorithm are its fast response time and obstacle maneuverability.

As the aviation sector is projected to grow and as new aircraft are introduced, aviation’s impact on climate change will only increase. Without sustainable alternatives implemented in the near future, aviation could strongly contribute to making this planet uninhabitable. This paper examines the possibilities of electric aviation and other power sources in reducing the impact of aviation on climate change. Although there are many power sources for aircraft, electricity is the most effective and sustainable power source. Electric aviation, however, is still relatively new, and there are limitations with electric power, such as battery size, energy density, and charging. This paper dives deeper into the applications and factors to consider for the implementation of electric aircraft into the current society, as well as a potential solution to accelerate the process. Specifically, our research finds that hydrogen fuel cells, despite a few limitations, provide the amount of energy necessary to develop capable and sustainable electric aircraft in a manner that may be the most feasible."

582,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220015374,2023-08-03,22” ADP Fan Rig Liners Design Report,"A liner design study was conducted as part of a cooperative effort between five (5) government/industry teams that together seek to demonstrate the technology for designing and manufacturing acoustic liners that are twenty five percent (25%) more efficient than 1992 technology liners. The study emphasized teaming collaboration. The improved liners were designed by Pratt & Whitney and Boeing Airplane Company and built by Rohr Inc, and will be tested in the NASA/P& W 22-inch ADP fan rig at NASA Lewis Research Center's 9' x 15' wind tunnel. Design guidelines and decisions were made collectively during monthly design review telecons and at the formal final design review.

The tools that were used to design the new improved liners were not new, but the process that was developed as part of this study that led into the evaluation and selection of the final and best liner designs is new. Until now, the liner design process as practiced by different industry teams varied greatly. Some procedures were based on empirical liner attenuation databases which could not adequately account for engine-to-engine hardwall fan noise spectral differences, while others were entirely theoretical. And regardless of which method one chose, the major difficulty was still the lack of understanding and knowledge of the actual hardwall fan source noise modal structure and farfield SPL spectra. The NASA-led effort to attempt actual measurements of the fan source noise modal structure by means of the rotating microphone array is expected to contribute significantly to the understanding of the nature of the fan tone noise modes, but the application to broadband noise is still a long way off. The new design process included consideration of the measured fan tone modes, but for the majority of the spectra a separate, systematic process was used.

It is a common practice in the engine/nacelle industry that acoustic liners for new products are designed before actual measured hardwall engine far-field noise spectra are available. Target noise spectra are normally derived from existing engine noise databases with some adjustments to absolute SPLs and frequencies. This practice has been acceptable as long as the new engine was a derivative of the base engine. However, in the case of the ADP, the transition from a current engine base is too - great, and the adjustments could not adequately account for the quantum changes in SPL spectral differences. Examples were the 1992 single degree of freedom (SDOF) inlet and aft liners (designed by P&W) that would be used as the baseline liners against which the new improved liners' efficien¬cies would -be measured. As will be shown, these baseline liners have been found to be deeper than the desire optimum depths.

The new liner design process begins with the selection of the target hard wall fan noise spectra. These spectra were obtained by scaling up (5.91 scale factor) the measured hardwall fan spectral data from the 22” ADP fan rig. Next, the modal energy contents for each 1/3-octave band center frequency of these hardwall fan noise spectra are estimated. (Within each 1/3-octave band center frequency, the model energy distribution approximation is for both tone and broadband noise).

For the inlet noise, P&W uses a derivative of the NASA Lewis (Ed Rice's) method of classifying; and grouping propagating modes by their cutoff ratios. The next step is to assign energy level to each group of modes having the same cutoff ratio. In Ed Rice's model, the modes were grouped according to ten (10) cutoff ratio intervals with center values located at 1.026, 1.085, 1.155, 1.24, 1.35, 1.49, 1.69, 2.0,  and 4.47 (with equal number of modes in each interval). The modes were assumed to have equal energy. P&W’s model expands the cutoff ratio-mode grouping into two hundred (200) smaller cutoff ratio intervals with center values located f1"".'m 1.003 to 11.5 in 199 increasing incremental intervals. Next, P&W's model uses a ""2-parameter"" normal distribution as a template to assign energy levels to these 200 pre-determined cutoff ratio values (for each 1/3-octave band center frequency). In the past, P&W had conducted an extensive study to determine what ""2-parameter"" values are appropriate for fullscale inlet liners, and had developed a set of twenty-four (24) ""2-pararneter"" values (i.e. one for each 1/3-octave frequency band) that when used in Ed Rice's Inlet Attenuation Prediction Method produced predicted liner attenuations that closely matched measured liner attenuations from several P&W's engines. In the absence of actual measured tone and broadband modal data from the 22"" ADP rig, the process will use P&W's proprietary set of ""2-parameter"" values for this liner design study.

For the aft noise, Boeing uses a modal energy approximation that the ""transport energy"" of each propagating mode is equal. This approximation is almost the same as the equal energy per mode approximation, except for modes that are near cutoff. Boeing's model forces these modes to have lower energy levels. Both P&W and Boeing agreed that the ""transport energy"" approximation should work well for the ADP aft fan noise which appears to be dominated by broadband noise.

The design process then proceeds to calculate the optimum liner impedances for each frequency in both the inlet and the aft. These optimum impedances represent the target impedances that the designed liners should have. Liners with impedances matching the optimum impedances at all frequencies are ""ideal"" liners. These ideal liners are theoretically the best liners. Unfortunately, it has been showed that it is impossible to design and build such ideal liners. The next best liners are ones that have impedances matching the optimum impedances over some frequency range (not all frequencies as for the ideal). This is accomplished by the use of ""frequency weightings"". Several of P&W's and Boeing's existing computer decks were used for optimizing and matching the designed liner impedances to the target optimum values (with the various frequency weightings specified). The optimization produces liner candidates with predicted liner impedances and descriptions of their physical liner characteristics. These candidate liner impedances are then used to predict their spectral attenuation characteristics which are then used together with the target hardwall fan noise spectra to determine the resulting treated noise spectra and PNLT values. Further optimization around the selected candidate designs yield final designs that are best in PNLT attenuations. Use of the optimization decks allowed a large number of liner candidates to be screened in a relatively short period of time. This design process is systematic and is efficient.

The new inlet SDOF liner design obtained from the improved process was predicted to be 34% more effective (per unit area) than the 1992 baseline inlet liner. This inlet liner design is a 112 rayl wovenwiremesh facesheet over a 0.312-inch deep honeycomb core. The new aft SDOF liner design was predicted to be 52% more efficient than the aft baseline liner. The new aft SDOF liner is ""segmented"" with a shallower liner on the core cowl (inner duct wall) and a deeper liner on the fan cowl (outer duct wall). The shallower liner is a 70.6 rayl woven-wiremesh facesheet over a 0.141-inch deep honeycomb core. The deeper liner is a 68 rayl woven-wiremesh facesheet over a 0.309-inch deep honeycomb core. All liner dimensions are for the 22-inch model-scale ADP fan rig liners.

The selected advanced liners are ""segmented"" double-layer (DDOF) liners for the inlet and aft locations. Also, for the inlet, a bulk liner with ceramic foam for wider broadband noise absorption was also selected. Triple-layer liner designs were not considered since the model scaled liners ( 1/5. 91) were dimensionally too small to be built correctly, and irrin earlier concept study, Boeing found a triple-layer to have only very small benefits over a double-layer. The inlet DDOF liner was predicted to be 83% more effective than the baseline. The inlet DDOF design is a 78 rayl facesheet over a 0.080 top cavity depth, a 68 rayl septum and a 0.227-inch bottom cavity depth. The inlet bulk liner is a 60 rayl facesheet over a 0.33-inch deep honeycomb filled with high temperature (HTP) ceramic foam with a density of 4.8 lb/cu.ft and a flow resistivity of 167 rayl/cm. The inlet bulk liner was predicted to be 83% more effective than the baseline liner. The aft DDOF liners are segmented with a shallower liner on the core cowl and a deeper liner on the fan cowl. The shallow DDOF liner is a 49.8 rayl facesheet over a 0.093-inch top cavity depth, a septum of 88.2 rayls over a 0.181-inch bottom cavity depth. The deep DDOF liner is a 12.9 rayl facesheet over a 0.140-inch top cavity depth, a septum of 53.1 ray ls over a 0.258-inch botom cavity depth. The segmented aft DDOF liners were predicted to be 86% more efficient than the baseline liner."

Although turbidity and TSS have been moderately improving over the past few decades, poor water quality is detrimental to the Chesapeake Bay’s ecosystems and the surrounding watersheds. The Summer 2022 Chesapeake Bay Water Resources project observed sediment dynamics and turbidity in the York River watershed using remote sensing tools, models, and Earth observations including NASA and United States Geological Survey’s (USGS) Landsat satellite series, NASA DEVELOP’s Optical Reef Coastal Area Assessment Tool 2.0 (ORCAA), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The collaborators on this project were the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (CBNERR), Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AquaWatch, the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites Coastal Observations, Applications, Services and Tools (CEOS COAST), and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VA DEQ). The team concluded that the upstream sections of the York River watershed increased in TSS from 2009–2019. However, the seasonal TSS patterns often correlated with higher precipitation levels, although not necessarily major storm events. This may be due to factors like wind and waves contributing to the sedimentation trends observed. Although projects have been conducted to improve water quality, additional efforts like planting riparian buffers along areas with high TSS are needed to reduce the intensity of runoff. The team’s results will allow the end user, the VA DEQ, to inform their policymaking regarding future Bay conservation efforts."

during COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 compared to 2019. We apply these estimates to
quantify NO2 changes in more than 200 cities, including 65 cities without available
ground monitoring, largely in lower-income regions. Mean country-level
population-weighted NO2 concentrations are 29% ± 3% lower in countries with strict
lockdown conditions than in those without. Relative to long-term trends, NO2
decreases during COVID-19 lockdowns exceed recent Ozone Monitoring Instrument
(OMI)-derived year-to-year decreases from emission controls, comparable to 15 ± 4
years of reductions globally. Our case studies indicate that the sensitivity of NO2 to
lockdowns varies by country and emissions sector, demonstrating the critical need
for spatially resolved observational information provided by these satellite-derived
surface concentration estimates."

The motivation for this semantics will be first the replacement of possible worlds with the idea of an ``agent perspective''. After exploring some of the philosophical implications of such a move, we give a semantics based around this idea. Following this, we explore some of the more interesting consequences of such a system, in particular the soundness of an unusual axiom we call NU^*. After giving soundness and completeness, we conclude by exploring ways to weaken this axiom in our semantics."

The losses caused by wildfires could be mitigated if high-risk areas, hotspots, and flare-ups could be monitored continuously, such as through the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This paper documents exploratory efforts using machine learning to determine efficient flight paths for UAVs and to detect wildfires using image classification. On path planning, three machine learning techniques—Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Dynamic Programming—were explored. Genetic Algorithm was found to be an effective approach for path planning for wildfire monitoring and surveillance by UAVs. For a scenario of 25 locations in a circular arrangement, the algorithm was able to return the optimal path. The accuracy and execution time was found to be sensitive to the algorithm hyperparameters selected, which was especially evident in scenarios with hundreds or thousands of locations. Simulated Annealing was also found to be an effective approach for UAV path planning, with a major benefit of avoiding getting trapped in local minima and being straightforward to implement. Like Genetic Algorithm, the performance of Simulated Annealing was also found to be sensitive to the algorithm hyperparameters selected. By comparison, Dynamic Programming guarantees optimality for any number of locations, but it was found to be less practical in terms of execution time for scenarios with more than about a couple dozen locations. On wildfire detection, image classification using deep learning with a convolutional neural network was explored. Transfer learning was found to be a useful technique to efficiently train deep learning models. Also, it was determined that GPU processing can increase training speed by an order of magnitude, which enables significantly faster development. For a validation test set of 500 images, there were only two false negatives and zero false positives. These results demonstrate that detecting wildfires in static cameras using machine learning is feasible and establish a baseline for using images captured by UAVs in flight for wildfire detection."

of predictive models that can improve decision making, decrease computational cost, and improve
efficiency in a variety of fields. As an organization begins to develop and implement such models, the
data used in the training, validation, and testing of ML models, the model parameters, and the use cases or limitations of the models must be properly stored to ensure models are both fully traceable and used correctly. In the context of predicting material behavior, advances in computationally intense, physics-based modeling of material behavior at various length scales and the emergence of Integrated
Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) have driven the need for developing data-driven surrogate
models of the physics-based simulation tools using ML techniques. Surrogate model development allows for accurate material behavior prediction at a fraction of the cost of its physics-based counterpart, allowing for multiscale simulations of real-world applications, further enabling the ability to design fit-for-purpose materials for a reasonable computational investment. However, training such models requires extensive data, and thus, effective data management is necessary to reach the full potential that ML can offer to material design and ICME.

This paper proposes a generalized, robust schema that allows organizations to store both real
(experimental) and virtual (simulation) data used to train ML models and the defining model parameters
and architectures within the Granta MI Platform. The developed schema allows for various types of data
inputs and outputs, including single point values, time-series data, and images that can be used in the
prediction of material behavior, while following outlined best practices for effective data management.
An effective schema for ML data and models can help prevent the recreation of virtual/real training data
and surrogate models, help reduce the time to create new models similar to existing ones by offering a
starting point in the hyperparameter determination stages, minimize resources devoted to verification and validation (V&V) and certification of models, and ensure that data and surrogate models are not misused due to full traceability of both the data and ML model. It also allows organizations access to models that have already been developed, such that they can be used in the design of new materials, enabling the overall goals of ICME."

This Epoch of Heating (EoH; z ∼10–15) should soon be detected via the redshifted 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen, allowing us to indirectly study the properties of HMXBs in the unseen, first galaxies. Low-redshift observations, as well as theoretical models, imply that the integrated X-ray luminosity to star formation rate of HMXBs (L_X/SFR) should increase in metal-poor environments, typical of early galaxies. Here, we study the impact of the metallicity (Z) dependence of L_X/SFR during the EoH. For our fiducial models, galaxies with star formation rates of order 10^(−3)–10^(−1)M_⊙ yr^(−1) and metallicities of order 10^(−3) –10^(−2) Z_⊙ are the dominant contributors to the X-ray background (XRB) during this period. Different L_X/SFR–Z relations result in factors of ∼ 3 differences in these ranges, as well as in the mean IGM temperature and the large-scale 21-cm power, at a given redshift. We compute mock 21-cm observations adopting as a baseline a 1000 h integration with the upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) for two different L_X/SFR–Z relations. We perform inference on these mock observations using the common simplification of a constant L_X/SFR, finding that constant L_X/SFR models can recover the IGM evolution of the more complicated L_X/SFR–Z simulations only during the EoH. At z < 10, where the typical galaxies are more polluted, constant L_X/SFR models overpredict the XRB and its relative contribution to the early stages of the reionization."

UAM is a subset of the Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) concept under development by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and industry.

The Strategic Conflict Management (SCM) Simulation, dubbed “X4”, was conducted between July 2021 and June 2022 by NASA with the FAA and industry to evolve the Provider of Services for UAM (PSU) that will be needed to ensure initial UAM operations can scale in the National Airspace System (NAS). The FAA UAM Concept of Operations (ConOps) v1 [1] served as an initial guiding document for the X4 airspace management system design to ensure the architecture supports testing of services provided by third-party service providers. To that end, the X4 architecture leveraged concepts and technologies developed for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) while also developing and testing new capabilities and services needed for UAM. The architecture included an initial prototype of the FAA-Industry Exchange Protocol (FIDXP), third-party services such as the PSUs, and Discovery and Synchronization Service (DSS), and other new services such as Demand-Capacity Balancing (DCB) to facilitate UAM strategic conflict management.

During X4, NASA led discussions and collaborated with seven industry airspace partners to develop initial airspace management concepts for UAM that drove what would be tested and evaluated during the simulations. The initial capabilities defined for PSU leveraged UTM UAS Service Supplier (USS) as a starting point and evolved to meet UAM requirements. These discussions were also an opportunity for NASA to collaborate with industry to develop a set of initial Community-Based Rules (CBRs). These CBRs enabled how UAM traffic would be cooperatively managed among UAM operators. The collaborative, iterative process of developing CBRs with industry during X4 provided insight into the challenges involved and identified the need for a suitable and effective forum for future CBR development.

In parallel with these discussions, NASA conducted a series of seven software sprints and two collaborative simulations with the airspace partners that built up in complexity. Over the course of the year, all seven partners successfully completed all the sprints by demonstrating the required capabilities. They also participated in the two collaborative simulations to demonstrate how multiple PSUs could work together in a collaborative, more complex environment with higher traffic density.

The X4 simulation accomplished NASA's objectives and helped advance the development of the seven participating PSUs. The lessons learned provided insight into key elements of the UAM Notional Architecture from the FAA ConOps v1 [1] and UTM technologies when applied to UAM:
 - Having a Concept of Use (ConUse) defined prior to the activity would accelerate the time and effort from concept development to testing.
 - While the UAM Notional Architecture provided a starting point for a federated architecture that support services provided by third-party providers, the USS and PSU differed in their capability definitions for operational intent submission and sharing, conformance monitoring, airspace authorization, strategic conflict management, airspace constraints and dynamic replanning.
 - While existing DSS developed for UTM provided a way for PSU and other UAM services (such as DCB) to discover relevant operations from each other, additional complexity and challenges were found during X4 testing and illuminated the need for a more suitable solution for UAM.

Industry can leverage the results of this demonstration to accelerate UAM requirements, CBRs, and standards development. The FAA and other government municipalities and agencies will be able to leverage results to inform future policies and identify additional gaps that require further analysis, moving toward operationalization of UAM."

Understanding our Sun and its interior is one of the major goals of the NASA Science program. Still this is a very difficult task because very little makes it directly out of the Sun’s interior. The energy we see today, that warms the Earth, was made 50,000 to 80,000 years ago and is only now coming to the surface to make light. However, neutrinos penetrate matter almost without interaction and make it to Earth in only eight minutes from creation. Since neutrinos interact only weakly they are hard to detect; never-the-less within the last ten years neutrino detectors on Earth have started to reliably detect neutrinos from the fusion reactions in the interior of the Sun and scientists have started to use this information to investigate the Sun’s nuclear furnace.

Changes in solar neutrino flux make it advantageous to take a neutrino detector into space since the solar neutrino intensity changes dramatically as the inverse square of the distance from the Sun, by five orders of magnitude when going from the Earth to the Sun. Launch of a neutrino detector into space toward the Sun will: a) aim to significantly increase the neutrino flux 10,000x allowing for a smaller detector which improves detector energy resolution and performance, b) attempt to completely eliminate background terrestrial neutrino sources for improved measurement accuracy, and c) conduct unique science experiments near the Sun not achievable with much larger detectors on the Earth.

NASA's interest in deep space exploration has been a key factor in its unmanned spacecraft development and launch of exploration science satellites and spacecraft. NASA has done exceptional experiments in space where science benefits from the unique platform of spacecraft that provides unprecedented views. For example, the Hubble Space Telescope is really a small and very common instrument, but when it is put into an orbit high above the Earth, it becomes one of the most powerful optical observatories man has ever made. Moving neutrino observations to space is the next obvious step.

The concept of putting a neutrino detector in close orbit of the sun is completely unexplored and innovative. Its scientific return is to vastly enhance the understanding of the solar interior which is a NASA major goal as stated in the decadal survey. Preliminary calculations show that such a spacecraft if properly shielded, can operate in this environment both taking data of neutrino interactions which can be distinguished from random background rates of solar Electromagnetic emissions, Galactic charged cosmic-ray, and gamma-rays by using a double pulsed signature. The NIAC Phase-1 simulations have shown this idea to be very successful in eliminating background and identifying the neutrino interaction signal, hence this spacecraft detector concept once demonstrated to be Technical Readiness Level 7 and flight mission-ready would enable a whole new type of mission to explore and study our Sun, in details that could neither be done with the largest neutrino detectors on Earth nor other types of space-craft measurements that are not using neutrino detection.

Our goal in this NIAC Phase-2 was to take the detector simulation ideas and construct a prototype for testing in the lab with tagged sources to evaluate and demonstrate that the performance in the simulations are borne out by a prototype."

2021 at Wilson Corners, Solid Waste Management Unit (SWMU) 001, at Kennedy Space Center
(KSC), Florida. The site is monitored under KSC’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) Corrective Action Program. Adaptive site management is being utilized through
ongoing assessment, design, and interim measures (IM). Annual LTM of the groundwater is also
being conducted at the site. This approach also meets the requirements of Chapter 62-780,
Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.). 

The goal of LTM at this site is threefold: to determine groundwater flow characteristics, monitor the downgradient concentration trends, and monitor select locations internal to the groundwater plume. Every 5 years, upgradient and side-gradient monitoring wells are sampled to verify delineation. The last time this was performed was in 2015. The sampling of these wells in 2020 was replaced with the direct push technology (DPT) investigations completed in October 2020 and April 2021. This DPT groundwater data was presented in an Advance Data Package (ADP) in September 2021 and discussed in the Implementation Work Plan (IWP) dated November 2021 for installation of an air sparge (AS) system. Based on results from groundwater sampling activities performed during the previous reporting period, including the 2020 and 2021 DPT groundwater sampling, it was determined that the LTM sampling plan was no longer meeting the goal of LTM because delineation was not verified. The 2021 LTM sampling plan was modified to include the sampling of monitoring wells located around the perimeter of the low concentration plume (LCP); the area with concentrations of contaminants of concern [COCs] greater than Groundwater Cleanup Target Levels [GCTLs]), and sampling of 10 monitoring wells proposed for installation (April 2021 KSC Remediation Team (KSCRT) Meeting, Decision 2104-D32). The modified LTM plan received team consensus at the September 2021 KSCRT Meeting (Decision Number 2109-D03), and sampling of the existing monitoring wells was completed in December 2021. The proposed monitoring wells are planned for installation in late 2022, concurrent with ongoing IM construction activities. December 2021 LTM data was presented at the May 2022 KSCRT Meeting, and activities are summarized in this report.

The activities presented in this report include the December 2021 groundwater gauging of 42
monitoring wells and sampling of 44 monitoring wells. During the December 2021 event, the
low flow sampling method was used, and samples were analyzed for a select list of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs), including 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (Freon 113).

The following conclusions can be made based on the 2021 LTM results:
 - In December 2021, groundwater flow for the site was generally to the west at all intervals.
This is generally consistent with historical observations at the site, with the exception of a
southwest and southeast flow component observed at 34 to 48 feet below land surface (bls). 
 - The vertical extent of VOCs was historically delineated by monitoring wells screened greater
than 48 feet bls. The results from the two vertical extent monitoring wells, WILC-MW0078
(screened 65 to 70 feet bls) and WILC-MW0130 (screened 56 to 66 feet bls) that were
sampled during the 2021 LTM indicate that groundwater vinyl chloride (VC) concentrations
in both wells were greater than the GCTL. The Remediation Team has previously agreed to
delay deeper DPT investigations in this area to prevent the creation of additional pathways
for vertical migration.
 - The LCP continues to extend both horizontally, predominantly to the west, and vertically
beyond the current monitoring well network, with some retraction observed to the southeast.
Evaluation of this data combined with data from the 2020 and 2021 DPT sampling event
indicate that the LCP encompasses an estimated 20.7 acres based on an expanded sampling
area, as compared to the 2020 LCP footprint of 17.0 acres. 
 - Freon 113 was not detected above GCTLs during the 2021 LTM event.

Based on groundwater sampling activities performed in 2021, including April 2021 DPT
groundwater sampling, the following recommendations are provided:
 - Perform the next LTM sampling event, targeted to occur in 2023, concurrently with the IM
baseline sampling prior to AS system installation; 
 - Include sampling from nine monitoring wells that are planned to be installed in late 2022,
concurrent with upcoming IM construction activities. Installation of one deep vertical well,
screened 70 to 80 feet bls, will be delayed to prevent the creation of an additional pathway
for vertical migration; 
 - Continue to sample under the modified annual LTM plan as presented in Table 4-1
concurrently with IM baseline sampling; and
 - Once the AS system install and start-up is complete, select monitoring wells from the LTM
program will transition into the performance monitoring plan, and LTM will be temporarily
discontinued. Performance monitoring will be performed quarterly, and the monitoring well
network will be evaluated following the first performance monitoring sampling event."

Microgreens are good candidates for food supplements and contain specific nutrients that are lacking in the prepackaged diet, including vitamin C and vitamin K. Because they are densely sown, typical growth methods do not allow the ability to distinguish between the levels of evaporation from the rooting substrate and transpiration from the leaves. With larger plants, the root and shoot zone can be separated to distinguish these fluxes and accurate transpiration measurements of plant canopies are feasible. Furthermore, separation of the root and shoot zone may also be beneficial when harvesting microgreens in microgravity as it may reduce microbial contamination of the edible biomass by the roots, which have high microbial loads. Using a root and shoot separator box when harvesting may help with microbial contamination, but these tiny plants are challenging to handle in microgravity, so harvest management remains an open question.

The innovation proposed here is a microgreen root/shoot partitioned planting box, which offers a solution to these challenges with accurate gas exchange measurements and a safe microgreen harvest in low gravity environments. Being able to measure transpiration of a microgreen canopy will be important for modeling plant growth in reduced gravity environments, so the first objective was to develop a planting unit with a seal between the root zone and the shoot zone. With an unsuitable harvesting technique, freshly harvested microgreens may add debris to the cabin, so the second objective was to test different harvesting techniques and management approaches associated with this innovation. These two objectives were pursued in parallel since many goals were the same: develop a planting unit that 1) separates the shoots from the roots, 2) allows acceptable germination rate, and 3) allows for seedlings to emerge and develop. What differed was the need to have a seal, which was only applicable for our gas exchange goal, and the need to have an embedded harvesting mechanism and bagging method which only applied to our harvesting goal.

Testing of the various harvesting mechanisms and bagging methods was performed during a series of parabolic flights. All parabolic flight procedures took place inside a rented secondary containment chamber (e.g., glovebox) that was developed by the University of Louisville specifically for experiments involving fluids and other materials that may become airborne during reduced gravity flight. Three different harvesting methods and two different bagging collection methods were tested for microgreens. A third bagging method was initially tested but found to be unsuitable. Human factors were also taken into consideration, to identify which harvest and bagging collection methods would be easiest to use with favorable results in microgravity. Three parabolic flight tests were performed in total, one in November 2021 and two in December 2021."

Here we examine the roles of sea surface temperature (SST) and meteorological factors in controlling the mesoscale morphology and evolution of shallow clouds associated with a cold-air outbreak that occurred on 1 March 2020 during phase I of the Aerosol Cloud Meteorology Interactions over the Western Atlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE). Our results show that the simulated PFC structure and ambient conditions by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model are generally consistent with observations from GOES-16 and dropsonde measurements. We also examine the thermodynamical and dynamical influences in the cloud mesoscale morphology using WRF sensitivity experiments driven by two meteorological forcing datasets with different domain-mean SST and spatial gradients, which lead to dissimilar values of hydrometeor water path and cloud core fraction. The SST from ERA5 leads to weaker stability and higher inversion height than the SST from FNL does. In addition, the use of large-scale meteorological forcings from ERA5 yields a distinctive time evolution of wind direction shear in the inner domain, which favors the formation and persistence of longer cloud rolls. Both factors contribute to a change in the time evolution of domain-mean water path and cloud core fraction of cloud streets. Our study takes advantage of the simulation driven by the differences between two large-scale forcing datasets to illustrate the importance of SST and wind direction shear in the cloud street morphology in a realistic scenario"

A recent study showed how on-planet observations near the center of the 15 micron CO2band by the A3 channel(635–665 cm−1)of the Mars Climate Sounder on board Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO-MCS) could sense horizontally short, vertically broad gravity waves at≈25 km above the surface by looking at small-scale radiance variability in temperature-sensitive channels.  This approach is extended here to two additional channels closer to the wings of the 15 micron CO2band,A1 (595–615 cm−1) and A2 (615–645 cm−1), to sense gravity waves throughout the lower atmosphere.  Using information from all three channels demonstrates that gravity wave activity in Mars’s lowermost atmosphere is dominated by orographic sources,  particularly over the extremely rough terrain of Valles Marineris.  Much of this orographic population is either trapped or filtered in the lowest two scale heights, such that variations in filtering and non-orographic sources shape the gravity wave population observed at 25 km above the surface. During global dust storms,  however,  gravity wave activity in the first scale height decreases by approximately a factor of two, yet trapping/filtering of what activity remains in the tropics substantially weakens.  Exceptionally high radiance variability at night in the tropics during the less dusty part of the year is the result of observing mesospheric clouds rather than gravity waves."

These instruments, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), provide valuable observations to investigate the interconnections between Earth's land, atmosphere, ocean, snow and ice, and energy balance, and have yielded the first global and seasonal measurements of the Earth system for long-term monitoring of climate and environmental change. Over the past 20 years and with more than 100,000 orbits, Terra’s observations have greatly enhanced our understanding of the Earth's climate and the effects of human activity and natural disasters on communities and ecosystems."

This coupled modeling framework builds on the linkage between land surface models (LSMs), which simulate surface boundary conditions in atmospheric models, and distributed hydrologic models, which simulate horizontal surface and sub-surface flow, adding new land DA capabilities. In the present study, we employ this modeling framework in the Tuolumne River basin in central California. We demonstrate the added value of the assimilation of NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates in the Tuolumne basin. This analysis is performed in both LIS as an LSM column model and LIS/WRF-Hydro, with hydrologic routing. Results demonstrate that ASO DA in the basin reduced snow bias by as much as 30% from an open-loop (OL) simulation compared to three independent datasets. It also reduces downstream streamflow runoff biases by as much as 40%, and improves streamflow skill scores in both wet and dry years. Analysis of soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) also reveals the impacts of hydrologic routing from WRF-Hydro in the simulations, which would otherwise not be resolved in an LSM column model. By demonstrating the beneficial impact of SWE DA on the improving streamflow forecasts, the article outlines the importance of such observational inputs for reservoir operations and related water management applications."

The MODIS and MISR instruments on the Terra platform, combined with their continuous operation, broad spectral coverage, and different spatial resolutions, have played an important role to achieve the goals of the EOS. Over two decades of successful operations, these multispectral imaging instruments have benefited a variety of scientific applications. Being on the same platform, the two sensors complement each other in terms of spatial coverage (and target viewing geometry) and facilitate synergistic applications using multispectral data. A consistent radiometric calibration between these sensors is a prerequisite for creating high quality science products from their observations. Both instruments underwent intensive prelaunch characterization and their on-orbit calibrations are monitored using their onboard calibrators. In this paper, we perform a calibration inter-comparison of the spectrally matching bands of the two instruments using vicarious techniques. These techniques include multiyear simultaneous views of the North African desert, North Atlantic Ocean, and Dome Concordia, therefore covering different reflectance regimes. Also included in this work are the near-simultaneous top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance measurements from Railroad Valley, USA, as provided by the RadCalNet (converted to TOA), that are used as a calibration reference to compare the on-orbit observations between MODIS and MISR. Simultaneous overpasses from desert, ocean, Dome C, and RadCalNet over Railroad Valley reveal that the agreement between the four spectrally matching bands is within 3% for the time-period between 2014 and 2020. Also, observed are some long-term drifts in the TOA reflectance time-series from MISR for the red and NIR band that are expected to be corrected in a future calibration reprocess."

The National Academies have prioritized the pursuit of new scientific discoveries using diverse and temporally coordinated measurements from multiple ground and space-based observatories. Networked communications can enable such measurements by connecting individual observatories and allowing them to operate as a cohesive and purposefully designed system. Timely data flows across terrestrial and space communications networks are required to observe transient scientific events and processes. Currently, communications to space-based observatories experience large latencies due to manual service reservation and scheduling procedures, intermittent signal coverage, and network capacity constraints. If space communications network latencies could be reduced, new discoveries about dynamic scientific processes could be realized. However, science mission and network planners lack a systematic framework for defining, quantifying and evaluating timely space data flow implementation options for transient scientific observation scenarios involving multiple ground and space-based observatories. This dissertation presents a model-based systems engineering approach to investigate and develop network solutions to meet the needs of transient science space systems.

First, a systematic investigation of the current transient science operations of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) space 
data network and the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory resulted in a formal architectural model for transient science space systems. Two methods individual missions may use to achieve timely 
network services were defined, quantitatively modeled, and experimentally compared. 

Next, the architectural model was extended to describe two alternative ways to achieve timely and autonomous space data flows to multiple space-based observatories within the context of a purposefully designed transient science observation scenario. A quantitative multipoint space data flow modeling method based in queueing theory was defined. General system suitability metrics for timeliness, throughput, and capacity were specified to support the evaluation of alternative network data flow implementations. A hypothetical design study was performed to demonstrate the multipoint data flow modeling method and to evaluate alternative data flow implementations using TDRS. The merits of a proposed future TDRS broadcast service to implement multipoint data flows were quantified and compared to expected outcomes using the as-built TDRS network. 

Then, the architectural model was extended to incorporate commercial network service providers. Quantitative models for Globalstar and Iridium short messaging data services were developed based on publicly available sources. Financial cost was added to the set of system suitability metrics. The hypothetical design study was extended to compare the relative suitability of the as-built TDRS network with the commercial Globalstar and Iridium networks. 

Finally, results from this research are being applied by NASA missions and network planners. In 2020, Swift implemented the first automated command pipeline, increasing its expected gravitational wave follow-up detection rate by greater than 400%. Current NASA technology initiatives informed by this research will enable future space-based observatories to become interoperable sensing devices connected by a diverse ecosystem of network service providers."

However, the atmospheric abundance of dust is unconstrained in cirrus-forming regions, hampering our ability to predict these radiatively important clouds. Here we present global-scale measurements of dust aerosol abundance in the upper troposphere and incorporate these into a detailed cirrus-formation model. We show that dust aerosol initiates cirrus clouds throughout the extra-tropics in all seasons and dominates cirrus formation in the Northern Hemisphere (75–93% of clouds seasonally). Using a global transport model with improved dust treatment, we also explore which of Earth’s deserts are the largest contributors of dust aerosol to cirrus-forming regions. We find that the meteorological environment downstream of each emission region modulates dust atmospheric lifetime and transport efficiency to the upper troposphere so that source contributions are disproportionate to emissions. Our findings establish the critical role of dust in Earth’s climate system through the formation of cirrus clouds."

LunaNet will start with a simple architecture of a few nodes to meet the needs of the early missions and evolve to meet the growing needs of a sustained lunar presence.

Reactivation of Epstein Barr virus (EBV), VZV, HSV-1, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) is typically asymptomatic during spaceflight, though live/infectious virus has been recovered and the shedding rate increases with mission duration. The risk of clinical disease, therefore, may increase for astronauts assigned to extended missions (>180 days). Here, we report, for the first time, a case of HSV-1 skin rash (dermatitis) occurring during long-duration spaceflight. The astronaut reported persistent dermatitis during flight, which was treated onboard with oral antihistamines and topical/oral steroids. No HSV-1 DNA was detected in 6-month pre-mission saliva samples, but on flight day 82, a saliva and rash swab both yielded 4.8 copies/ng DNA and 5.3 × 104 copies/ng DNA, respectively. Post-mission saliva samples continued to have a high infectious HSV-1 load (1.67 × 107 copies/ng DNA). HSV-1 from both rash and saliva samples had 99.9% genotype homology. Additional physiological monitoring, including stress biomarkers (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and salivary amylase), immune markers (adaptive regulatory and inflammatory plasma cytokines), and biochemical profile markers, including vitamin/mineral status and bone metabolism, are also presented for this case. These data highlight an atypical presentation of HSV-1 during spaceflight and underscore the importance of viral screening during clinical evaluations of in-flight dermatitis to determine viral etiology and guide treatment."

carrying out a number of simulations with compressible and incompressible driving conditions. We use two
approaches to determine the presence of fast modes: mode decomposition based on spatial variations only and
spatio-temporal 4D fast Fourier transform (4D FFT) analysis of all fluctuations. The latter method enables us to
quantify fluctuations that satisfy the dispersion relation of fast modes with finite frequency. Overall, we find that
the fraction of fast modes identified via the spatio-temporal 4D FFT approach in total fluctuation power is either
tiny with nearly incompressible driving or ∼2% with highly compressible driving. We discuss the implications of
our results for understanding the compressible fluctuations in space and astrophysical plasmas."

Here we analyze the latest climate model projections of precipitation and temperature for the very high emissions scenario, SSP5-8.5,to detect potential future changes in this region. A baseline period (1981-2010) is compared with the middle(2040-2069) and end (2070-2099) of the 21stcentury. The results, representing the worst-case scenario, identify the Tigris-Euphrates headwaters as the hotspot of future compounding effects of climate change in the Middle East. Those effects result from the coincidence of elevated temperature, reduced precipitation, and enhanced interannual variability of precipitation. The hotspot overlays the location of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (in Turkish, GAP) irrigation initiative. In this climate context, risks to GAP viability and downstream water security, and associated potential for water-related conflicts and migration are considerable and demand a reconsideration of the risk-benefit assessment of GAP. This need has become more urgent after the recent widespread and deadly climate-related conflicts and wildfires in summer 2021 across the Middle East that further underlined vulnerability of the region to climate extremes."

We have compiled a catalog of 393 members of Corona Australis, (39 at >M6), 293 (36) of which are spectroscopically classified for the first time in this work. We find that Corona Australis can be described in terms of two stellar populations, a younger one (a few megayears) that is partially embedded in the cloud (the Coronet Cluster) and an older one (∼15 Myr) that surrounds and extends beyond the cloud (Upper Corona Australis). These populations exhibit similar space velocities, and we find no evidence for distinct kinematic populations in Corona Australis, in contrast to a recent study based on Gaia DR2. The distribution of spectral types in Corona Australis reaches a maximum at M5 (∼0.15 M⊙), indicating that the initial mass function has a similar characteristic mass as other nearby star-forming regions. Finally, we have compiled mid-infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the Spitzer Space Telescope for the members of Corona Australis, and we have used those data to identify and classify their circumstellar disks.

Twenty DESIS images were used from three widely separated forested study sites representing deciduous and conifer forests. Gross primary production (GPP) values from eddy covariance flux towers at the sites were matched with DESIS spectral reflectances collected on the same days. Multiple algorithms were successful relating spectral reflectance with GPP, including: spectral vegetation indices (SVI) sensitive to chlorophyll content, SVI used in a photosynthetic light-use efficiency model framework, spectral shape characteristics through spectral derivatives and absorption feature analysis, and statistical models leading to multiband hyperspectral indices from partial least squares regression. Successful algorithms were able to achieve R2 better than 0.7 using a diverse set of observations combining data from different sites from multiple years and at multiple times during the year.

The two outer planets have periods of 56 . 0067 ±0 . 0003 d and 84 . 2597 + 0 . 0010 −0 . 0008 d, which implies a period ratio very close to that of the first-order 3:2 mean motion resonance, exciting transit timing variations (TTVs) of up to 60 min. These two planets were first identified by TESS , and we identified a third planet in the TESS photometry with a period of 22 . 8911 ±0 . 0004 d. We confirm the planetary nature of all three planetary candidates using ground-based photometry from Hazelwood , ASTEP , and LCO , including a full detection of the ∼9 h transit of HD 28109 c from Antarctica. The radii of the three planets are R b = 2 . 199 + 0 . 098 −0 . 10 R ⊕, R c = 4 . 23 ±0 . 11 R ⊕, and R d = 3 . 25 ±0 . 11 R ⊕; we characterize their masses using TTVs and precise radial velocities from ESPRESSO and HARPS, and find them to be M b = 18 . 5 + 9 . 1 −7 . 6 M ⊕, M c = 7 . 9 + 4 . 2 −3 . 0 M ⊕, and M d = 5 . 7 + 2 . 7 −2 . 1 M ⊕, making planet b a dense, massive planet while c and d are both underdense. We also demonstrate that the two outer planets are ripe for atmospheric characterization using transmission spectroscopy, especially given their position in the CVZ of James Webb Space Telescope . The data obtained to date are consistent with resonant (librating) and non-resonant (circulating) solutions; additional observations will show whether the pair is actually locked in resonance or just near-resonant."

The Gl 486 system consists of a very nearby, relatively bright, weakly active M3.5V star at just 8 pc with a warm transiting rocky planet of about 1.3 <i>R</i><sub>⨁</sub> and 3.0 <i>M</i><sub>⨁</sub>. It is ideal for both transmission and emission spectroscopy and for testing interior models of telluric planets.

<i>Aims</i>. To prepare for future studies, we aim to thoroughly characterise the planetary system with new accurate and precise data collected with state-of-the-art photometers from space and spectrometers and interferometers from the ground. 

<i>Methods</i>. We collected light curves of seven new transits observed with the CHEOPS space mission and new radial velocities obtained with MAROON-X at the 8.1m Gemini North telescope and CARMENES at the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope, together with previously published spectroscopic and photometric data from the two spectrographs and TESS. We also performed near-infrared interferometric observations with the CHARA Array and new photometric monitoring with a suite of smaller telescopes (AstroLAB, LCOGT, OSN, TJO). This extraordinary and rich data set was the input for our comprehensive analysis.

<i>Results</i>. From interferometry, we measure a limb-darkened disc angular size of the star Gl 486 at θ<sub>LDD</sub> = 0.390 ± 0.018 mas. Together with a corrected Gaia EDR3 parallax, we obtain a stellar radius <i>R</i><sub>*</sub> = 0.339 ± 0.015 <i>R</i><sub>⨀</sub>. We also measure a stellar rotation period at <i>P</i><sub>rot</sub> = 49.9 ± 5.5 days, an upper limit to its XUV (5–920 Å) flux informed by new Hubble/STIS data, and, for the first time, a variety of element abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, V, Sr, Zr, Rb) and C/O ratio. Moreover, we imposed restrictive constraints on the presence of additional components, either stellar or sub-stellar, in the system. With the input stellar parameters and the radial-velocity and transit data, we determine the radius and mass of the planet Gl 486 b at <i>R</i><sub>p</sub> = 1.343<sup>+0.063</sup><sub>-0.062</sub> <i>R</i><sub>⨀</sub> and <i>M</i><sub>p</sub> = 3.00<sup>+0.13</sup><sub>-0.13</sub> <i>M</i><sub>⨁</sub>, with relative uncertainties of the planet radius and mass of 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively. From the planet parameters and the stellar element abundances, we infer the most probable models of planet internal structure and composition, which are consistent with a relatively small metallic core with respect to the Earth, a deep silicate mantle, and a thin volatile upper layer. With all these ingredients, we outline prospects for Gl 486 b atmospheric studies, especially with forthcoming <i>James Webb Space Telescope (Webb)</i> observations."

To make followup observations more uniform and efficient, we develop a system, HighMagFinder, to automatically alert possible ongoing high-magnification events based on the real-time data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). We started a new phase of follow-up observations with the help of HighMagFinder in 2021. Here we report the discovery of two planets in high-magnification microlensing events, KMT- 2021-BLG-0171 and KMT-2021-BLG-1689, which were identified by the HighMagFinder. We find that both events suffer the ‘central-resonant’ caustic degeneracy. The planet-host mass-ratio is <i>q</i> ∼4.7 × 10<sup>−5</sup> or <i>q</i> ∼2.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> for KMT-2021-BLG-0171, and <i>q</i> ∼2.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> or <i>q</i> ∼1.8 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for KMT-2021-BLG-1689. Together with two other events, four cases that suffer such degeneracy have been discovered in the 2021 season alone, indicating that the de generate solutions may have been missed in some previous studies. We also propose a quantitative factor to weight the probability of each solution from the phase space. The resonant interpretations for the two events are disfavoured under this consideration. This factor can be included in future statistical studies to weight degenerate solutions."

As the most water-rich body in the inner solar system, it is a representative of a population of planetesimals that were likely a significant source of volatiles and organics to the inner solar system. Here we describe possible medium-class (around $1 billion) mission concepts that would determine both Ceres' origin and its current habitability potential. Habitability is addressed through a combination of geological, geophysical, and compositional investigations by (i) searching for evidence from orbit of past and ongoing geological activity near landforms interpreted as brine-driven volcanic structures and (ii) probing the brine distribution below one of these regions with electromagnetic sounding (in situ). Two approaches were considered for compositional measurements, which address both habitability and origins: (1) in situ exploration at two sites and (2) sample return from a single site. Both concepts targeted material at Occator crater, which is one of the youngest features on Ceres (∼20 Ma) and a site rich in evaporites evolved from recently erupted brine sourced from a region >35 km deep. We conclude that a sample return architecture from these young evaporite deposits offers greater science return by enabling high-resolution analysis of organic matter (trapped in salt minerals) and isotopes of refractory elements for a similar cost and less science risk than in situ analyses. This manuscript describes the six science objectives and the two implementation concepts considered to achieve those objectives."

The mission constraints for these types of missions are expected to be progressively challenging for integration of Human Systems requirements into the vehicle and mission architectures. Mass and volume allocations are expected to become increasingly restrictive at the same time that mission realities will drive an increasing need for crew self-sufficiency in the maintenance and repair of both vehicle systems and human systems. To meet these challenges, a systematic, traceable, and repeatable approach to identifying, defining, and prioritizing medical capabilities is required. To provide a systematic and repeatable approach to defining and prioritizing clinical capabilities for spaceflight medicine, a clear process is required for delivering a list of prioritized medical capabilities to the Systems Engineering process that will delineate the mass, power, volume, and similar needs and the trade space analysis for a given space vehicle and mission architecture."

A multi-center team at NASA recently considered multiple different refrigeration cycles and refrigeration integration methodologies and how these might fit into early liquefaction plants for NASA's exploration initiatives. The rate of liquefaction for these initiatives is quite slow in comparison to large scale terrestrial applications. These studies concluded that, for both structural and heat spreading reasons, integrating the refrigeration tubing on the surface of the storage tank wall is an attractive path to pursue in the near term. In order to develop a technology development path and inform investors, it was desired to investigate the sensitivity of gravity of the processes involved. 

An analysis of the condensation processes within the tank is performed.  The objective is to determine the sensitivity of liquefaction to gravitational effects. The heat transfer mechanisms include forced convection heat removal to the refrigeration system (or cryocooler), conduction through the tank wall heat exchanger, and convection and condensation on the inner tank wall. Gravity affects the liquefaction process via condensate liquid drainage, natural convection in the ullage, and the shape of the liquid-vapor interface within the tank. Analysis of these mechanisms shows that while there is some sensitivity to gravitational level in general, within the bounds of current interest (rate of liquefaction appropriate to Lunar and Martian applications, and cooling capacity of the cryocooler), this sensitivity of liquefaction to gravity is quite small.  Thus, system level testing on the Earth should suffice for the performance prediction and demonstration of liquefaction operations as applicable to Lunar and Martian applications."

The goal of this paper is to begin the discovery of the fundamental underlying mathematical structure of space networks to help the research community harness these structures for algorithm development and optimization. To ensure the applicability of the research, the approaches are considered through the lens of simulated scenarios inspired by the Artemis Back-to-the-Moon mission set for 2024.

We note that any approach to an SSI must fit under the umbrella of Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN), due to celestial mobility, high link latencies, high variance in link latencies, disconnections, lack of end-to-end paths, and so on. These difficulties are exacerbated by the fact that the underlying structure of a space network is a time-evolving network and may experience multiple discontinuities in its topology.

In this paper we propose several novel approaches to a mathematical foundation for Delay Tolerant Networking Theory that fall outside the traditional scope of temporal network theory. These techniques include methods from Topological Data Analysis, Dynamic Graph Analysis, Applied Algebraic Geometry, Probability Theory, and Game Theory. Some of these methods include tools adapted to the study of dynamic metric spaces, such as zigzag persistent homology and their higher parameter analogs. We find that several of these methods target desired engineering outcomes such as discovery and automatic sub-netting. While each approach is theoretical, they are also algorithmic in nature and offer immediate practical applications. The paper concludes with comparisons of the various methods along with suggestions for future work."

These ion impacts on airless bodies play an important role in altering their surface properties and surrounding environment. Much of the collisional sputtering data needed for exosphere studies come from binary collision approximation (BCA) sputtering models. These depend on the surface binding energy (SBE) for the atoms sputtered from the impacted material. However, the SBE is not reliably known for many materials important for planetary science, such as plagioclase feldspars and sodium pyroxenes. BCA models typically approximate the SBE using the cohesive energy for a monoelemental solid. We use molecular dynamics (MD) to provide the first accurate SBE data we are aware of for Na sputtered from the above silicate minerals, which are expected to be important for exospheric formation at Mercury and the Moon. The MD SBE values are ∼8 times larger than the Na monoelemental cohesive energy. This has a significant effect on the predicted SW ion sputtering yield and energy distribution of Na and the formation of the corresponding Na exosphere. We also find that the SBE is correlated with the coordination number of the Na atoms within the substrate and with the cohesive energy of the Na-bearing silicate. Our MD SBE results will enable more accurate BCA predictions for the SW ion sputtering contribution to the Na exosphere of Mercury and the Moon."

At NASA, AI has become an integral and important tool for researchers, engineers, data scientists, and technologists in pursuing the ground-breaking discoveries that we are known for, including the command and controlling of our spacecraft and other supporting infrastructures. Consequently, research and engineering efforts incorporating AI have permeated almost every area of our work. It is contributing to NASA’s drive toward the future, not just of space science, but for society here at home. We are dedicated to continuing the use of AI in a safe and fully transparent approach so that the public can have high confidence in the outcomes and benefits. We believe that the plan outlined here will be responsive and contribute to the call for openness across the federal government.

NASA is committed to responsible use of AI in all of its activities and in all phases of development and deployment of its space and terrestrial programs missions. NASA does not deliberately focus on “AI Research” as a separate field (we have no single “AI office” or “AI program”), rather NASA uses AI to build tools for its programs. This plan, being put forward, adheres to the Responsible AI (RAI) principles set and laid down by the White House in its Presidential Executive Order 13960. Our research, engineering and technical communities have been made aware of these guidelines and we are committed to an on-going process of educating and monitoring its implementation to ensure adherence to those principles.

The distribution of CO2 can be used as a proxy for the residual circulations. Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) CO2 volume mixing ratio (VMR) and temperature measurements from 2003 to 2020 are used to study the monthly climatology of MLT residual circulations and the mesopause height. Our analyses show that (a) mesopause height strongly correlates with the CO2 VMR vertical gradient during solstices; (b) mesopause height has a discontinuity at midlatitude in the summer hemisphere, with a lower mesopause height at mid-to-high latitudes as a result of adiabatic cooling driven by strong adiabatic upwelling; (c) the residual circulations have strong seasonal variations at mid-to-high latitudes, but they are more uniform at low latitudes; and (d) the interannual variability of the residual circulations and mesopause height is larger in the Southern Hemisphere (SH; 4–5 km) than in the Northern Hemisphere (NH; 0.5–1 km)."

The goal of this study is to develop an alternative technique for retrieving MABL-specific humidity (q) using GNSS-RO data in deep-refracted signals. The GNSS-RO signal amplitude (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio or SNR) at the deep straight-line height (H(SL)) was been found to be strongly impacted by water vapor within the MABL. This study presents a statistical analysis to empirically relate the normalized SNR (S(RO)) at deep HSL to the MABL q at 950 hPa (~400 m). When compared to the ERA5 reanalysis data, a good linear q–S(RO) relationship is found with the deep H(SL) S(RO) data, but careful treatments of receiver noise, SNR normalization, and receiver orbital altitude are required. We attribute the good q–S(RO) correlation to the strong refraction from a uniform, horizontally stratiform and dynamically quiet MABL water vapor layer. Ducting and diffraction/interference by this layer help to enhance the S(RO) amplitude at deep H(SL). Potential MABL water vapor retrieval can be further developed to take advantage of a higher number of S(RO) measurements in the MABL compared to the Level-2 products. A better sampled diurnal variation of the MABL q is demonstrated with the S(RO) data over the Southeast Pacific (SEP) and the Northeast Pacific (NEP) regions, which appear to be consistent with the low cloud amount variations reported in previous studies."

While their total area of Greenland ice cover is relatively small (4%), their mass loss is disproportionally large compared to the Greenland ice sheet. Satellite altimetry from Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and ICESat-2 shows that mass loss from Greenland's peripheral glaciers increased from 27.2 ± 6.2 Gt/yr (February 2003–October 2009) to 42.3 ± 6.2 Gt/yr (October 2018–December 2021). These relatively small glaciers now constitute 11 ± 2% of Greenland's ice loss and contribute to global sea level rise. In the period October 2018–December 2021, mass loss increased by a factor of four for peripheral glaciers in North Greenland. While peripheral glacier mass loss is widespread, we also observe a complex regional pattern where increases in precipitation at high altitudes have partially counteracted increases in melt at low altitude."

While previous investigations using remote sensing and numerical simulations strongly suggest that this mixing is tidally driven, the impacts of monsoon and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on tidal mixing in the Indonesian seas must play an important role. Here we use high-resolution sea surface temperature from June 2002 to June 2021 to reveal monsoon and ENSO modulations of mixing. The largest spring-neap (fortnightly) signals are found to be localized in the narrow passages/straits and sills, with more vigorous tidal mixing during the southeast (boreal summer) monsoon and El Niño than that during the northwest (boreal winter monsoon) and La Niña. Therefore, tidal mixing, which necessarily responds to seasonal and interannual changes in stratification, must also play a feedback role in regulating seasonal and interannual variability of water mass transformations and Indonesian throughflow. The findings have implications for longer-term variations and changes of Pacific–Indian ocean water mass transformation, circulation, and climate."

A better representation of soil moisture would improve coupled carbon–water dynamics in terrestrial ecosystem models and could potentially improve model estimates of large-scale carbon fluxes and climate feedbacks. Here, we investigate using soil moisture observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission to inform simulated carbon fluxes in the global terrestrial ecosystem model LPJ-wsl. Results suggest that the direct insertion of SMAP reduces the bias in simulated soil moisture at in situ measurement sites by 40%, with a greater improvement at temperate sites. A wavelet analysis between the model and measurements from 26 FLUXNET sites suggests that the assimilated run modestly reduces the bias of simulated carbon fluxes for boreal and subtropical sites at 1–2-month time scales. At regional scales, SMAP soil moisture can improve the estimated responses of CO2 and CH4 fluxes to extreme events such as the 2018 European drought and the 2019 rainfall event in the Sudd (Southern Sudan) wetlands. The simulated improvements to land–surface carbon fluxes using the direct insertion of SMAP are shown across a variety of timescales, which suggests the potential of SMAP soil moisture in improving the model representation of carbon–water coupling."

The altitude-integrated enhancement (AIE) derived from the Arctic Carbon Atmospheric Profiles (Arctic-CAP) project demonstrates the utility of this bulk quantity for surface flux model evaluation. This bulk quantity leverages background mole fraction values from the middle free troposphere, is agnostic to uncertainties in boundary layer height, and can be derived from model estimates of mole fractions and vertical gradients. To demonstrate the utility of the bulk quantity, six airborne profiling surveys of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO) throughout Alaska and northwestern Canada between April and November 2017 were completed as part of NASA’s Arctic–Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE). The Arctic-CAP sampling strategy involved acquiring vertical profiles of CO2, CH4, and CO from the surface to 5 km altitude at 25 sites around the ABoVE domain on a 4- to 6-week time interval. All Arctic-CAP measurements were compared to a global simulation using the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) modeling system. Comparisons of the AIE bulk quantity from aircraft observations and GEOS simulations of atmospheric CO2, CH4, and CO highlight the fidelity of the modeled surface fluxes. The model–data comparison over the ABoVE domain reveals that while current state-of-the-art models and flux estimates are able to capture broad-scale spatial and temporal patterns in near-surface CO2 and CH4 concentrations, more work is needed to resolve fine-scale flux features that are captured in CO observations"

The instruments’ calibration accuracy has been maintained, even with instrument degradation. Electronic crosstalk in the thermal emissive bands (TEB) is a known issue with an increasing impact on the calibration and product. The Terra MODIS photovoltaic (PV) longwave infrared (LWIR) bands crosstalk corrections have been applied in Collection 6.1 (C6.1).  However, the electronic crosstalk contamination for some detectors in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) bands and the Aqua PVLWIR bands affect the Level-1B (L1B) product’s measurement accuracy and image quality. In Collection 7 (C7), crosstalk corrections for select detectors in the Terra and Aqua MWIR and Aqua PV LWIR bands are applied. The entire mission crosstalk coefficients for the select detectors and bands are derived from scheduled lunar observations and populated in the form of look-up tables (LUTs). The Aqua PV-LWIR bands exhibit similar downward crosstalk trends as the Terra PV-LWIR bands, especially in recent years.  The crosstalk coefficients and their trends provide a guideline for the correction application. Earth measurement analyses before and after the correction provide contamination and correction assessments.  It has been shown that the product quality is enhanced with the crosstalk correction applied in C7. For C7, the crosstalk coefficient uncertainty is derived from the fit residuals between the measured values and a linear fit over a three-year sliding window. The uncertainty propagation is modeled and applied in the total uncertainty calculation intheL1B product. The TEB electronic crosstalk LUTs have been processed over the entire Terra and Aqua MODIS missions. This paper presents the C7 crosstalk correction, as well as its assessment and uncertainty propagation algorithm to the TEB uncertainty."

Biodiversity, forage availability, and cattle health are all affected by rangeland management. Virtual fencing is a tool that rangeland managers can use to potentially increase biodiversity and improve ranching operations. NASA DEVELOP and Colorado State University (CSU) collaborated with the Nature Conservancy (TNC), and Red Top Ranch to demonstrate the efficacy of virtual fencing. We sought to identify annual and monthly biomass patterns on the ranch through the creation of monthly max biomass productivity maps. We utilized a dataset from the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) to calculate biomass on the ranch. To validate our remotely-sensed results, we compared model-predicted biomass values to field-collected biomass clipping data and an additional biomass dataset from the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP). We used satellite imagery from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 9 –OLI-2, and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) for 2021 and 2022. We found that there was heterogeneity in biomass across the ranch, with higher biomass on the western side. The highest peak of biomass was in the summer months, with a smaller peak in mid-September. The ARS biomass dataset had a significant relationship with RAP for 2021. ARS biomass did not have a significant relationship with the biomass field data collected in 2022.

The NASA Langley Research Center Supersonic Low Disturbance Tunnel is capable of providing a Mach 3.5 flow with low freestream acoustic noise and low turbulence levels.  Measurements made with a hot-wire probe downstream of the roughness element showed the presence of instability modes that did not cause transition in the measurement region at a freestream unit Reynolds number of Re =12.6×10^6/m. The largest amplitude mode appeared to be similar to a symmetric mode. The same roughness patch immersed in a higher freestream acoustic noise environment showed little to no evidence of the instability modes. Instead, disturbances found in the boundary layer matched closely to the freestream spectra measured in the empty tunnel under the same conditions, indicating some evidence of freestream forcing in the boundary layer."

The differences between the types of observed clouds suggest a complex interplay between the dynamics and chemistry at play on these atmospheres. Particularly, the stark difference between the banded structures of Jupiter and Saturn, vs the sporadic clouds on the ice giants highlights the varieties in dynamic, chemical and thermal processes that shape these atmospheres. Since the early explorations of these planets by spacecrafts, such as Voyager and Voyager 2, there are many outstanding questions about the long term stability of the observed features. One hypothesis is that the internal heat generated during the formation of these planets is transported to the upper atmosphere through latent heat release from convecting clouds (i.e., moist convection). In this review, we present evidences of moist convective activity on the gas giant atmospheres of our Solar System from remote sensing data, both from ground- and space-based observations. We detail the processes that drive moist convective activity, both in terms of the dynamics as well as the microphysical processes that shape the resulting clouds. Finally, we also discuss the effects of moist convection on shaping the large scale dynamics (such as jet structures on these planets)."

However, achieving metal selectivity solely through a three-dimensional protein structure is a great challenge, because there is a limited set of metal-coordinating amino acid functionalities and proteins are inherently fexible, which impedes steric selection of metals3,4 . Metal-binding afnities of natural proteins are primarily dictated by the electronic properties of metal ions and follow the Irving–Williams series5 (Mn2+ < Fe2+ < Co2+ < Ni2+  Zn2+) with few exceptions6,7 . Accordingly, metalloproteins overwhelmingly bind Cu2+ and Zn2+ in isolation, regardless of the nature of their active sites and their cognate metal ions1,3,8 . This led organisms to evolve complex homeostatic machinery and non-equilibrium strategies to achieve correct metal speciation1,3,8–10. Here we report an artifcial dimeric protein, (AB)2, that thermodynamically overcomes the Irving–Williams restrictions in vitro and in cells, favouring the binding of lower-Irving–Williams transition metals over Cu2+, the most dominant ion in the Irving–Williams series. Counter to the convention in molecular design of achieving specifcity through structural preorganization, (AB)2 was deliberately designed to be fexible. This fexibility enabled (AB)2 to adopt mutually exclusive, metal-dependent conformational states, which led to the discovery of structurally coupled coordination sites that disfavour Cu2+ ions by enforcing an unfavourable coordination geometry. Aside from highlighting fexibility as a valuable element in protein design, our results illustrate design principles for constructing selective metal sequestration agents."

The addressed aspects include the reconnection electric field, the reconnection rate, and the electron and the ion outflow speeds. In the shock transition region, many current sheets are generated in shock-driven turbulence, and electron-only reconnection and reconnection where both ions and electrons are involved can occur in those current sheets. The electron outflow speed in electron-only reconnection shows a positive correlation with the theoretical speed, which is close to the local electron Alfvén speed, and a strong convection electric field is generated by the large electron outflow. As a result, the reconnection electric field becomes much larger than those in the standard magnetopause or magnetotail reconnection. In shock-driven reconnection that involves ion dynamics, both electron outflows and ion outflows can reach of the order of 10 times the Alfvén speed in the X-line rest frame, leading to a reconnection electric field the same order as that in electron-only reconnection. An electron-only reconnection event observed by the magnetospheric multiscale mission downstream of a quasi-parallel shock is qualitatively similar to those in the simulation and shows that the outflow speed reaches approximately half the local electron Alfvén speed, supporting the simulation prediction."

Astrophysicists often search for QPOs with frequency-domain methods such as(Lomb–Scargle)periodograms, which generally assume power-law models plus some excess around the QPO frequency. Time-series data can alternatively be investigated directly in the time domain using Gaussian process(GP)regression.While GP regression is computationally expensive in the general case, the properties of astrophysical data andmodels allow fast likelihood strategies. Heteroscedasticity and nonstationarity in data have been shown to causebias in periodogram-based analyses. GPs can take account of these properties. Using GPs, we model QPOs as astochastic process on top of a deterministicflare shape. Using Bayesian inference, we demonstrate how to infer GPhyperparameters and assign them physical meaning, such as the QPO frequency. We also perform model selectionbetween QPOs and alternative models such as red noise and show that this can be used to reliablyfind QPOs. Thismethod is easily applicable to a variety of different astrophysical data sets. We demonstrate the use of this methodon a range of short transients: a gamma-ray burst, a magnetarflare, a magnetar giantflare, and simulated solarflare data."

Many imaging and spectroscopic observations across the electromagnetic spectrum were obtained prior to, during, and subsequent to this dimming event. These observations of Betelgeuse reveal that a substantial surface mass ejection (SME) occurred and moved out through the extended atmosphere of the supergiant. A photospheric shock occurred in 2019 January–March, progressed through the extended atmosphere of the star during the following 11 months and led to dust production in the atmosphere. Resulting from the substantial mass outflow, the stellar photosphere was left with lower temperatures and the chromosphere with a lower density. The mass ejected could represent a significant fraction of the total annual mass-loss rate from the star suggesting that episodic mass-loss events can contribute an amount comparable to that of the stellar wind. Following the SME, Betelgeuse was left with a cooler average photosphere, an unusual short photometric oscillation, reduced velocity excursions, and the disappearance of the∼400 day pulsation in the optical and radial velocity for more than two years following the Great Dimming."

Correlation lengths are grouped by an interval’s alignment angle; the angle between the magnetic-field and solar wind velocity vectors (ΘBV). Parallel and perpendicular angular channels correspond to angles 0° < ΘBV < 40° and 50° < ΘBV < 90°, respectively. We observe an anisotropy in the inner heliosphere within 0.40 au, with  l l »^ 0.75 C C at 0.10 au. This anisotropy reduces with increasing heliocentric distance and the correlation lengths roughly isotropize within 1 au. Results from ACE and WIND support a reversal of the anisotropy, such that  l l »^ 1.29 C C at 1 au. The ratio does not appear to change significantly beyond 1 au, although the small number of parallel intervals in the Voyager data set precludes unambiguous conclusions from being drawn. This study provides insights regarding the radial evolution of the large, most energetic interacting turbulent fluctuations in the heliosphere. We also emphasize the importance of tracking the changes in sampling direction in PSP measurements
as the spacecraft approaches the Sun, when using these data to study the radial evolution of turbulence. This can prove to be vital in understanding the more complex dynamics of the solar wind in the inner heliosphere and can assist in improving related simulations."

These proteins constitute excellent model systems to investigate how evolution relates to structure, folding, and function. Here, we propose a scheme to map evolutionary information at the sequence level to a coarse-grained model for repeat-protein folding and use it to investigate the folding of thousands of repeat proteins. We model the energetics by a combination of an inverse Potts-model scheme with an explicit mechanistic model of duplications and deletions of repeats to calculate the evolutionary parameters of the system at the single-residue level. These parameters are used to inform an Ising-like model that allows for the generation of folding curves, apparent domain emergence, and occupation of intermediate states that are highly compatible with experimental data in specific case studies. We analyzed the folding of thousands of natural Ankyrin repeat proteins and found that a multiplicity of folding mechanisms are possible. Fully cooperative all-or-none transitions are obtained for arrays with enough sequence-similar elements and strong interactions between them, while noncooperative element-by-element intermittent folding arose if the elements are dissimilar and the interactions between them are energetically weak. Additionally, we characterized nucleation-propagation and multidomain folding mechanisms. We show that the global stability and cooperativity of the repeating arrays can be predicted from simple sequence scores."

The space-borne radiometer era provided observations in short timescales from minutes to years. Therefore, this study presents an overview of irradiance observations, highlighting the importance of following its variability in different time scales.

In this work, we introduce a constant-turn flux rope model and use it to simulate the 2012 July 12 16:48 CME in the inner heliosphere. We constrain the initial parameters of this CME using the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model and the reconnected flux in posteruption arcades. We correctly reproduce all the magnetic field components of the CME at Earth, with an arrival time error of approximately 1 hr. We further estimate the average subjective uncertainties in the GCS fittings by comparing the GCS parameters of 56 CMEs reported in multiple studies and catalogs. We determined that the GCS estimates of the CME latitude, longitude, tilt, and speed have average uncertainties of 5°.74, 11°.23, 24°.71, and 11.4%, respectively. Using these, we have created 77 ensemble members for the 2012 July 12 CME. We found that 55% of our ensemble members correctly reproduce the sign of the magnetic field components at Earth. We also 
determined that the uncertainties in GCS fitting can widen the CME arrival time prediction window to about 12 hr for the 2012 July 12 CME. On investigating the forecast accuracy introduced by the uncertainties in individual GCS parameters, we conclude that the half-angle and aspect ratio have little impact on the predicted magnetic field of the 2012 July 12 CME, whereas the uncertainties in longitude and tilt can introduce relatively large spread in the magnetic field predicted at Earth."

We focus on their dependence with heliolongitude relative to the source region of their associated CMEs, and with CME speed, for events observed in Solar Cycle 24 at the STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and/or ACE spacecraft. We find that observations of ESP events at 1 au are organized by longitude relative to their CME solar source. The ESP event longitude distribution also showed organization with CME speed. The near-Sun CME speeds (V<sub>i</sub>) for these events ranged from ∼560 to 2650 km s<sup>−1</sup> while the average CME transit speeds to 1 au were significantly slower. The angular width of the events had a clear threshold at V<sub>i</sub> of ∼1300 km s<sup>−1</sup>, above which events showed significantly larger angular extension compared to events with speeds below. High-speed events also showed larger heavy ion peak intensities near the nose of the shock compared to the flanks while their spectral index was smaller near the nose and larger near the flanks. This organization for events with V<sub>i</sub> < 1300 km s<sup>−1</sup> was not as clear. These ESP events were observed over a narrower range of longitudes though the heavy ion peak intensities still appeared largest near the nose of the shock. Their heavy ion spectra showed no clear organization with longitude. These observations highlight the impact of spacecraft position relative to the CME source longitude and Vi on the properties of ESP events at 1 au."

The MC is characterized by a quasi-three-dimensional(3D) flux rope model based on in situ measurements from the Wind spacecraft. The contents of the magnetic flux and other parameters are quantified. In addition, a correlative study with the corresponding measurements of the same structure crossed by the Venus Express (VEX)spacecraft at a heliocentric distance of 0.7 au and with an angular separation of∼6°in longitude is performed to validate the MC modeling results. The spatial variation between the Wind and VEX magnetic field measurements is attributed to the3D configuration of the structure appearing as a knotted bundle of flux. A comparison of the magnetic flux contents between the MC and the preexisting MFR on the Sun indicates that the 3D reconnection process accompanying anM1.9flare may correspond to the magnetic reconnection between the field lines of the preexisting MFR rooted in the opposite polarity foot points. Such a process reduces the amount of the axial magnetic flux in the erupted flux rope, by approximately 50%, in this case."

Methane venting and flaring are primary contributors to offshore emissions, and monitoring these activities is crucial for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Limited ground truthing and intermittent offshore satellite revisits make monitoring venting and flaring challenging. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) oversee offshore oil and gas activity but rely primarily on operator-reported data. The non-profit organization SkyTruth monitors natural resources like methane and identifies sources of fugitive emissions. By combining BOEM and BSEE’s operational data along with observations from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 9 OLI-2, and PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA), the team further identified ultra-emitter point sources in the Gulf of Mexico using sunglint-configured imagery. We quantified these plume emission rates using the methodology from Varon et al. (2020). The team found three plumes in the Gulf of Mexico occurring between 2020 and 2022 using Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 9 OLI-2 imagery, in addition to the single plume identified by the Gulf of Mexico Health & Air Quality I team, and successfully quantified three plumes. Our statistical retrieval of three PRISMA images tasked over areas of interest yielded no methane plumes, despite a successful test of a known plume in Assam, India. These analyses serve as a proof of concept for the utility of remote sensing for methane emission monitoring offshore, which can complement regulator emission inventories and validate self-reported operator records."

Wave reflections caused by density variations are also a key uncertainty in the retrieval of ice sheet temperature profiles in Ultra-Wide band radiometry. In this paper, we examine different firn density profile models and analyze the subsurface reflections they cause using an analytical partially coherent approach. We also examine firn density profiles obtained from borehole measurements, from past UWBRAD modeling studies, from a community firn model, and from snow radar echo measurements. In previous studies, the ice sheet has been model as a 1D random medium with density variations in depth. However, horizontal density variations also exist, so that the ice sheet is a 3D random medium. Analyses using the partially coherent model show that in the presence of horizontal fluctuations, contributions from short scale variations vanish as the horizontal correlation length decreases due to the diffraction of waves."

I. Survey Overview and Methods,"We give an overview and describe the rationale, methods, and testing of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Archival Legacy project ""SKYSURF."" SKYSURF uses HST's unique capability as an absolute photometer to measure the ∼0.2–1.7 μm sky-surface brightness (sky-SB) from 249,861 WFPC2, ACS, and WFC3 exposures in ∼1400 independent HST fields. SKYSURF's panchromatic data set is designed to constrain the discrete and diffuse UV to near-IR sky components: Zodiacal Light (ZL), Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), and the discrete plus diffuse Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). We outline SKYSURF's methods to: (1) measure sky-SB levels between detected objects; (2) measure the discrete EBL, most of which comes from AB≃17–22 mag galaxies; and (3) estimate how much truly diffuse light may exist. Simulations of HST WFC3/IR images with known sky values and gradients, realistic cosmic ray (CR) distributions, and star plus galaxy counts were processed with nine different algorithms to measure the ""Lowest Estimated Sky-SB"" (LES) in each image between the discrete objects. The best algorithms recover the LES values within 0.2% when there are no image gradients, and within 0.2%–0.4% when there are 5%–10% gradients. We provide a proof of concept of our methods from the WFC3/IR F125W images, where any residual diffuse light that HST sees in excess of zodiacal model predictions does not depend on the total object flux that each image contains. This enables us to present our first SKYSURF results on diffuse light in Carleton et al."

It was assumed that these impulsive structures observed by the MMS spacecraft originally were created because of the reconnection at the magnetopause. Our new 3-D hybrid kinetic modeling on the large time and spatial scales captures several of these processes: an excitation of the electromagnetic waves (whistler and shear-Alfvén waves) and plasma instabilities (mirror and flute); a formation of shock waves, and collapsing diamagnetic cavity; particle acceleration. A strong overshoot in plasma density profile was observed in the modeling and MMS observation at the interface between the cloud and magnetospheric plasma. The cloud expansion into ambient magnetospheric plasma causes the flute waves connected with excitation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability observed at the overshoot in plasma density profile across the external magnetic field. The modeling demonstrates a formation of the whistler waves at the initial stage which propagate in the external magnetic field direction. At the later stage, a formation of shear-Alfvén waves was observed"

A Technical Overview of the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic Survey,"The COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY) is designed to provide the community with a spectral atlas of 45 nearby star-forming galaxies that were chosen to cover similar properties to those seen at high z (z > 6). The prime high-level science product of CLASSY is accurately coadded UV spectra, ranging from ∼1000 to 2000 Å, derived from a combination of archival and new data obtained with HST's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). This paper details the multistage technical processes of creating this prime data product and the methodologies involved in extracting, reducing, aligning, and coadding far-ultraviolet and near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectra. We provide guidelines on how to successfully utilize COS observations of extended sources, despite COS being optimized for point sources, and best-practice recommendations for the coaddition of UV spectra in general. Moreover, we discuss the effects of our reduction and coaddition techniques in the scientific application of the CLASSY data. In particular, we find that accurately accounting for flux calibration offsets can affect the derived properties of the stellar populations, while customized extractions of NUV spectra for extended sources are essential for correctly diagnosing the metallicity of galaxies via C iii] nebular emission. Despite changes in spectral resolution of up to ∼25% between individual data sets (due to changes in the COS line-spread function), no adverse affects were observed on the difference in velocity width and outflow velocities of isolated absorption lines when measured in the final combined data products, owing in part to our signal-to-noise regime of S/N < 20."

Ice crystals and water droplets inherently exhibit different characteristics in different precipitation regimes (e.g., convection, stratiform), which reflect on satellite remote sensing measurements that help us distinguish them. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory’s microwave imager (GMI) and dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) together provide ample information on global precipitation characteristics. As an active sensor, the DPR provides an accurate precipitation type assignment, while passive sensors such as the GMI are traditionally only used for empirical understanding of precipitation regimes. Using collocated precipitation type flags from the DPR as the “truth”, this paper employs machine learning (ML) models to train and test the predictability and accuracy of using passive GMI-only observations together with ancillary information from a reanalysis and GMI surface emissivity retrieval products. Out of six ML models, four simple ones (support vector machine, neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting) and the 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) model are identified to produce 90–94% prediction accuracy globally for five types of precipitation (convective, stratiform, mixture, no precipitation, and other precipitation), which is much more robust than previous similar effort. One novelty of this work is to introduce data augmentation (subsampling and bootstrapping) to handle extremely unbalanced samples in each category. A careful evaluation of the impact matrices demonstrates that the polarization difference (PD), brightness temperature (Tc) and surface emissivity at high-frequency channels dominate the decision process, which is consistent with the physical understanding of polarized microwave radiative transfer over different surface types, as well as in snow and liquid clouds with different microphysical properties. Furthermore, the view-angle dependency artifact that the DPR’s precipitation flag bears with does not propagate into the conical-viewing GMI retrievals. This work provides a new and promising way for future physics-based ML retrieval algorithm development."

The detection and characterization of exoplanets and brown dwarfs around massive AF-type stars is essential to investigate and constrain the impact of stellar mass on planet properties. However, such targets are still poorly explored in radial velocity (RV) surveys because they only feature a small number of stellar lines and those are usually broadened and blended by stellar rotation as well as stellar jitter. As a result, the available information about the formation and evolution of planets and brown dwarfs around hot stars is limited.
<p style=""text-indent: 0px;"">Aims. We aim to increase the sample and precisely measure the masses and eccentricities of giant planets and brown dwarfs transiting early-type stars detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).

We followed bright (V < 12 mag) stars with T<sub>eff</sub> > 6200 K that host giant companions (R > 7 R<sub>⊕</sub>) using ground-based photometric observations as well as high precision radial velocity measurements from the CORALIE, CHIRON, TRES, FEROS, and MINERVA-Australis spectrographs.

In the context of the search for exoplanets and brown dwarfs around early-type stars, we present the discovery of three brown dwarf companions, TOI-629b, TOI-1982b, and TOI-2543b, and one massive planet, TOI-1107b. From the joint analysis of TESS and ground-based photometry in combination with high precision radial velocity measurements, we find the brown dwarfs have masses between 66 and 68 M<sub>Jup</sub>, periods between 7.54 and 17.17 days, and radii between 0.95 and 1.11 R<sub>Jup</sub>. The hot Jupiter TOI-1107b has an orbital period of 4.08 days, a radius of 1.30 R<sub>Jup</sub>, and a mass of 3.35 M<sub>Jup</sub>. As a by-product of this program, we identified four low-mass eclipsing components (TOI-288b, TOI-446b, TOI-478b, and TOI-764b).

TOI-629 is among the hottest stars with a known transiting brown dwarf. TOI-629b and TOI-1982b are among the most eccentric brown dwarfs. The massive planet and the three brown dwarfs add to the growing population of well-characterized giant planets and brown dwarfs transiting AF-type stars and they reduce the apparent paucity."

The compact IRCSP is sensitive to linearly polarized long-wave infrared (LWIR) light between 7-12 micron and targets cloud micro-physical properties. Post landing the instrument was retrieved with no damage to the optical payload and collected over 150 minutes of flight data at altitudes above 30 km. The results collected both demonstrate the application of uncooled microbolometers in the low pressure environment and represent the first know field evidence of a polarized signal from clouds in the LWIR. During deployment, the IRCSP reported brightness temperatures between 250-285K with uncertainty of < 1.5K. In addition, multiple intervals of statistically significant polarization with degrees of linear polarization (DoLP) between 1−20% were detected. These results support the hypothesis that the LWIR polarimetry has the potential to add new sensitivity to existing remote sensing platforms."

This study provides a temporal radiometric stability and calibration consistency assessment of the SNPP and NOAA20 VIIRS reflective solar bands using the latest NASA SIPS C2 L1B products. Several independent vicarious approaches are used to examine the stability of SNPP VIIRS and consistency of the at-sensor reflectance between the two VIIRS instruments. These approaches include observations from simultaneous nadir overpasses, the Libya-4 desert and Dome C snow/ice sites, and deep convective clouds. The impact of existing band spectral differences on the reflectance measurements is accounted for utilizing scene-specific hyperspectral observations provided by the SCIAMACHY sensor onboard the ENVISAT platform. Results indicate that both SNPP and NOAA20 VIIRS reflectances are stable within 1% over their mission periods for all bands, except for a few bands in the visible range from SNPP VIIRS that show more upward drifts at high radiances. NOAA20 VIIRS reflectances are systematically lower than SNPP by 2 to 4% for most bands, with the exception of few short wavelength bands where it is seen to be up to 7%."

However, it has now become a growing ecological and economic threat in grasslands of several states in the U.S. southern Great Plains including Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. Here, we demonstrate the capability of airborne imaging spectroscopy to map sericea in a large natural grassland within the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, the largest protected tallgrass prairie in the world, located in northeastern Oklahoma. Through this research, we investigated which remotely observable vegetation functional traits (referring to biochemical, physiological, and structural traits) contribute to distinguishing sericea from cooccurring native species and whether we can detect sericea remotely through quantifying these functional traits using imaging spectroscopic data (also known as hyperspectral data). To achieve these objectives, full-range airborne hyperspectral data with spatial resolution of 1 m were collected from the study area in August 2020. In addition, a total of 12 vegetation functional traits were measured through field sampling for model development. We first identified functional traits that contributed to separating sericea from other species, and then used them in a classification model to detect sericea in our study site. We found total carotenoids (sum of neoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein), chlorophyll a + b (sum of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b), total nitrogen, canopy height, potassium, and magnesium as the main functional traits contributing to the detection of sericea; an overall classification accuracy of approximately 94% was reported. However, the proposed approach overestimated sericea cover in species-rich plant communities. Overall, our findings demonstrated an essential role for airborne remote sensing in 1) direct mapping of invasive plants and 2) quantifying functional traits associated with success strategies of invasive species. Eventually, experiments like ours can aid in developing large-scale and science-driven management practices to both identify the current extent, and to control the spread of invasive species in grasslands and similar short-stature environments. This will not only improve management practices but will have major societal and economic benefits."

The Port of Seattle and Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) have identified possible declines in bull kelp extent and changes in its distribution throughout the Central Puget Sound near Seattle, Washington. Bull kelp losses threaten critical ecological services and marine habitat, as well as important cultural resources. However, these changes are not well tracked or understood due to the expensive and time-intensive nature of traditional kelp canopy monitoring methods. The Port of Seattle and Washington DNR partnered with the NASA DEVELOP team to explore the feasibility of using Earth observations between 2016 and 2021 obtained from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) as a potential tool to monitor and map bull kelp. Our team identified a variety of challenges that need to be addressed before this approach can be utilized as an effective means for identifying or mapping nearshore urban kelp beds. We found that neither Sentinel-2 nor Landsat 8 significantly differentiates between kelp and no-known kelp using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or Normalized Difference Red-Edge Blue (NDREB). While the tidal and current filtering methods discussed here may be beneficial for identifying promising single image dates for kelp classification, the filters we used reduced the number of images each year to the point that modeling or mapping yearly kelp extent or creating time series of kelp did not appear to be feasible."

The predictive capabilities of ML models have already been used to facilitate several scientific breakthroughs. However, the practical application of ML is often limited due to the gaps in technical knowledge of its users. The common issue faced by many scientific  researchers is the inability to choose the appropriate ML pipelines that are needed to treat real-world data, which is often sparse and noisy. To solve this problem, we have developed an automated Machine Learning tool (MLtool) that includes a set of ML algorithms and approaches to aid scientific researchers. The current version of MLtool is implemented as an object-oriented Python code that is easily extensible. It includes 44 different regression algorithms used to model data. MLtool helps users select the best model for their data, based on the scoring metrics used. Besides regression algorithms, MLtool also includes a suite of pre-  and  post-processing techniques such as missing value imputation, categorical variable encoding, input feature normalization, uncertainty quantification, exploratory data analysis (EDA), etc. MLtool was tested on several publicly available multi-dimensional data sets and was found capable of making accurate predictions."

The observed anomaly in the photometric light curve is best described through a binary lens model. In this model, the source did not cross caustics and no finite-source effects were observed. Therefore, the angular Einstein ring radius θ<sub>E</sub> cannot be measured from the light curve alone. However, the large event duration, t<sub>E</sub> ∼ 80 days, allows a precise measurement of the microlensing parallax π<sub>E</sub>. In addition to the constraints on the angular radius θ* and the apparent brightness I<sub>s</sub> of the source, we employ the Besançon and GalMod galactic models to estimate the physical properties of the lens. We find excellent agreement between the predictions of the two galactic models: the companion is likely a resident of the brown dwarf desert with a mass M<sub>p</sub> ∼ 30 M<sub>Jup</sub>, and the host is a main-sequence dwarf star. The lens lies along the line of sight to the Galactic bulge, at a distance of ≤4 kpc. We estimate that in about 10 yr the lens and source will be separated by ∼55 mas, and it will be possible to confirm the exact nature of the lensing system by using high-resolution imaging from ground- or space-based observatories."

Previous HST STIS coronagraphic imaging did not detect flux along the minor axis of the disk, which could suggest a face-on geometry with two clumps of dust. These ALMA observations reveal a disk with a strikingly different structure. In order to fit models to the millimeter visibilities and constrain the uncertainties on the disk parameters, we adopt a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. This is the most eccentric debris disk observed to date with a forced eccentricity of 0.21 ± 0.02, nearly twice that of the Fomalhaut debris disk, and also displays an apocenter glow. Although this eccentric model fits the outer debris disk well, significant interior residuals remain, which may suggest a possible edge-on inner disk, which remains unresolved in these observations. Combined with the observed structure difference between HST and ALMA, these results suggest a potential previous scattering event or dynamical instability in this system. We also note that the stellar flux changes considerably over the course of our observations, suggesting flaring at millimeter wavelengths. Using simultaneous TESS observations, we determine the stellar rotation period to be 9.6 ± 0.1 days."

A general literature review was performed to identify the types of electric machines that are commonly used and which types have the biggest potential for future aircraft applications due to their high specific power and efficiency. A database with historical data was built to include parameters such as weight [kg], rated power [kW], specific power [kW/kg], RPM, efficiency, year, motor cooling type, application type and motor type to allow for trend identification and accurate projections. Once the data was gathered, multiple curve fits on the historical data were generated and extrapolated to produce the projections for specific power according to conservative, nominal and aggressive projection scenarios. A different process was followed for the efficiency projections due to the scattered nature of the data. A state of the art (SoA) value for efficiency was identified through literature review and was used to create the conservative, nominal and aggressive projections for the time frames of 2030, 2040, and 2050. The efficiency and the specific power projections of EMs for 2050 are 0.989 and 50kW/kg respectively. This paper will also be examining circuit protection as it is an additional component of electric powertrains."

However, existing platforms for airline disruption management (ADM) employ monolithic system design methods that rely on the creation of specific rules and requirements through explicit optimization routines, before a system that meets the specifications is designed. Thus, current platforms for ADM are unable to readily accommodate additional system complexities resulting from the introduction of new capabilities, such as the introduction of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), operations and infrastructure, to the system. To this end, we use historical data on airline scheduling and operations recovery to develop a system of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which describe a predictive transfer function model (PTFM) for promptly estimating the recovery impact of disruption resolutions at separate phases of flight schedule execution during ADM. Furthermore, we provide a modular approach for assessing and executing the PTFM by employing a parallel ensemble method to develop generative routines that amalgamate the system of ANNs. Our modular approach ensures that current industry standards for tardiness in flight schedule execution during ADM are satisfied, while accurately estimating appropriate time-based performance metrics for the separate phases of flight schedule execution."

The active∼22 Myr M dwarf AU Mic hosts two exoplanets orbiting interior to its debris disk. Therefore, this system provides a unique opportunity to quantify the effects of stellar X-ray and UV irradiation on planetary atmospheres as a function of both age and orbital separation. In this paper, we present over 5 hr of far-UV (FUV)observations of AU Mic taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS; 1070-1360Å) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We provide an itemization of 120 emission features in the HST/COS FUV spectrum and quantify the flux contributions from formation temperatures ranging from 104 to 107K. We detect 13 flares in the FUV white-light curve with energies ranging from 1029 to 1031erg s. The majority of the energy in each of these flares is released from the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona. There is a 100×increase influx at continuum wavelengths λ<1100 Å in each flare, which may be caused by thermal Bremsstrahlung emission. We calculate that the baseline atmospheric mass-loss rate for AU Mic b is∼108 g s−1, although this rate can be as high as∼1014 g s−1during flares with Lflare 10-33 erg s−1. Finally, we model the transmission spectra for AU Mic b and c with a new panchromatic spectrum of AU Mic and motivate future JWST observations of these planets."

This would be especially challenging for optical instruments with mirrors separated by hundreds of meters flying in Earth’s orbit. However, in this work, we show that this alignment can be achieved by means of: (i) flying the mirror cluster in a particular orbital configuration; (ii) closing a coarse positioning loop using GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System); and (iii) closing a fine wavefront-control loop using light from a laser guide star. The orbital configuration is designed to keep the mirrors passively pointing at the target star (up to a small orbital perturbation) while the interferometer cluster is orbiting and changing its baseline. The laser guide star would be flying in the same orbit but in the opposite direction. In medium- or high-Earth
orbit, the interferometer would be able to observe a star for several hours per orbit. In this work, we analyzed the performance of an optical space interferometer consisting of nine 20 cm mirrors mounted on CubeSats and flying 3 km apart (together with a combiner and a laser guide star small satellite). This configuration supports a resolution of 0.04 milliarcseconds - an order of magnitude better than current ground-based interferometers. We estimate the performance of this system imaging stellar surfaces assuming perfect wavefront estimation and
control."

This method relies on accurate polarimeter retrievals of the fine-mode column-averaged aerosol particle extinction cross section and accurate lidar measurements of vertically resolved aerosol particle extinction coefficient such as those provided by multiwavelength high spectral resolution lidar. We compare the resulting lidar + polarimeter vertically resolved N(a) product to in situ N(a) data collected by airborne instruments during the NASA aerosol cloud meteorology interactions over the western Atlantic experiment (ACTIVATE). Based on all 35 joint ACTIVATE flights in 2020, we find a total of 32 collocated in situ and remote sensing profiles that occur on 11separate days, which contain a total of 322 cloud-free vertically resolved altitude bins of 150 m resolution. We demonstrate that the lidar + polarimeter N(a) agrees to within 106% for 90% of the 322 vertically resolved points. We also demonstrate similar agreement to within 121% for the polarimeter-derived column-averaged N(a). We find that the range-normalized mean absolute deviation (NMAD) for the polarimeter-derived column-averaged Na is 21%, and the NMAD for the lidar + polarimeter-derived vertically resolved Na is 16%. Taken together, these findings suggest that the error in the polarimeter-only column-averaged N(a) and the lidar + polarimeter vertically resolved N(a) are of similar magnitude and represent a significant improvement upon current remote sensing estimates of N(a)."

Over the course of the nearly 2-year mission, at least 45 episodes of whistler mode QP emissions were detected by the Broad Band Receiver (BBR) onboard DSX. Episodes of QP emissions were identified by discrete events having a clear unambiguous periodic nature as detected by both the electric antennae and search coil magnetic sensor in the BBR survey data at 30 second temporal resolution. Most of the QP episodes occurred in a frequency range between 1- 4 kHz, in a band previously identified by Van Allen Probes and Cluster investigators. However, episodes were also detected by DSX at higher frequencies - events in these episodes extending all the way to 15 kHz. We present our findings on these unusual high frequency events in the presentation herein. Specifically, these high frequency QP episodes tended to be observed near dawn/dusk when the spacecraft was at relatively high magnetic latitudes and on magnetic L-shells between 3-5. Another unusual feature of these episodes is that individual up-drifting events making up the episode were found to sometimes occur concurrently in time: The high frequency portion of one up-drifting ‘polliwog-shaped’ event overlapped in time with the low frequency portion of the subsequent event. This behavior of the QP emissions has not been previously emphasized and we consider how this temporal concurrence relates to the source processes."

However, the inability to rapidly separate satellite fire detections by fire type hampered fire suppression and assessment of ecosystem and air quality impacts. Here, we describe the development of a near–real-time approach for tracking contributions from deforestation, forest, agricultural, and savanna fires to burned area and emissions and apply the approach to the 2019 fire season in South America. Across the southern Amazon, 19,700 deforestation fire events accounted for 39% of all satellite active fire detections and the majority of fire carbon emissions (63%; 69 Tg C). Multiday fires accounted for 81% of burned area and 92% of carbon emissions from the Amazon, with many forest fires burning uncontrolled for weeks. Most fire detections from deforestation fires were correctly identified within 2 days (67%), highlighting the potential to improve situational awareness and management outcomes during fire emergencies."

The yttrium-to-magnesium ratio, [Y/Mg], has emerged as a candidate age indicator for solar twins in the local stellar neighborhood. However, it is unclear whether it is a viable age diagnostic for more diverse stellar types, so we investigate [Y/Mg] as an age indicator for the FGK-type planet host stars observed by Kepler. We find that the [Y/Mg] ""Clock"" is most precise for solar twins, with a [Y/Mg]/age slope of m = −0.0370 ±0.0071 dex Gyr<sup>−1</sup> and σ<sub>Age</sub> = 2.6 Gyr. We attribute the lower precision compared to literature results to nonsolar twins contaminating our solar twin sample and recommend a 1.5 Gyr systematic uncertainty for stellar ages derived with any [Y/Mg]–Age relation. We also analyzed the [Y/Mg] Clock as a function of T<sub>eff</sub>, log⁡ g, and metallicity individually and find no strong trends, but we compute statistically significant [Y/Mg]–Age relations for subsamples defined by ranges in T<sub>eff</sub>, log g, and metallicity. Finally, we compare [Y/Mg] and rotation ages and find statistically similar trends as for isochrone ages, although we find that rotation ages perform better for GK dwarfs while isochrones perform better for FG subgiants. We conclude that the [Y/Mg] Clock is most precise for solar twins and analogs but is also a useful age diagnostic for FGK stars."

The Extreme Coronagraph for Living Planetary Systems (ECLIPS) is the coronagraph instrument on the LUVOIR Surveyor mission concept, an 8- to 15-m segmented telescope. ECLIPS is split into three channels, namely, UV (200 to 400 nm), optical (400 to 850 nm), and near IR (850 nm to 2 μm), with each channel equipped with two deformable mirrors for wavefront control, a suite of coronagraph masks, a low-order/out-of-band wavefront sensor, and separate science imagers and spectrographs. The apodized pupil Lyot coronagraph and the vector vortex coronagraph are the baselined mask technologies for ECLIPS to enable the required 10−10 contrast for observations in the habitable zones of nearby stars for LUVOIR-A (15-m telescope) and LUVOIR-B (8-m telescope), respectively. Their performance depends on active wavefront sensing and control, as well as metrology subsystems to compensate for aberrations induced by segment errors (e.g., piston and tip/tilt), secondary mirror misalignment, and global low-order wavefront errors. Here, we present the latest results of the simulation of these effects for
the LUVOIR coronagraph instrument and discuss the achieved contrast for exoplanet detection

At such high contrast, starlight reflected by exozodiacal dust is expected to be a significant source of contamination. Here, we present high-fidelity simulations of coronagraphic observations of a synthetic solar system located at a distance of 10 pc and observed with a 12 m and an 8 m circumscribed aperture diameter space telescope operating at 500 nm wavelength. We explore different techniques to subtract the exozodi and stellar speckles from the simulated images in the face-on, the 30 deg inclined, and the 60 deg inclined case and quantify the remaining systematic noise as a function of the exozodiacal dust level of the system. We find that in the face-on case, the exozodi can be subtracted down to the photon noise limit for exozodi levels up to ∼1000 zodi using a simple toy model for the exozodiacal disk, whereas in the 60 deg inclined case this only works up to ∼50 zodi. We also investigate the impact of larger wave front errors and larger system distance, finding that while the former has no significant impact, the latter has a strong (negative) impact. Ultimately, we derive a penalty factor as a function of the exozodi level and system inclination that should be considered in exoplanet yield studies as a realistic estimate for the excess systematic noise from the exozodi."

Communications with terrestrial ground stations is one of the critical functionalities of any space mission. Satellite scheduling is a problem that has been scientifically investigated since the 1970s. A central aspect of this problem is the need to consider resource contention and satellite visibility constraints as they require line of sight. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, prior solutions such as linear programs and evolutionary algorithms require extensive compute capabilities to output a feasible schedule for each scenario. Machine learning based scheduling can provide an alternative solution by training a model with historical data and generating a schedule quickly with model inference. We present SatNet, a benchmark for satellite scheduling optimization based on historical data from the NASA Deep Space Network. We propose formulation of the satellite scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process and use reinforcement learning (RL) policies to generate schedules. The nature of constraints imposed by SatNet differ from other combinatorial optimization problems such as vehicle routing studied in prior literature. Our initial results indicate that RL is an alternative optimization approach that can generate candidate solutions of comparable quality to existing state-of-the-practice results. However, we also find that RL policies overfit to the training dataset and do not generalize well to new data, thereby necessitating continued research on reusable and generalizable agents."

(2) A mediated hybrid recognition system in which a system is created by combining independent modules that detect each semantic feature. While some researchers believe that deep learning can solve any problem, others believe that a more engineered and symbolic approach is needed to cope with complex environments with less data. Deep learning alone has achieved state-of-the-art results in many areas, from complex gameplay to predicting protein structures. In particular, in image classification and recognition, deep learning models have achieved accuracies as high as humans. But sometimes it can be very difficult to debug if the deep learning model doesn't work. Deep learning models can be vulnerable and are very sensitive to changes in data distribution. Generalization can be problematic. It's usually hard to prove why it works or doesn't. Deep learning models can also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Here, we combine deep learning-based object recognition and tracking with an adaptive neurosymbolic network agent, called the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), that can adapt to its environment by building concepts based on perceptual sequences. We achieved an improved intersection-over-union (IOU) object recognition performance of 0.65 in the adaptive retraining model compared to IOU 0.31 in the COCO data pre-trained model. We improved the object detection limits using RADAR sensors in a simulated environment, and demonstrated the weaving car detection capability by combining deep learning-based object detection and tracking with a neurosymbolic model."

The “Gravity Poppers” mission concept (see Fig. 1) consists of a swarm of small, minimalistic probes that are deployed from a mother spacecraft to the surface of a small body and which periodically and randomly hop around the surface. By tracking the ballistic sub-orbital trajectories of this hopping swarm, a very high resolution gravity field can be measured, which can then be used to answer a number of scientific questions of interest regarding the interior mass distribution of the body. This paper describes the three core focus areas of our study to demonstrate concept feasibility: (1) the design of hopping probes to be small, simple, robust, and “visible” to a distant spacecraft, (2) the tracking strategy for detecting and estimating the trajectories of a large number of ballistic probes, and (3) the algorithmic framework by which such measurements can be used to estimate the body’s gravity field. Our results suggest the ability to estimate the gravity field of a 500m asteroid beyond degree-and-order 40 through days to weeks of optical tracking of several LED-strobing probes, with a mass of only 200 g each. Collectively, this study demonstrates that the high-resolution gravity mapping of small body interiors is technically possible, economically feasible, and would enable a compelling set of science objectives aligned with NASA’s goals in planetary science, planetary defense, and future interests in resource prospecting."

The Mars 2020 Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) System largely leveraged heritage from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) EDL System while employing targeted technological advancements. The landing process is autonomously directed by a software behavior implemented in the rover's primary flight computer called the EDL Timeline that assumes control of the vehicle six days before atmospheric entry. This paper first walks through the basics of the EDL Timeline mechanics and how the behavior is designed to account for internal system variations and environmental unknowns. It then summarizes the interactions between the EDL timeline and other high-level system behaviors like spacecraft mode transitions and system fault protection, focusing on the complications that arise when passing spacecraft control between executive functions. Although the MSL-inherited EDL System is reliable and capable, targeted updates and a thorough verification and validation program were required for Mars 2020. This paper discusses changes made to close vulnerabilities discovered during both MSL and Mars 2020 development cycles, landing system capability enhancements that were enabling for Mars 2020's mission, and how these updates were integrated with the heritage system. It then describes how both analysis and testing campaigns were utilized to verify and validate all aspects of EDL and system behaviors that run during the six days before landing, as well as the operational workarounds that were needed to address problems found during the development and commissioning process.

The Google Cloud Platform product Google Dialogflow provides lifelike conversational artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) to generate natural conversations between computers and humans. This ML utilizes natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize a user’s intent and extracts key information into a form of entities. We have developed a user-friendly application through understanding the hazardous material database, first aid safety guidelines and observing the process of first responders who access this information in the field. We created the Trusted and Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Saving Lives (TruePAL) virtual assistant using Dialogflow1 and TensorFlow2 paired with EasyOCR.3 The chatbot supports first responders by providing voice interaction which helps limit additional steps such as browsing through multiple categories when searching for information. Using feedback from our field interviews, the voice interface has been developed to enable the first responder to focus on the immediate emergency. With less distractions, the first responder is able to engage the incident more effectively. The partial hands-free TruePAL chatbot assistant improves the accessibility to the correct guidance by an average of 1.9 seconds compared to the widely used application, NIH WISER, which requires full attention to operate. We combined this intelligent chatbot with a separate visual processing capability to produce hazardous signage analysis and generate the proper guidance for first responders. With the evolving functionality of AI tools, the use of virtual assistants in first responder technology will be an advancement, benefiting the safety of both first responders and civilians."

By imaging and determining the location of decametric-hectometric (DH, 0.1 MHz–23 MHz) solar radio bursts, SunRISE will provide key information on particle acceleration mechanisms associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the magnetic field topology from active regions into interplanetary space. The SunRISE Observatory will consist of six space vehicles in a passive formation, in orbits designed to keep them within approximately 10 km of each other, and flying in a supersynchronous geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). Each space vehicle consists of a Solar DH-GNSS payload and a 6U form factor spacecraft. The SunRISE Observatory together with significant ground-based processing, will enable imaging of the Sun in a portion of the spectrum that is blocked by the ionosphere and cannot be observed from Earth. Key aspects that enable this mission are that only position knowledge of the space vehicles is required, not active control, and that the architecture involves a modest amount of on-board processing coupled with significant ground-based processing for navigation, position determination, and science operations. Mission-enabling advances in software-defined radios, GPS navigation and timing, and small spacecraft technologies, developed and flown on the DARPA High Frequency Research (DHFR) and the Community Initiative for Continuing Earth Radio Occultation (CICERO) have made this mission affordable and low-risk. The SunRISE mission will exploit the multiple spacecraft per aperture (MSPA) capability of NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN), for more efficient data transfers of larger data volumes, and utilize commercial access to space, in which the SunRISE space vehicles will be carried to their target orbit as secondary payloads in conjunction with a larger host spacecraft intended for GEO."

This paper presents a number of practical improvements to pave the way for potential future onboard deployment. First, we achieved 97.0% overall pixel accuracy, evaluated against the classification generated by human experts on images from Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) missions. The substantial increase in accuracy was primarily enabled by the sheer volume of data used for training; we created a new large-scale dataset of Martian terrain labels, namely AI4Mars, which contains more than 400k labels contributed by citizen scientists for 50k images taken by the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) and Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. Second, we demonstrated that SPOC can quickly adapt to a new mission landed on a previously unseen site. Specifically, we pretrained a model with MER and MSL data from the AI4Mars dataset and then adapted to the Mars 2020 Rover (M2020) by feeding a small volume of data between Sol 0 and 157; the adapted model was tested on Sol 200-203 and resulted in 84.2% overall pixel accuracy and 93.4% reliability (recall) for detecting sand, the most concerning class for rover’s traversability. Third, we found that pretraining can substantially mitigate the decline of accuracy over time. We showed that the performance of a SPOC model pretrained with the ImageNet dataset and then trained by MSL images only up to Sol 390 remains comparable to a model trained by images up to Sol 1689 on the test data after Sol 1689. Fourth, we reimplemented SPOC with a light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN), MobileNetV2, which typically runs within tens of milliseconds (ms) on mobile processors such as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon. Finally, we released the AI4Mars dataset to the public to encourage open innovation."

Two cubesats carrying thermal infrared spectrometers (TIRS) in polar orbits will test long-held assumptions regarding radiative balance at long wavelengths where the cold-dry Arctic and Antarctic surfaces expel significant amounts of the earth's radiant energy. Thermal radiometry with better than one micron sampling at wavelengths beyond 15 microns will provide critical observational bounds for inputs into glacier melt and climate change models through improvements in surface emissivities, longwave greenhouse effect parameterizations, and cloud presence/types. Additional information on potential far-infrared surface/atmosphere feedbacks during rapid melt processes may be captured with sub-diurnal revisits of targeted areas. A baseline mission with two cubesats in different orbits provides a means for optimization of sub-diurnal sampling for science purposes. In this presentation we provide details of orbit studies that inform expected sampling metrics. Candidate orbits are modeled in SGP and then TIRS sampling is projected into surface footprints with appropriate geo-location. Matching algorithms then compile statistics for time-delayed revisits between and within the two orbits. Binning of results by latitude allows for abstraction of precession issues as well as for correlations with surface types as defined by radiometric classification schemes. Multiple acceptable pairs of science-driven orbits were found that optimize sampling in areas known to experience rapid melt events. The final choice of PREFIRE orbital parameters includes the systems trade-space, particularly the power budget, as well as the availability of launch opportunities."

Now past its project critical design review, Europa Clipper is starting the execution of its verification and validation (V&V) program. The payload V&V function in particular is responsible for designing and coordinating a thorough test and analysis program that will confirm the proper functioning and performance of our payload instruments. Given the large number of instruments to manage, we have developed a suite of standardized tests and analyses that are designed to cover all of the common interfaces across instruments, while allowing for flexibility to support the unique needs of individual instruments. This suite of activities, coordinated and/or performed by the payload team, forms the bulk of our payload verification and validation campaign. This paper provides a detailed summary of the full set of V&V activities in that suite, covering the four categories of activities: analysis of lower-level evidence, analysis via simulation, testing in the system testbeds, and testing in assembly, test, and launch operations (ATLO). We will describe the purpose of each activity type, how the activities are developed, and the review process for each type of activity. We then define the complete list of activities written for each instrument and how subtleties specific to certain instruments are managed. The discussion will provide a comprehensive understanding of the activities in the payload V&V purview and how various interfaces with different levels of the project are managed. This paper also describes key metrics the payload team uses to track V&V progress and some insights into the teaming design and division of labor we use to ensure consistency and completeness across the entire payload suite. Finally, the paper will offer a snapshot of the status of the Payload V&V program prior to instrument delivery and offer insights into the upcoming phase of instrument delivery and the start of ATLO."

The Psyche mission will utilize electric propulsion with SPT-140 Hall thrusters to rendezvous and orbit the metal-rich asteroid (16) Psyche, in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Psyche spacecraft requires no chemical propulsion and, when launched in 2022, will be the first mission to use Hall thrusters beyond lunar orbit. The Psyche spacecraft is a hybrid development with Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)-provided deep-space avionics and communications equipment mounted on a high-heritage MAXAR (formerly Space Systems Loral) Solar-Electric Propulsion (SEP) Chassis, based on their 1300 series of GEO communications satellites. The spacecraft is equipped to support a suite of science instruments, as well as a demonstration of the Deep Space Optical Communications (DSOC) technology. The spacecraft has sufficient onboard resources, autonomy, redundancy, and operability to complete a 3.5-year cruise to 16 Psyche, followed by a 20-month campaign of science investigations while orbiting the asteroid.The mission’s early concept design and progress through Preliminary Design Review (PDR) has been described in previous work. The paper will cover the recent mission progress from the Critical Design Review (CDR) through the start of Spacecraft Environmental Testing, which took place during the COVID pandemic.The authors will highlight the successful remote collaboration between the major partners: ASU, JPL, MAXAR, and the Payload teams that led to the initiation of the Assembly, Test, Launch, Operations Phase (ATLO) in early March 2021. Emphasis will be placed on the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the work environment over the last 16+ months, including challenges to delivery of flight hardware and test equipment. In addition to the COVID-19 challenges, other significant anomalies discovered during design and test will be described along with any impacts to the overall science capability of the mission."

These Rules of Thumb typically take the form ofa sequence of percentages over which a total cost is allocatedacross NASA WBS elements. Rules of Thumb can then be usedto extrapolate cost from one or more known WBS elements tothe remaining unknown WBS elements, assisting early projectformulation architecture studies (such as those in JPL’s Team Xand A Team).A number of issues can arise when generating and using costRules of Thumb. For example, many records of project costsconsist of incomplete data. Typical methods of dealing withincomplete cost allocation data include (a) ignoring missionswith incomplete data, or (b) taking averages of the non-zero percentagesacross missions, but both of these methods can result inbiased estimates if the existence of incomplete data correlateswith total mission cost or any particular WBS element. Anothercommon example is cost reported in one or more incorrect WBSelements. This is especially prevalent in smaller missions whereit is more common for engineers to perform tasks that fall underthe purview of multiple WBS elements.Furthermore, a Rule of Thumb estimate is typically reported asa point estimate; there is no reported uncertainty around thepercentages used to generate an allocation. Even in the rarecase in which confidence intervals around mean percentages areprovided, there may be positive or negative correlations betweenWBS elements which can skew estimates.Here we attempt to address these problems by formulatingprobabilistic Rules of Thumb in which a distribution of allocationschemes, rather than a single allocation scheme, is generated.We use a bootstrap imputation method to simultaneouslyaccount for uncertainty in the missing data while using allavailable information contained in the dataset. The imputeddatasets are then input into a multivariate Bayesian modelwhich accounts for correlations between WBS elements andproperly accounts for uncertainty in the final Rule of Thumbpercentages and predictions. We describe the mathematicalmodel and provides snippets of R code utilizing the brms(Bayesian Regression Models using Stan) package. To illustratethis model, we generate a Bayesian Level 2 WBS Cost Rule ofThumb for MIDEX (Medium-Class Explorers) missions withdata extracted from NASA’s CADRe. We then compare thismethod’s performance with the classical Rule of Thumb method."

Landing successfully on 18 Feb 2021, the rover’s transmitted data during its entry, descent, and landing (EDL) were captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) orbiter. This data, broadcast in near-realtime to the world, allowed everyone to share in the excitement (and “terror”) of the day. The images returned thereafter included the first images of the new landing site, video of the landing itself taken from a variety of vantage points, and eventually the historic images of the first powered flight on another planet. Behind the scenes, the return of that data to Earth was accomplished via Mars orbiters operated by NASA and ESA, using three different ground tracking networks. Considered together, this Mars Relay Network (MRN) enabled the successful, timely, and unobtrusive return of the rover’s data. This paper describes the preparations taken by the participants of the MRN in anticipation of the arrival of Perseverance at Mars. These were not only focused on successfully acquiring the rover’s critical event telemetry during its EDL, but also on readying the network to return the rover’s data on an ongoing basis as it pursued its mission objectives. Included is a brief description of the MRN, which represents a highly successful international collaboration and continues as critical infrastructure for NASA’s and ESA’s ongoing Mars exploration. Also summarized are the activities performed prior to EDL, including landing site reconnaissance and mission test and training activities; those activities performed on EDL day, especially the recording, return, and processing of the rover’s critical event telemetry; and those activities that are now being performed on an ongoing basis during the rover’s surface operations, including an outline of the planning processes that enable relay services. Finally, a description of the performance of the network to-date on behalf of the Perseverance rover is given, summarizing the success of the network to provide support to both it and other spacecraft on the surface of Mars."

The Perseverance team defines these parameters as software variables that are configurable, commandable and retrievable from Earth. In 2015, the Mars 2020 project leaders focused on improving systems engineering of parameters based on their experiences from parameter management on previous Mars rovers (Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit, and Pathfinder) and parameter failures of past missions, such as the mission-ending parameter of the Mars Climate Orbiter. The new rigorous development process allowed for efficient certification and effective implementation of the parameters, allowing the rover to approach and land on the red planet (the most challenging phase of the mission) with zero parameter issues. Although successful, the Perseverance team learned many lessons for how to better manage parameters for the continued surface operations of the Mars 2020 mission and future missions. This paper will discuss eight parameter-management topics for the Perseverance Mission. The first is parameter definition: how we define parameters on our mission, where they are physically located on the vehicle, and why we have so many of them. The second topic is the updated parameter flight software module from Curiosity, including details on the 99% reduction in parameter commands, new bulk configuration capabilities, and improved parameter traceability. The third topic is parameter selection for different mission phases; this includes improving and tweaking our preferred parameter settings until they become certification candidates and managing parameter configurations based on test venue throughout the mission life cycle. The fourth topic is our flight certification process; this includes certification of flight values for four different epochs in the mission: Launch, Entry Decent and Landing (EDL) - 6days, Landing + 5 Sols (Martian Days, still on Cruise Flight Software), and once are on Surface Flight Software (FSW). The fifth topic covers in-flight command implementation, along with details on testing, validation, and verification of those commands. In the sixth section, we will explain our use of open-source management tools, including how we used GitHub for version control and management approvals. The seventh topic will describe the ground tools used in operations, including capabilities of the in-house built tool called Parasol. The eighth and final topic will dig into lessons learned for improving parameter management in the future of this mission and others."

The selection of the VERITAS, EnVision, and DAVINCI missions by NASA and ESA in June 2021 is an important step in advancing the science. However, addressing many of the most challenging questions will require in situ platforms that can operate in the Venus environment for extended periods in order to capture the full complexity of our sister planet.  Aerobots are aerial vehicles that exploit buoyancy to achieve long-duration operation in the Venus cloud layer where environmental conditions are comparatively benign. Buoyancy control, explained in more detail in a companion paper at this conference, allows aerobots to change altitude with little energy expenditure enabling new scientific measurement opportunities. These include atmospheric chemistry, dynamics, geophysical measurements of the crust and interior and geological investigations enabled by high resolution surface imaging.  One aspect to our approach to defining missions that fit within the resource constraints of competitive missions is keeping the scale small. Today’s science-driven appetite for sophisticated measurements and large volumes of data is driving size upwards but advances in technology can enable aerobots that can be delivered to Venus at manageable costs. The other aspect is supporting the aerobot at Venus with orbiters providing data relay, localization and synergistic science. The recently selected orbiters, equipped with low-cost proximity relay systems routinely used at Mars may obviate the need for dedicated orbiters thereby enabling Discovery mission candidates.  Four aerobot mission concepts have been defined which fit comfortably within the current New Frontiers (NF) cost cap ($900M in $FY22). One of these concepts would also be a candidate for a Discovery mission if that cost cap ($500M in $FY19) were raised. Raising the NF cost cap would enable more capable aerobot missions combining both altitude control with synergistic orbital observations. Investigations of surface geology at high resolution with subcloud NIR nightside imaging and dropsondes on the dayside of Venus could also benefit from collaborations with foreign contributions."

The mission’s goal is to understand the form, abundance, and distribution of water on the Moon and the lunar water cycle. Lunar Trailblazer also collects data of candidate landing sites to inform planning for future human and robotic exploration of the Moon and evaluate the potential for in situ resource utilization. Lunar Trailblazer’s two science instruments, the High-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper (HVM3) and the Lunar Thermal Mapper (LTM) provide simultaneous high-resolution spectral imaging data to map OH/water, crustal composition, and thermophysical properties from a 100±30 km lunar polar orbit. The ~210-kg flight system deploys from an ESPA Grande and utilizes a ~1000 m/s ΔV hydrazine chemical propulsion system, similar to that employed by GRAIL. Trailblazing elements include the novel state-of-the-art dataset collected at substantially reduced price point, fully geographically co-registered data products delivered to the Planetary Data System, planetary mission team demographics, Caltech campus mission operations, and student staffing of select mission ops roles.

The M2020 Surface Mission Operations Team trained for landing the Perseverance Rover under COVID-19 remote work/mandatory stay-at-home conditions. Training activities included presenting Flight Schools to the team via video conferencing, training COVID personal safety requirements to on-premises staff, and constantly updating and communicating COVID restrictions to the team as safety requirements changed. This paper explores the impact of COVID on the Mission System Training for M2020 Mission Operations.  The layers of COVID, aptly named the “COVID Tax” by team management, affected project roles, communications, personnel interactions, operations facility usage and training exercises practiced by the team. Flight Schools and Operational Readiness Tests (ORTs) are driving forces behind the surface mission operations training. These activities work hand-in-hand to prepare the team for landing day, surface operations that transition from cruise to nominal operations, and nominal operations.  Under normal training conditions, Flight Schools and ORTs are only concerned with tactical operations for the Uplink (Command) Downlink (Analysis) and Campaign Implementation (Planning) Teams of scientists and system engineers. Due to COVID, and the necessity to maintain physical distance between people, training for the landing team needed to include the new category of COVID personal safety. COVID also necessitated remote teams and video conferencing of the entirety of Flight Schools. This reliance on distance learning had not been done on previous missions. We will explore the advantages and disadvantages of video conferencing as a training platform; training effectiveness in communicating and practicing the multiple changes to the COVID safety protocols; and the timing in which we received and responded to COVID directives. Additionally, this paper will review the practical measures taken by the on-premises team and how the team adapted during the readiness tests, landing, and early mission operations, as well as how the team responded to the post-vaccine ramping down of COVID Protocols. The M2020 Surface Mission Operations Team responded very well to the challenges of COVID. All pre-landing operational and COVID-related training was completed. Post-landing COVID Training was provided as needed to new on-premises personnel. Training presented on COVID for the first operational readiness test (ORT) consisted of 2.5 hours of training.  Each ORT had COVID Training. A person who had participated in all of the ORTs from September 2020 – February 2021 would have received over 7 hours of COVID Training. By ORT-12 (approximately 8 weeks after the first ORT), the Training team consolidated the original COVID training to a one-hour COVID Basic Training course, with additional recommended training. The Basic training course was updated after landing, as vaccines became available. COVID Training had multiple Flight Schools in the self-directed Blackboard Learning system, as well as a Quick Reference Wiki for Onboarding of new on-premises personnel and keeping on-premises personnel up-to-date. COVID Training covered many topics including practical methods of 6-foot distancing, how to interact with an IT professional when help was needed at a workstation, and challenging indoor meal-eating protocols. COVID Training continued to be updated, as the lab and the project respond to the virus variants and federal, state and local ordinances."

The SAPP Downlink Engineering Operations team members receive data from the rover on a daily basis. They must interpret the data to make sure the rover is staying safe and to support uplink planning. The SAPP team keeps track of the error growth in the rover’s attitude estimate due to noise in the Rover Inertial Measurement Unit’s (RIMU) gyroscopes used to propagate that attitude estimate whenever the rover is moving. Whenever this error grows to a particular threshold, SAPP is responsible for updating the onboard attitude knowledge using the RIMU’s accelerometers to estimate rover roll and pitch and sun imaging to estimate rover yaw, thereby reducing this attitude estimation error. Accurate attitude estimation is required so that the rover can successfully point its High Gain Antenna (HGA) to receive information from Earth and as a backup to the Mars orbiters used for sending data from the rover to Earth, point instruments on its Remote Sensing Mast (RSM), and support safe movement and placement of instruments by the rover’s ARM relative to the Martian surface. The Mars 2020 Engineering Operations team has been working to increase the operational efficiency of the mission and eventually move to a five-hour timeline for daily operations. In pursuit of this goal, the SAPP Engineering Operations team has automated their downlink process by developing a centralized Jupyter notebook to analyze the data received daily from the rover. The SAPP downlink Jupyter notebook automatically collects the data relevant to the SAPP subsystem and visualizes this information in plots and tables that can be easily read by downlink operators to aid them in assessing the status of the subsystem. Various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been incorporated into the downlink daily notebook to automate the collection and posting of data, such as gathering and posting data products to the cloud. The SAPP team has also developed a SAPP downlink software library that includes functions to aid the notebook in processing data. In addition to assessing the SAPP subsystem on a daily basis, operators need to assess the long-term trending behavior of the subsystem over time. An automated trending process has been developed to collect information from the daily notebooks in order to plot and analyze that data in a centralized place. These daily and trending processes have expedited the SAPP downlink assessment and laid the groundwork to completely automate the SAPP downlink process so that SAPP operators are unnecessary unless something unexpected occurs. This paper will provide an overview of the functions that the SAPP subsystem carries out on a daily basis, and will then dive into the automations that have been developed for daily and trending downlink assessment. An assessment of the downlink efficiency will be provided, along with a summary of lessons learned and work to go. Finally, the authors will discuss how these types of automated spacecraft health assessments could be more broadly used within mission operations."

Perseverance’s main mission objective is to cache Martian rock and regolith samples in hermetically sealed tubes to be brought back to Earth by future missions. To achieve this goal the rover is equipped with a 2-meter-long Robotic Arm (RA) which manipulates the Turret to interact with the surface. The Turret is comprised of science instruments and tools that enable surface sampling and science. The backbone of the Turret hardware is the Rotary Percussive Coring Drill. The science instruments, which are directly mounted to the structural housing of this drill, must be able to withstand not only the launch and entry, descent and landing (EDL) loads of the vehicle but also the dynamic percussive environment, induced by the drill throughout surface operations. This paper discusses the technical hardware design, development and testing of a vibration isolation system to protect the Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC) Instrument from these dynamic environments.  The hardware design aspect of this problem was limited by both size and mass constraints. The Turret is tightly configured and the physical space in which hardware can reside is restricted due to multiple axes of surface interaction points. Another driving requirement is the extreme range of thermal non-operational environment from -135C to +90C. This, in addition to SHERLOC being a heavier instrument than previously integrated on a turret, made the use of isolation systems employed on previous rover missions problematic. The final design incorporates custom wire mesh springs preloaded within titanium hexapod struts equipped with flexure ends. Custom versions of commercially available wire mesh springs were designed and tested. These custom springs differed in dimension, density and stiffness from the off the shelf options. The newly designed springs went through various stages of flight acceptance testing. Detailed physics-based modeling to understand what loads the isolation system would experience was used to define the test conditions for the springs and entire isolation subsystem. The testing program developed around this was extensive to fully characterize the isolation performance over cleanliness levels, temperature and life. Another major aspect of this work was developing a method of replicating the drill’s percussive environment for performance and life testing of Turret mounted hardware. Attaching the instrument to an operating drill for testing was not a viable option. A method of using a Highly Accelerated Life Test (HALT) table was developed and applied across the project as the most representative and tunable option to physically simulate this new environment. This method, along with launch environment random vibration testing, was used to build an entire dynamic qualification and flight hardware test program. The results of the design, modeling, testing and analysis of the SHERLOC Isolation System is described throughout the following paper."

This problem is more pronounced in large and complex deployable elements where characterization of transient dynamics using testing and simulation can be challenging. This paper introduces a multi-agent control theory approach to address the problem of collisions and transient behavior in deployable lattice systems. We introduce the graph theoretic and relative error vector-based state-space structures to represent the geometry of a lattice-based deploy system. We show that under the assumption of almost-strict dissipativity, the closed-loop feedback gains of the relative error dynamics are the spring and damper constants in the structure. Moreover, we introduce the control perspective of shaping transient dynamics using eigenstructure assignment and balanced coordinate transformation."

In late2019, the team released the first tool prototype which uses a nonparametricregression technique, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),on actual data from historical CubeSat missions to produceearly ballpark analogy-based cost estimates for new CubeSatconcepts. Since the KNN prototype was first released, theCOMPACT team has normalized 17 new missions to be addedto the model in COMPACT V2. COMPACT V2 also featureschanges to the KNN tool algorithm including the introduction ofPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) to the model developmentprocess and changes to the input parameters which have madethe analogy results more intuitive and have improved modelperformance. This paper describes the current COMPACTKNN dataset, improvements made to the model in COMPACTV2, an assessment of current model performance, and a forwardlook at COMPACT’s planned future enhancements."

The CubeSats are scheduled for launch in March and October of 2023. The purpose of the TIRS instrument is to make spectrally resolved measurements of the Earth’s thermal radiation from the top of the atmosphere. PREFIRE will document, for the first time, variability in spectral fluxes from 4 to 54 microns on hourly to seasonal timescales. The primary mission is 12 months in a polar orbit with inclination of 82  to 98  at altitudes between 450 km and 650 km. The TIRS instrument is an Offner spectrometer that uses a thermopile detector array and a Schwarzchild telescope. In addition, there is a scan mirror which is periodically actuated for calibration. The instrument concept of operation is to collect radiation emitted towards zenith in a nadir sounding orientation with periodic internal and space calibrations. The TIRS thermal control architecture consists of entirely passive elements. The instrument requires all elements be maintained between 0 C and 50 C during operation for the duration of the mission. An overview of the overall thermal control design approach is presented."

The entry, descent, and landing (EDL) sequence of the spacecraft largely leveraged the previous 2012 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. The atmospheric modeling approach for Mars 2020 was also borrowed from MSL. It consisted of two mesoscale atmospheric models of the target site during the Martian season of landing, and a statistical model of the pressure, density, temperature, and winds based on the mesoscale model data. This paper briefly describes the pre-flight atmospheric models used for Mars 2020, but focuses on the post-flight assessment of these models and comparison to near-landing day orbiter sounder and other onboard atmospheric measurements. Observations from post-flight analysis showed that density was under-predicted in the upper atmosphere, but within the altitudes covered by the mesoscale models, the pre-flight modeling matched post-flight results, including for quantities like wind velocities. Potential improvements to address the upper atmosphere and other deficiencies of the Mars 2020 pre-flight model are also discussed."

The benefits of using VO during driving are that it minimizes rover position uncertainty and can be used to monitor wheel slip, halting a drive if excessive wheel slip is occurring. The VO implementation on board Curiosity acquires and processes VO images in between drive steps while the rover is stationary. A VO Thinking While Driving (VTWD) flight software capability has been developed which enables the processing of VO images during rover driving, increasing the distance Curiosity can drive with VO in a given time period up to as much as 1.75x total distance.  Verification and Validation (V\&V) of the capability has been challenging due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and unavailability of the JPL Mars Yard outdoor test site. The VTWD V\&V test procedures were modified to use a small indoor space with Mars-like terrain. This paper describes the 3 year V\&V effort under challenging conditions to approve the VTWD capability for use on the Curiosity rover."

A critical component toenable precision navigation during long traverses is the abilityto perform on-board absolute localization to eliminate drift inposition estimates of the on-board odometry algorithm. Inthis paper, we present an approach for on-board map-basedlocalization to provide global reference position based on orbitalor aerial image maps. Our approach builds on a vision-basedlocalization method to localize against a map derived fromHiRISE image products – an ortho-projected image (orthoimage) and a corresponding digital elevation map. The mapis pre-computed using a feature-based approach. Features arestored with their 3D world coordinates, and a descriptor to codethe local image intensity information in the vicinity of the featurelocation. An on-board matching algorithm uses this informationto match visual features in a query image acquired during flight,guided by a pose prior from the on-board range-visual-inertialstate estimator (Range-VIO). Valid matches are then used bya perspective-n-point (PnP) algorithm to estimate the absolutepose of the vehicle in a global frame. We demonstrate andevaluate our approach on simulated data, and data from UASflights."

Accurate map products that are based on orbital reconnaissance data must be validated for navigation applications to ensure that all relevant error sources are minimized. Currently available map products have been generated for scientific applications, so the need for accurate TRN maps remains a gap to be filled for upcoming lunar lander missions, in particular missions to the South Pole region. Additionally, representative high-resolution maps that contain lander-scale features are needed for successful development and testing of Hazard Detection (HD) systems.

Currently, capturing high-fidelity realistic images in space for this scenario is difficult and exorbitantly expensive. Therefore, we developed a framework to simulate the spacecraft orbits in Basilisk software and generate high-fidelity realistic images of spacecraft in Unreal Engine, including the effects from Sun, Earth, Moon and stars. The Ego spacecraft uses cameras to capture images of the uncooperative Target and estimates its position and attitude using a CNN based 6DOF pose estimation pipeline, eliminating need for large SWAP-C(Size, Weight, Power and Cost) sensors like LIDAR or reliance on inter-spacecraft communication, This CNN, which is motivated by ESA’s Pose Estimation challenge of 2019, is trained using simulated data from our end-to-end simulation framework. We compare the performance of two distinct CNNbased algorithms for pose estimation along a nominal trajectory. In presence of non-Gaussian modeling uncertainties, the statedependent estimation error is characterized with a quadratic upper-bound. The quadratically-bounded error can be used by a robust controller to maneuver"

Diffusion in melts and magmas is due to thermally excited random motion of atoms, ions, and clusters, and plays a critical role in magmatic and volcanic processes. In melts and magmas, diffusion is one of the two mechanisms of mass transfer; the other being bulk flow (referred to as convection or advection). When both are present, diffusion refers to the dispersive motion relative to the mean bulk flow in a given reference frame (Richter et al. 1998). Diffusion plays critical roles in controlling magma mixing (Watson 1982; Koyaguchi 1985, 1989; Lesher 1994; Huber et al. 2009; Guo and Zhang 2020), mineral growth and dissolution rates in magmas (e.g., Watson 1982; Harrison and Watson 1983; Zhang et al. 1989; Newcombe et al. 2014; Macris et al. 2018), bubble growth and dissolution rate in magmas (Sparks 1978; Proussevitch and Sahagian 1998; Liu and Zhang 2000; Zhang 2013), and elemental and isotope fractionation during mineral 2 growth and dissolution (Jambon 1980; Richter et al. 1999, 2003; Watson and Muller 2009; Chopra et al. 2012; Watkins et al. 2014, 2017; Holycross et al. 2016, 2018). As a result, diffusion also plays an essential role in explosive volcanic eruptions and magma crystallization. Furthermore, diffusion has important applications in geospeedometry (Lasaga 1983, 1998; Zhang 1994, 2008; Trail et al. 2016; Zhang and Xu 2016).

Experimental investigation of diffusion in geologically relevant silicate melts began to flourish in the 1970’s when micro-analytical measurements of diffusion profiles became available. In addition to the vast number of papers published since then, numerous books and reviews are available for diffusion in silicate melts. Hofmann et al. (1974) edited a book titled “Geochemical Transport and Kinetics” published by Carnegie Institution of Washington. This was the first landmark book summarizing the field. Lasaga and Kirkpatrick (1981) edited a book “Kinetics of Geochemical Processes” as volume 8 of the Reviews in Mineralogy (later becoming Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry) series. Zhang and Cherniak (2010) edited “Diffusion in Minerals and Melts” as volume 72 of Reviews of Mineralogy and Geochemistry series, in which one chapter focused on diffusion theory, five chapters on diffusion in silicate melts (Behrens 2010; Lesher 2010; Liang 2010; Zhang and Ni 2010; Zhang et al. 2010), and other chapters were on experimental, analytical, and computational methods, and diffusion in minerals. Several textbooks covered the principles and applications of diffusion theories (Kirkaldy and Young 1987; Shewmon 1989; Cussler 1997; Lasaga 1998; Zhang 2008; Vrentas and Vrentas 2016), and two classic books covered the mathematics of diffusion (Carslaw and Jaeger 1959; Crank 1975). In preparing for this review chapter, we thought carefully about what to cover for this vast field, and decided to briefly go through the fundamentals of diffusion (more complete review can be found in Chakraborty 1995; Zhang 2008, 2010) and solutions to often-encountered 3 diffusion problems, and then focus on post-2010 diffusion studies on silicate melts and magmas. Here, melts refer to (mostly natural) silicate liquid, and magmas refer to crystal-bearing and/or bubble-bearing melts in which the continuous phase is the melt. There is a large body of work on diffusion in glasses, especially in the materials science literature, which is not covered in this review."

This observatory offers unprecedented capabilities to obtain unique information on the magnetic and plasma properties of the magnetospheres of hot stars. We describe an observing program making use of the known population of magnetic hot stars to test the fundamental hypothesis that magnetospheres should act to rapidly drain angular momentum, thereby spinning the star down, whilst simultaneously reducing the net mass-loss rate. Both effects are expected to lead to dramatic differences in the evolution of magnetic vs. non-magnetic stars."

Because martian magmas are S-rich, and some trace metals are reported to have enhanced solubility in S-bearing magmas, we have carried out a series of experiments to evaluate the effect of high-S melts on the olivine/melt partitioning of Ni, Co, Mn, V, and Cr. Near-liquidus experiments on a synthetic primary martian mantle melt (Yamato-980459 [Y98]) were completed in a piston-cylinder apparatus at 0.75 GPa. Previous studies in S-free systems illustrate that the partition coefficients for these elements are dependent chiefly on D(Mg(Ol/melt)) (the partition coefficient defined as wt% Mg in olivine/wt% Mg in melt, a proxy for temperature), and were used to calibrate a predictive expression that includes the effects of temperature [i.e., D(Mg(Ol/melt))], melt composition, and oxygen fugacity. These predictive expressions are then used to isolate any effect in DM olivine/melt due to dissolved sulfur. The results show that S might have a small effect for Co, but not enough to change Co partitioning from compatible to incompatible in our experiments. The addition of a sulfur term to the D(Co) predictive expressions shows that nearly 8000 ppm of sulfur would be required in the melt (at liquidus temperature of Y98) for D(Co) to become <1. These S contents are two times higher than those of a sulfide-saturated melt at the P-T conditions of a martian mantle source region. Therefore, the anomalous incompatible behavior observed in these primary magma suites must be due to another mechanism. High temperature, oxygen fugacity, and diffusion are not viable mechanisms, but magma mixing, assimilation, or kinetic crystallization effects remain possibilities."

Those studies often fail to adequately reflect a critical characterization of migration —phenology. This shortcoming has been partly due to the lack of reliable continental-scale data, a gap filled by our current study. Here, we leveraged unique radar-based data quantifying migration phenology and used an objective regionalization approach to revisit the traditional spatial framework. Consequently, we identified two regions with distinct inter annual variability of spring migration across the contiguous U.S. This new data-driven framework has enabled us to explore the climatic cues affecting the inter annual variability of migration phenology, “specific to each region” across North America. For example, our “two-region” approach allowed us to identify an east-west dipole pattern in migratory behavior linked to atmospheric Ross by waves. Also, we revealed a low-frequency variability in migration movements over the western U.S. that is inversely related with temperature and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Our spatial platform would facilitate future work on better understanding the mechanisms responsible for broad-scale migration phenology and its potential future changes"

However, in order to develop a long term utilization plan that includes the usage of in-situ water we must first understand the abundance, stratigraphy and distribution of this re-source. Multiple space agencies currently have plans for lunar water prospecting missions. The Optimized Volatile Extraction Node (OVEN) was designed for water prospecting missions that require samples to be weighed, sealed, and heated as the means of determining water concentration. This method of water quantification necessitates a fair amount of automation, so a rigorous environmental test program was performed in order to build confidence in the performance of the OVEN design. The work presented here describes the OVEN environmental test program as well as ongoing efforts to improve on the design. 

Vibration:  The OVEN participated in two rounds of random vibration tests. The first test was a stand-alone test performed at the Energy Systems Test Area of the Johnson Space Center. The second test was an integrated test with the mobile platform developed for the Resource Prospector project. The OVEN survived both tests without damage, but the tests did provide valuable lessons learned with regards to specific operations.  

Thermal Vacuum:  The OVEN was successfully demonstrated at a temperature range of -50 to 75 C in a thermal vacuum chamber. The need to heat motor gearboxes at lower temperatures was predetermined so this test program was completed by implementing a method of gearbox heating that used the existing circuitry within the motors. 

Dust: A custom dynamometer was built in order to determine the torque required to move the various mechanisms within the OVEN at a range of temperatures. The OVEN system was coated with lunar dust simulant in order to determine mechanism torques under a worst-case operating condition. 

Sublimation: Sublimation losses within the OVEN were quantified through a series of test configurations, including an integrated test in a thermal vacuum chamber at Glenn Research Center [2].

Current Work: The OVEN subsystem is currently not a component of any existing prospecting missions, but work continues that will take the lessons learned from previous environmental tests and improve on the design in order to be considered for future prospecting opportunities.

Ice cloud optical properties (i.e., spectral scattering and absorption) are estimated based on the effective size and habit mixture of the cloud particles. Historically, the ice cloud D(e) has been parameterized from aircraft in situ measurements. However, aircraft-based parameterizations are opportunistic in that they only represent specific types of clouds (e.g., convective anvil, tropopause-topped cirrus) in the regions in which they were sampled and, in some cases, are limited in fully resolving the entire vertical cloud layer. Breaking away from the aircraft-based parameterization paradigm, this study is the first of its kind to attempt a parameterization of D(e) as a function of temperature, ice water content (IWC), and lidar-derived extinction from satellite-based global oceanic measurements of ice clouds. Data from both active and passive remote sensing sensors from two of NASA’s A-Train satellites, CloudSat and CALIPSO, are collected to guide development of globally robust parameterizations of all ice cloud types and one exclusively for cirrus clouds."

While physical models are ideal for understanding the data, they are not always feasible, particularly when our ability to observe at finer scales exceeds our ability to incorporate the physics. Statistical models are more generalized, but computationally intensive for many Earth Observation datasets. Machine Learning models generally scale well but are sometimes limited in the physical understanding they can offer. Hybrid models combine attributes—and advantages—of two or more of these types."

Deployable structures allow for a folded or stowed configuration during launch and deployment at the mission location. Polymer composites have shown both high weight savings over current metallic structure, as well as improved specific mechanical strengths overall. One issue encountered with polymer composite deployables, however, is stress relaxation of the polymer matrix in the stowed configuration.

The primary purpose was to complete the development of the TTR, including systems integration with the NFAC. The TTR and rotor were tested up to 273 knots in axial flow, which is the highest airspeed ever achieved by a full-scale proprotor in any wind tunnel. The entry constitutes the first full-scale wind-tunnel test of a gimballed, coning-flexure rotor. Extensive conversion-mode data were also acquired, and hover/climb conditions were explored.

However, given the size of most LV systems, free-free testing is a challenge and often not feasible. With this, a test stand, typically the launch pad itself, is introduced as the means of support. This shifts the challenge to developing robust numerical methods for removing the influence of the launch pad from the integrated system modal test. The Space Launch System (SLS) is no exception where the mobile launcher (ML) is used to support the vehicle for the integrated modal test (IMT). For the IMT, it is well understood from pre-test analysis with finite element models (FEMs) of the SLS and SLS coupled to ML that the ML has a significant influence on the SLS modal properties especially in the lower frequency range where the primary SLS bending modes exist. An accelerance decoupling (AD) method has been formulated for the purpose of “subtracting out” the influence of the ML from the IMT results. With AD, the SLS decoupled frequency response functions (FRFs) are directly extracted from the IMT FRFs. The subject approach is aimed to utilize measured data only and achieve a robust FRF decoupling scheme. AD is derived from a widely used coupling technique called “Receptance Coupling” (RC). The AD core equation reverses the RC process and utilizes a pair of auxiliary equations that enable the core equation to be resolved based on measured data only. In AD, the decoupled component FRFs are extracted from the coupled system FRFs with a transformation to remove the contribution of the “subtractive component”. This paper addresses the AD’s operational flexibility to resolve SLS free-free modal properties from coupled system measured data but also the possibility to include data from FEM if there is enough confidence in the FEM or if it is asserted that the effect to the final outcome is reasonable."

Since the blob’s NH is significantly larger than that of the binary we conclude15that the blob and binary are not directly related.  The somewhat larger very deep XRT image suggests16that the binary may be located within a shell (or cavity).  The four ACIS spectra taken within the∼2017day interval near the light curve minimum suggests that the NH is varying on timescales of days, pos-18sibly due to the inhomogenous circumbinary environment.  The XRT spectra extracted from the wider19orbital  phase  intervals  support  significant  changes  in NH near  the  light  curve  maximum/minimum,20which may be responsible for the substantial systematic residuals seen near 1 keV, and provide tenta-21tive evidence for a Fe line at 6.4 keV. We find no significant periodic signal in the ACIS data up to 0.156 Hz."

This research effort was jointly sponsored by NASA, FAA and ONERA and was supported by Boeing and the Universities of Illinois, Virginia, and Washington.  The overall goal of this research was to improve the experimental and computational simulation capability for icing on large swept wings typical of commercial transports.  This research included both ice accretion and aerodynamic studies using the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) as the reference geometry.  For this work, a 65% scaled version—CRM65—was used as the full-scale baseline airplane geometry.  This program marks the first non-proprietary research to generate and document full-scale swept wing ice accretions in an icing tunnel and then conduct semispan wing aerodynamic testing on scaled ice accretions at high Reynolds number (i.e., up to 11.9×106).  During this work, several new experimental and computational techniques were developed or documented and new knowledge about swept wing icing aerodynamics was identified.  All are documented in this report."

Observations from the Korea United States-Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) field campaign in May and June 2016 showed that development of extreme pollution (haze) occurred through a combination of long-range transport and favorable meteorological conditions that enhanced local production of PM2.5. Atmospheric models often have difficulty simulating PM2.5 chemical composition during haze, which is of concern for the development of successful control measures. We use observations from KORUS-AQ to examine the ability of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to simulate PM2.5 composition throughout the campaign and identify the mechanisms driving the pollution event. At the surface, the model underestimates sulfate by -64% but overestimates nitrate by +36%. The largest underestimate in sulfate occurs during the pollution event, where models typically struggle to generate elevated sulfate concentrations due to missing heterogeneous chemistry in aerosol liquid water in the polluted boundary layer. Hourly surface observations show that the model nitrate bias is driven by an overestimation of the nighttime peak. In the model, nitrate formation is limited by the supply of nitric acid, which is biased by +100% against aircraft observations. We hypothesize that this is due to a large missing sink, which we implement here as a factor of five increase in dry deposition. We show that the resulting increased deposition velocity is consistent with observations of total nitrate as a function of photochemical age. The model does not account for factors such as the urban heat island effect or the heterogeneity of the built-up urban landscape resulting in insufficient model turbulence and surface area over the study area that likely results in insufficient dry deposition. Other species such as NH3 could be similarly affected but were not measured during the campaign. Nighttime production of nitrate is driven by NO2 hydrolysis in the model, while observations show that unexpectedly elevated nighttime ozone (not present in the model) should result in N2O5 hydrolysis as the primary pathway. The model is unable to represent nighttime ozone due to an overly rapid collapse of the afternoon mixed layer and excessive titration by NO. We attribute this to missing nighttime heating driving deeper nocturnal mixing that would be expected to occur in a city like Seoul. This urban heating is not considered in air quality models run at large enough scales to treat both local chemistry and long-range transport. Key model failures in simulating nitrate, mainly overestimated daytime nitric acid, incorrect representation of nighttime chemistry, and an overly shallow and insufficiently turbulent nighttime mixed layer, exacerbate the model’s inability to simulate the buildup of PM2.5 during haze pollution. To address the underestimate in sulfate most evident during the haze event, heterogeneous aerosol uptake of SO2 is added to the model which previously only considered aqueous production of sulfate from SO2 in cloud water. Implementing a simple parameterization of this chemistry improves the model abundance of sulfate but degrades the SO2 simulation implying that emissions are underestimated. We find that improving model simulations of sulfate has direct relevance to determining local vs. transboundary contributions to PM2.5. During the haze pollution event, the inclusion of heterogeneous aerosol uptake of SO2 decreases the fraction of PM2.5 attributable to long-range transport from 66% to 54%. Locally-produced sulfate increased from 1% to 25% of locally-produced PM2.5, implying that local emissions controls would have a larger effect than previously thought. However, this additional uptake of SO2 is coupled to the model nitrate prediction which affects the aerosol liquid water abundance and chemistry driving sulfate-nitrate-ammonium partitioning. An additional simulation of the haze pollution with heterogeneous uptake of SO2 to aerosol and simple improvements to the model nitrate simulation results in 30% less sulfate due to 40% less nitrate and aerosol water, and results in an underestimate of sulfate during the haze event. Future studies need to better consider the impact of model physical processes such as dry deposition and nighttime boundary layer mixing on the simulation of nitrate and the effect of improved nitrate simulations on the overall simulation of secondary inorganic aerosol (sulfate+nitrate+ammonium) in East Asia. Foreign emissions are rapidly changing, increasing the need to understand the impact of local emissions on PM2.5 in South Korea to ensure continued air quality improvements."

Moreover, the successful implementation of a technology drives its possibilities. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has invested in numerous technologies over the decades. A quote from NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorates indicates the importance of technology: “Historically, technology has driven humanity’s progress and will continue to define our future. Our nation chooses to invest in new technology not only to maintain our edge in the global economy but also because technology helps us: Redefine the possible; Create a technologically advanced future; and Drive economic growth.” It is difficult for a technology to satisfy these goals unless it can be successfully infused into a system. For a technology to continue to evolve, become a reality, and infuse into NASA’s missions, there must exist a compilation of success-oriented factors for the technology to reach fruition. Understanding these factors could help decrease the complexity of technology infusion and bridge the gap between technology developers and system integrators. Ultimately, the knowledge gained could facilitate the design, development, and infusion of a technology to be more effective and efficient. Successful technology infusion is complex. Even complexity at the interfaces can be daunting when advanced technology’s infuse into complex systems such as a spacesuit. Additionally, unforeseen emergent behavior and challenges can surface upon integration. Overall, there is a need to understand and measure the success of infusing an advanced technology into a complex system. Industry and academia desire to quantify performance benefits of technologies integrated into complex systems. This paper will focus advanced technology infusion into a spacesuit system. This research could help NASA and industry’s project managers and system mangers integrate advanced technologies more effectively and efficiently."

This paper describes processor-in-the-loop (PIL) testing using a lunar landing scenario with terrain relative navigation (TRN) and weak-signal GPS. We give an overview of the autoNGC project and describe preliminary navigation simulation results. We also describe the TRN PIL tests on a flight-like development board, using simulated images rendered from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbit high-resolution digital terrain models. The navigation simulations show that weak-signal GPS combined with TRN during a descent from a low lunar parking orbit results in sufficiently low navigation uncertainties to support such a mission profile independent of ground-based navigation. The PIL tests show that onboard image processing and landmark correlation is achievable at a sufficiently high measurement rate."

The model geometry and the flow conditions are selected to match the experiments conducted in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel (BAM6QT) at Purdue University. The geometry consists of a nominally sharp 5-degree half-angle cone, followed by a cylindrical segment and then a 10-degree flare. An axisymmetric separation bubble is generated as a result of the laminar shock/boundary-layer interaction in the cylinder-flare region. The comparison of the laminar flow solution and the schlieren images shows a remarkable agreement between the respective locations of both the boundarylayer edge and the reattachment shock. The predicted heat flux distribution is also in agreement with the measured values downstream of the reattachment location. The analysis of convective and global instabilities is performed for flare half angles equal to 8, 10, and 12 degrees and nosetip radii equal to 0.1, 1, and 5 mm. The linear amplification of first and second Mack mode instabilities that begin to amplify in the cone region are computed with a combination of the parabolized stability equations (PSE) and the harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE). The predicted frequency spectra of the surface pressure fluctuations associated with both planar and oblique instability waves are compared with the measured spectra at the various locations of the PCB and Kulite sensors. The comparison shows that the computational analysis captures the distinct lobes within the disturbance amplification spectra measured in the experiments, but some differences in amplification characteristics are noted at low frequencies. Overall, the oblique disturbances are found to be more amplified than the planar disturbances. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful comparison between convective instability analysis and measured surface pressure fluctuations for a hypersonic configuration with a separation bubble. Finally, the global instability analysis shows that the laminar flow becomes supercritical for flare half angles larger than 8 degrees. The unstable global mode for the experimental configuration of a 10 degrees flare and a sharp nosetip cone corresponds to a stationary three-dimensional disturbance that is concentrated in the recirculation region and achieves its maximum growth rate for an azimuthal wavenumber of 5."

However, given the size of most LV systems, free-free testing is a challenge and often not feasible. With this, a test stand, typically the launch pad itself, is introduced as the means of support. This shifts the challenge to developing robust numerical methods for removing the influence of the launch pad from the integrated system modal test. The Space Launch System (SLS) is no exception where the mobile launcher (ML) is used to support the vehicle for the integrated modal test (IMT). For the IMT, it is well understood from pre-test analysis with finite element models (FEMs) of the SLS and SLS coupled to ML that the ML has a significant influence on the SLS modal properties especially in the lower frequency range where the primary SLS bending modes exist. An accelerance decoupling (AD) method has been formulated for the purpose of “subtracting out” the influence of the ML from the IMT results. With AD, the SLS decoupled frequency response functions (FRFs) are directly extracted from the IMT FRFs. The subject approach is aimed to utilize measured data only and achieve a robust FRF decoupling scheme. AD is derived from a widely used coupling technique called “Receptance Coupling” (RC). The AD core equation reverses the RC process and utilizes a pair of auxiliary equations that enable the core equation to be resolved based on measured data only. In AD, the decoupled component FRFs are extracted from the coupled system FRFs with a transformation to remove the contribution of the “subtractive component”. This paper addresses the AD’s operational flexibility to resolve SLS free-free modal properties from coupled system measured data but also the possibility to include data from FEM if there is enough confidence in the FEM or if it is asserted that the effect to the final outcome is reasonable."

Executive Order (EO) 13972, “Promoting Small Modular Reactors for National Defense and Space Exploration” [1], issued 5 January 2021, directs NASA to define requirements for NASA utilization of nuclear energy systems for human and robotic exploration missions through 2040 and analyze the costs and benefits of such requirements.” Although it is premature to define requirements and cost for future exploration missions that have not yet been formulated, this report describes planned objectives and missions by 2040 that are enabled or enhanced by nuclear systems while taking into account a number of unique considerations for nuclear energy in the space environment. Nuclear energy systems are enabling for space missions and critical capabilities where conventional forms of energy production are impractical or impossible due to mass constraints, mission duration, or distance from the Sun.

Space nuclear technologies available or in development for use by 2040 utilize radioisotope decay or nuclear fission and fall into three categories: heat, power, and propulsion. Current applications utilize radioisotope power systems that provide consistent and reliable performance in the sub-kilowatt power range. More advanced SNS can enable new mission objectives where high energy density solutions are critical, or where access to solar solutions is prohibitive. Higher power radioisotope and fission systems are under development within NASA for a wide variety of human exploration and science mission applications. Planned missions designed to use radioisotope systems include Dragonfly, a rotorcraft that will explore the surface of Titan, and Persephone, a mission concept for a Pluto orbiter. Nuclear fission systems have the key advantage of providing significantly higher power, lower mass solutions from tens to even thousands of kilowatts. Fission power is enabling to a sustained human presence on the Moon and developing a robust lunar economy. Fission propulsion is enabling for missions within and beyond cis-lunar space.

This report examines NASA-envisioned mission applications and associated performance needs for SNS over the next twenty years leading to 2040 along with the unique technical considerations posed by space nuclear technology development. This includes engineering and operational logistics for ground handling, thermal management, survival of the space environment, operational safety, power requirements, and service longevity. Safety to the public, the NASA work force, and agency assets remains a top priority for NASA and particular attention is given to this aspect in the design, hardware assembly, ground operation, launch, and mission operation of an SNS. NASA relies on the Department of Energy as nuclear authority and its legacy of rigorous safety procedures as standards for ground development, test, transportation, and launch site operation. The principal concern is preventing unintended radiological release to the public or environment. Radioisotope system experience has established processes, including ground operation, transportation, and launch, that are considered directly applicable to emerging fission systems; however, fission systems have unique design needs that impact the safety and performance requirements.

High efficiency power conversion from both fission and radioisotope systems requires high operating temperatures necessitating both passive and active thermal management to maintain safe and nominal operating conditions. Effective cooling and waste heat rejection have special considerations for space applications, whether in zero-g or reduced gravity. Fluid and heat transfer within the reactor system is not anticipated to be impacted by reduced or zero-g environments. Cryogenic working fluids and propellant supplies utilized in some space nuclear applications will need low mass, high capacity cryocoolers to meet the long-term storage and near zero-boiloff needs. Integrated, high power density SNS capable of being packaged in a single vehicle is a key consideration for NASA. Due to concerns for complexity and reliability, in space reactor assembly and reactor refueling are not current design considerations.

Expanding into a new era for space exploration depends on mass-efficient, high-energy solutions to power deep-space vehicles, operate in harsh environments, and increase mission flexibility. NASA nuclear technology investments are targeting power for surface operations and propulsion for fast-transit, deep-space missions, all with the ability to reliably operate without the need for repair or refueling. NASA’s goals, enabled by nuclear technologies, provide for exciting advances in scientific objectives and human exploration, ushering in a new space age that enables a human presence on bodies beyond our Earth."

Earth’s atmosphere has several layers that expose microbial and terrestrial life to harsh external environments. In order to study the limits of survival of microbial life in extremes, it is imperative to study the response of micro-organisms to space-related stress. The present chapter summarizes the various balloon and flight experiments performed to investigate the presence and response of microbial life in space. Studying the microbiome in the ISS is important as pathogenic bacteria can present a major risk to astronaut health in a closed environment. Hence, studying occurrence, ecology, diversity, response, and adaptations of microbial life in space is crucial to understanding the limits of organismic survival in inhospitable conditions. Studying microbial life in space also helps predict the plausible survival and endurance of microbial travel between planets, crucial to lithopanspermia theories and planetary protection."

By determining how elements partition between metal and silicate at high pressures and temperatures, measurements of the mantle composition and geophysical observations of the core can be used to understand the mechanisms by which Earth formed.  Here we present the results of metal–silicate partitioning experiments for a range of nominally lithophile elements (Al, Ca, K, Mg, O, S, Si, Th, U) and S to 85 GPa and up to 5400 K. With our results and a compilation of literature data, we developed a parameterization for partitioning that accounts for compositional dependencies in both the metal and silicate phases. Using this parameterization in a range of planetary growth models, we find that, in general, lithophile element partitioning into the metallic phase is enhanced at high temperatures. The relative abundances of FeO, SiO2 and MgO in the mantle vary significantly between planetary growth models, and the mantle abundances of these elements can be used to provide important constraints on Earth’s accretion. To match Earth’s core mass and mantle composition, Earth’s building blocks must have been enriched in Fe and depleted in Si compared with CI chondrites. Finally, too little Mg, Si and O are partitioned into the core for precipitation of oxides to be a major source of energy for
 the geodynamo. In contrast, several ppb of U can be partitioned into the core at high temperatures, and this energy source must be accounted for in thermal evolution models."

However, the variability and drivers of measured and modeled water isotopologues, as well as the diversity of their representation in different models, are not well constrained. Improving our understanding of this variability in past and present climates will help to better constrain future climate change projections and decrease their range of uncertainty. Speleothems are a precisely datable terrestrial paleoclimate archives and provide well-preserved (semi-)continuous multivariate isotope time series in the lower latitudes and mid-latitudes and are therefore well suited to assess climate and isotope variability on decadal and longer timescales. However, the relationships of speleothem oxygen and carbon isotopes to climate variables are influenced by site-specific parameters, and their comparison to GCMs is not always straightforward.

Here we compare speleothem oxygen and carbon isotopic signatures from the Speleothem Isotopes Synthesis and Analysis database version 2 (SISALv2) to the output of five different water-isotope-enabled GCMs (ECHAM5-wiso, GISS-E2-R, iCESM, iHadCM3, and isoGSM) over the last millennium (850–1850 CE). We systematically evaluate differences and commonalities between the standardized model simulation outputs. The goal is to distinguish climatic drivers of variability for modeled isotopes and compare them to those of measured isotopes.

We find strong regional differences in the oxygen isotope signatures between models that can partly be attributed to differences in modeled surface temperature. At low latitudes, precipitation amount is the dominant driver for stable water isotope variability; however, at cave locations the agreement between modeled temperature variability is higher than for precipitation variability. While modeled isotopic signatures at cave locations exhibited extreme events coinciding with changes in volcanic and solar forcing, such fingerprints are not apparent in the speleothem isotopes. This may be attributed to the lower temporal resolution of speleothem records compared to the events that are to be detected. Using spectral analysis, we can show that all models underestimate decadal and longer variability compared to speleothems (albeit to varying extents).

We found that no model excels in all analyzed comparisons, although some perform better than the others in either mean or variability. Therefore, we advise a multi-model approach whenever comparing proxy data to modeled data. Considering karst and cave internal processes, e.g., through isotope-enabled karst models, may alter the variability in speleothem isotopes and play an important role in determining the most appropriate model. By exploring new ways of analyzing the relationship between the oxygen and carbon isotopes, their variability, and co-variability across timescales, we provide methods that may serve as a baseline for future studies with different models using, e.g., different isotopes, different climate archives, or different time periods."

Although in-situ observations provide accurate ET information, these records are spatially sparse. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Midwest Climate Hub, National Integrated Drought Information System, Minnesota Department of Agriculture, Michigan State University, and the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service have partnered with DEVELOP to gain new insights on spatiotemporal patterns of ET with NASA satellite data. This project evaluates the feasibility of using remotely sensed ET data products to understand trends from 2001 through 2020. Actual ET (aET) data were sourced from NASA’s Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and reference ET (refET) and precipitation data were sourced from the Gridded Surface Meteorological Dataset (gridMET). Spatial and temporal differences in the MODIS and gridMET data sets were resolved such that gridded data could be compared. These data sets were then used to produce monthly Normals maps of mm/8-day of precipitation, aET, and refET. Using precipitation and ET Normals maps, hydrologic state maps were produced by subtracting either refET or aET from precipitation. These hydrologic state maps provide a proxy water balance by summarizing the difference between water entering and leaving the ground surface. Additionally, the ET products were compared in timeseries plots. The ET products from this project provided partners with comparable datasets to assess potential drought and flooding conditions to support Midwest agricultural and natural resource managers in decision-making."

These data assimilation systems are critical to the success of global numerical weather prediction systems including the Global Earth Observing System-Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS-ADAS). Extending more surface sensitive microwave channels over land, snow and ice could provide a needed source of data for Numerical Weather Prediction particularly in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). Unfortunately, the accuracy of emissivity models currently available within the GEOS-ADAS along with other data assimilation systems are insufficient to simulate and assimilate radiances.  Recently,  Munchak et al. (2020) published a 5-year climatological database for retrieved microwave emissivity from the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) aboard the Global Precipitation Mission (GPM). In this work the database is utilized by modifying the GEOS-ADAS to use this emissivity database in place of the default emissivity value available in the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), which is the fast radiative transfer model used by the GEOS-ADAS. As a first step, the GEOS-ADAS is run in a so-called “stand-alone” mode to simulate radiances from GMI using the default CRTM emissivity, and replacing the default CRTM emissivity models with values from Munchak et al, 2020. The simulated observations using Munchak et al., 2020 agree more closely with observations from GMI. These results are presented along with a discussion of the implication for GMI observations within the GEOS-ADAS."

The smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean and listed as Endangered in the US Endangered Species Act. One of its major threats is bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries.

2.Despite the protection afforded by the US Endangered Species Act, smalltooth sawfish are still captured as bycatch in commercial fisheries. Acoustic and satellite tag data collected on 59 sawfish between 2011 and 2019 were analysed to assess commercial fishery bycatch risk for large juveniles and adults off Florida. This study focused on shrimp trawl, south-east coastal gillnet, and shark bottom longline fisheries, as these were identified in the recovery plan as having the greatest potential threats to recovery.

3.Bycatch risk associated with the shrimp trawl fishery was significantly higher than the other fisheries, indicating that this fishery currently poses the greatest threat to recovery.

4.Bycatch risk was concentrated in all seasons in the Gulf of Mexico adjacent to the lower Florida Keys for the shrimp trawl fishery, off Cape Canaveral in the south-east coastal gillnet fishery, and in the Atlantic Ocean adjacent to the Florida Keys in the shark bottom longline fishery.

5.Tagging location and sex were predictors of bycatch risk. Individuals tagged in Charlotte Harbor had the highest shrimp trawl bycatch risk. Females tagged in south Florida tended to reside in the deepest water, which is where shrimp trawl effort is highest. Therefore, females may be at more risk in these deeper waters.

6.Results from this study indicate a year-round closure of waters off south-west Florida to the shrimp trawl fishery between Charlotte Harbor and the western Florida Keys would reduce sawfish bycatch, and thus mortality, which is in line with recovery plan goals."

This study develops a new methodology to validate the IMERG precipitation products through the use of SMAP soil moisture changes as a proxy for precipitation occurrence. Using a standard 2x2 contingency table method, preliminary results provide confidence in SMAP’s ability to be utilized as a validation tool for IMERG as results are comparable to previous validation studies. However, the method allows for an overestimate of false alarm frequency due to light precipitation events that can evaporate before the subsequent SMAP overpass and changes in overpass-to-overpass SMAP soil moisture that are within the range of SMAP uncertainty. To counter these issues, a 3x3 contingency table is used to reduce noise and extract more signal from the detection method. Through the use of this novel approach, the validation method produces a global mean POD of 0.64 and global mean FAR of 0.40, the first global-scale ground validation skill scores for the IMERG products. Advancing the method to validate precipitation quantity and the development of a real-time validation for the IMERG Early product are the crucial next developments."

structures with fewer welds and reduced machining requirements. Two such methods that are
suitable for the manufacturing of single-piece, stiffened barrel-shaped structures are presented.
The first solution deployed existing manufacturing technology to produce a thick-walled barrel
with integrally machined stiffeners. In this study, an 8-ft. diameter barrel was produced and
subjected to a buckling test. Data on the manufacturing and testing of this barrel are provided and
compared against the traditional multi-piece weld construction approach. The single-piece barrel
resulted in a 28% greater load carrying capacity than the welded barrel.

A second solution utilized a novel flow-forming technique to produce the barrel and stiffeners
in one process without the need for welding or machining. This is an emerging manufacturing
method known as the Integrally Stiffened Cylinder (ISC) process. This innovative process is being
evaluated for launch vehicle and commercial aircraft manufacturing. The one-piece, stiffened ISC
barrels, which have been successfully fabricated at 10 ft. in diameter, offer a direct replacement
for conventional multi-piece, welded or riveted structures. A cost-benefit analysis for launch
vehicle cryogenic propellant tanks estimated that the ISC process offers up to a 50% reduction
in manufacturing costs and a 10% reduction in mass."

The current state-of-the-art in flow forming of ISCs produces 10-ft. diameter, 5-ft. long barrels with integral longitudinal blade stiffeners, and these single-piece ISCs are produced in approximately 1.5 hours.  While other manufacturing processes are required to incorporate additional structural elements (ASE) such as circumferential ring frames, reinforcements around window and door cut-outs, and floors to the ISCs to complete the fuselage structure, flow forming technology may assist the aerospace industry in meeting manufacturing rate demands.  In order to evaluate this technology, a fuselage manufacturing demonstration article (MDA) fabricated from two ISCs is scheduled for fabrication and delivery to NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) by the end of 2022.

In this study, eight manufacturing technologies were assessed to downselect candidate manufacturing processes for adding ASE to complete the MDA.  A literature review and evaluation of contractor-produced panels covering a spectrum of welding and additive manufacturing (AM) processes were conducted at NASA LaRC.  The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to evaluate figures of merit (FOMs) for selecting manufacturing process(es) to integrate ASE with the ISCs to form a fuselage MDA.  The AHP results revealed that scalability, structural performance, and distortion control were the most valued criteria for downselecting the manufacturing process to construct the internal stiffening structures.  Based on the FOMs, this study concluded that a welding process is best suited for integrating the majority of the ASE, namely the circumferential ring frames.  All of the welding processes received higher scores than AM processes due to higher maturity, higher structural performance, fewer post-processing requirements in machining and heat treating, and faster deposition rates.

Among the welding processes, cold metal transfer (CMT) welding was ranked the most favorable process for assembling the MDA, with the other welding processes (laser welding (LW), friction stir welding (FSW), and refill friction stir spot welding (RFSSW)) scoring slightly lower.  This was a consequence of the perceived maturity of the CMT welding process and its relatively high structural performance and low distortion resulting from the low heat input.  

Among the AM processes, CMT AM showed the greatest promise due to benefits derived from its scalability, lower 1st order process complexity, and low distortion.  The AM processes may have potential for select applications, such as adding structural reinforcements around window and door cut-outs, but are not considered optimal for integrating the entire MDA."

The design task involves sizing the rotorcraft to satisfy specified design conditions and missions. The analysis tasks can include off-design mission performance analysis, flight performance calculation for point operating conditions, and generation of subsystem or component performance maps. Figure 1-1 illustrates the tasks. The principal tasks (sizing, mission analysis, flight performance analysis) are shown in the figure as boxes with heavy borders. Heavy arrows show control of subordinate tasks.

The aircraft description (figure 1-1) consists of all the information, input and derived, that defines the aircraft. The aircraft consists of a set of components, including fuselage, rotors, wings, tails, and propulsion. This information can be the result of the sizing task; can come entirely from input, for a fixed model; or can come from the sizing task in a previous case or previous job. The aircraft description information is available to all tasks and all solutions (indicated by light arrows). 

The sizing task determines the dimensions, power, and weight of a rotorcraft that can perform a specified set of design conditions and missions. The aircraft size is characterized by parameters such as design gross weight, weight empty, rotor radius, and engine power available. The relations between dimensions, power, and weight generally require an iterative solution. From the design flight conditions and missions, the task can determine the total engine power or the rotor radius (or both power and radius can be fixed), as well as the design gross weight, maximum takeoff weight, drive system torque limit, and fuel tank capacity. For each propulsion group, the engine power or the rotor radius can be sized.

Missions are defined for the sizing task, and for the mission performance analysis. A mission consists of a number of mission segments, for which time, distance, and fuel burn are evaluated. For the sizing task, certain missions are designated to be used for design gross weight calculations; for transmission sizing; and for fuel tank sizing. The mission parameters include mission takeoff gross weight and useful load. For specified takeoff fuel weight with adjustable segments, the mission time or distance is adjusted so the fuel required for the mission (burned plus reserve) equals the takeoff fuel weight. The mission iteration is on fuel weight or energy.

Flight conditions are specified for the sizing task, and for the flight performance analysis. For the sizing task, certain flight conditions are designated to be used for design gross weight calculations; for transmission sizing; for maximum takeoff weight calculations; and for antitorque or auxiliary thrust rotor sizing. The flight condition parameters include gross weight and useful load.

For flight conditions and mission takeoff, the gross weight can be maximized, such that the power required equals the power available.

A flight state is defined for each mission segment and each flight condition. The aircraft performance can be analyzed for the specified state, or a maximum effort performance can be identified. The maximum effort is specified in terms of a quantity such as best endurance or best range, and a variable such as speed, rate of climb, or altitude. The aircraft must be trimmed, by solving for the controls and motion that produce equilibrium in the specified flight state. Different trim solution definitions are required for various flight states. Evaluating the rotor hub forces may require solution of the blade flap equations of motion."

However, experimental observations suggest that such an assumption may not hold in general. The approach described herein consists of a cohesive element formulation in which the assumption of identical Mode II and Mode III fracture processes is not required. This assumption is alleviated by estimating the normal to the delamination front based on the gradient of the displacement jumps determined within each element. The estimated normal is used to rotate the cohesive element coordinate system. Determining the displacement jumps in the rotated coordinate system enables the distinction between Mode II sliding, and Mode III tearing. This information is subsequently used to extend a recently proposed cohesive formulation, resulting in an approach that can simulate mixed-mode I/II/III fracture via prescribing piecewise-linear traction-separation laws combined with a 3D mixed-mode fracture criteria."

The MSR Campaign is an international partnership that will result in delivery of the first martian samples to Earth that were not delivered through meteoritic infall. All meteorites, regardless of how they were handled from recovery to curation, have experienced uncontrolled entry and exposure to the terrestrial environment. Whilst meteorite deliveries are serendipitous, they are also unplanned events that require reactionary responses for recovery and curation. However, with the direct return of pristine astromaterials from another body, we are afforded the ability to design a facility in advance of sample delivery to keep those samples in a pristine (i.e., as returned) state for an indefinite period of time. 
	Given that the curation and processing infrastructure needs to be made out of something, it is important to choose materials for the pristine curation environment that will optimize between the need to effectively process samples and the need to minimize contamination of the samples. The Johnson Space Center (JSC) has an optimized list of materials that have been used in previous sample return missions that includes 304/316 Stainless Steel, Teflon, and T6061 Aluminum (1). This set of materials are compatible with inorganic, organic, and biological cleanliness requirements and protocols. Furthermore, only these materials are permitted to come in contact with pristine samples. We note that JSC uses Neoprene and Hypalon for the gloves on their gloveboxes, but the glove material never comes in direct contact with the samples, only the approved materials. The MSR sample tubes will be made of Ti, so Ti may be an acceptable material for making tools, but the minor and trace element abundances of 304 and 316 stainless steel are well known and do not inhibit scientific investigations of metals, including HSE (2). More work is needed to determine whether the same is true for Ti alloys.
In addition to defining the materials in the pristine environment, one must also choose whether the pristine environment will be under vacuum or under a specific atmospheric composition and pressure. Although JAXA has successfully implemented pristine curation vacuum chambers for their Hayabusa and Hayabusa2 samples (3), a vacuum environment is not appropriate for martian samples because it may drive deliquescence of mineral phases in the samples that are sensitive to pressure and relative humidity (4). Consequently, the pristine environment for the martian samples should be under an inert gas. It will be crucial to minimize the number of gases that come into direct contact with samples and these gases will need to be high purity and consistent throughout the pristine isolators. Samples at JSC are stored under high purity gaseous nitrogen (1). Dry N2 gas has not been a problem for N isotope studies for high-T release phases, but an additional inert atmosphere like Ar may be needed for samples where there is a particular concern about low-T release of N from bulk sample analysis.

The objective of our work was to assess spatiotemporal variability in water storage and related controls (climate, human intervention) in major African aquifers and consider approaches toward more sustainable development. Different approaches were used to track water storage, including GRACE/GRACE Follow On satellites for Total Water Storage (TWS); satellite altimetry for reservoir storage, MODIS satellites for vegetation indices, and limited ground-based monitoring. Results show that declining trends in TWS (60–73 km3 over the 18 yr GRACE record) were restricted to aquifers in northern Africa, controlled primarily by irrigation water use in the Nubian and NW Saharan aquifers. Rising TWS trends were found in aquifers in western Africa (23–49 km3), attributed to increased recharge from land use change and cropland expansion. Interannual variability dominated TWS variability in eastern and southern Africa, controlled primarily by climate extremes. Climate teleconnections, particularly El Nino Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole, strongly controlled droughts and floods in eastern and southern Africa. Huge aquifer storage in northern Africa suggests that the recent decadal storage declines should not impact the regional aquifers but may affect local conditions. Increasing groundwater levels in western Africa will need to be managed because of locally rising groundwater flooding. More climate resilient water management can be accomplished in eastern and southern Africa by storing water from wet to dry climate cycles. Accessing the natural water storage provided by aquifers in Africa is the obvious way to manage the variability between droughts and floods."

Quantifying spaceflight renal stone incidence risk compared to pre-flight levels remains a significant challenge for assessing the appropriate vehicle, mission, and countermeasure design.  A computational biochemistry model representing CaOx crystal precipitation, growth, and agglomeration is combined with a probabilistic analysis to predict the in- and post-flight CaOx renal stone incidence risk ratio (IRR) relative to pre-flight values using 1517 astronaut 24-hour urine chemistries. Our simulations predict that in-flight fluid intake alone would need to increase from current prescriptions of 2.0 - 2.5 L/day to approximately 3.2 L/day to approach CaOx IRR of the pre-flight population. Bone protective interventions would reduce CaOx risk to pre-flight levels if Ca excretion alone is reduced to < 150 mg/day or if current levels are diminished to 190mg/day in combination with increasing fluid intake to 2.5 - 2.7 L/day.  This analysis provides a quantitative risk assessment that can influence the critical balance between engineering and astronaut health requirements."

Managing finite water resources to support these designated uses requires information on water quality so that managers can make sustainable decisions. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a, µg L−1) concentration can serve as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and may be used as an indicator of increased anthropogenic nutrient stress. Satellite remote sensing may present a complement to in situ measures for assessments of water quality through the retrieval of chl-a with in-water algorithms. Validation of chl-a algorithms across US lakes improves algorithm maturity relevant for monitoring applications. This study compares performance of the Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) chl-a retrieval algorithm, a revised version of the Maximum-Peak Height (MPH(P)) algorithm, and three scenarios merging these two approaches. Satellite data were retrieved from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), while field observations were obtained from 181 lakes matched with U.S. Water Quality Portal chl-a data. The best performance based on mean absolute multiplicative error (MAEmult) was demonstrated by the merged algorithm referred to as C15−M10 (MAEmult = 1.8, biasmult = 0.97, n = 836). In the C15−M10 algorithm, the MPH(P) chl-a value was retained if it was > 10 µg L−1; if the MPH(P) value was ≤ 10 µg L−1, the C2RCC value was selected, as long as that value was < 15 µg L−1. Time-series and lake-wide gradients compared against independent assessments from Lake Champlain and long-term ecological research stations in Wisconsin were used as complementary examples supporting water quality reporting requirements. Trophic state assessments for Wisconsin lakes provided examples in support of inland water quality monitoring applications. This study presents and assesses merged adaptations of chl-a algorithms previously reported independently. Additionally, it contributes to the transition of chl-a algorithm maturity by quantifying error statistics for a number of locations and times."

As the most water-rich body in the inner solar system, it is a representative of a population of planetesimals that were likely a significant source of volatiles and organics to the inner solar system. Here we describe possible medium-class (around $1 billion) mission concepts that would determine both Ceres’ origin and its current habitability potential. Habitability is addressed through a combination
of geological, geophysical, and compositional investigations by (i) searching for evidence from orbit of past and ongoing geological activity near landforms interpreted as brine-driven volcanic structures and (ii) probing the brine distribution below one of these regions with electromagnetic sounding (in situ). Two approaches were considered for compositional measurements, which address both habitability and origins: (1) in situ exploration at two sites and (2) sample return from a single site. Both concepts targeted material at Occator crater, which is one of the
youngest features on Ceres (∼20 Ma) and a site rich in evaporites evolved from recently erupted brine sourced from a region >35 km deep. We conclude that a sample return architecture from these young evaporite deposits offers greater science return by enabling high-resolution analysis of organic matter (trapped in salt minerals) and isotopes of refractory elements for a similar cost and less science risk than in situ analyses. This manuscript describes the six science objectives and the two implementation concepts considered to achieve those objectives."

However, our diffusion calculations show that such AOA olivine zoning and compositions cannot be produced by a simple diffusional exchange during metamorphic heating, unlike chondrule olivine zoning and compositions. In addition, fine-grained ferroan olivine overgrowths occur heterogeneously in crystallographic continuity with olivines on the AOA exteriors. The overgrowths (Fa33-36) are compositionally distinct from the underlying AOA olivines and are not fully equilibrated with the matrix olivines (Fa~20-55).The ferroan olivine overgrowths likely formed by precipitation from fluids in an epitaxial relationship with forsteritic olivine on the edges of AOAs. Texturally and compositionally diverse chromite grains are also observed along olivine grain boundaries, in olivine grains, and in pore spaces between olivine grains. They share a similar crystallographic orientation relationships with adjacent olivine, suggestive of their formation by exsolution and/or epitaxial growth. Collectively, these observations provide evidence for the mobilization of Fe, Mg, Si, Cr, and Al in the presence of fluids along olivine grain boundaries and into olivine grains during thermal metamorphism. We conclude that in Kainsaz AOAs, the strong zonation development in individual olivine grains and the formation of ferroan olivine overgrowths and chromite grains were a fluid-driven process that occurred at relatively low temperatures (<500°C), during the cooling history of the CO3 chondrite parent body, following the peak of thermal metamorphism."

The predictive capabilities of ML models have already been used to facilitate several scientific breakthroughs. However, the practical application of ML is often limited due to the gaps in technical knowledge of its users. The common issue faced by many scientific  researchers is the inability to choose the appropriate ML pipelines that are needed to treat real-world data, which is often sparse and noisy. To solve this problem, we have developed an automated Machine Learning tool (MLtool) that includes a set of ML algorithms and approaches to aid scientific researchers. The current version of MLtool is implemented as an object-oriented Python code that is easily extensible. It includes 44 different regression algorithms used to model data. MLtool helps users select the best model for their data, based on the scoring metrics used. Besides regression algorithms, MLtool also includes a suite of pre-  and  post-processing techniques such as missing value imputation, categorical variable encoding, input feature normalization, uncertainty quantification, exploratory data analysis (EDA), etc. MLtool was tested on several publicly available multi-dimensional data sets and was found capable of making accurate predictions."

This estimation approach has previously been applied to an intermediate-complexity climate model and to individual ESM components, e.g., ocean, sea ice, or carbon cycle components. Here, the Green's functions approach is applied to a state-of-the-art ESM that comprises a global atmosphere/land configuration of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) coupled to an ocean and sea ice configuration of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm). Horizontal grid spacing is approximately 110 km for GEOS and 37–110 km for MITgcm. In addition to the reference GEOS-MITgcm simulation, we carried out a series of model sensitivity experiments, in which 20 uncertain parameters are perturbed. These “control” parameters can be used to adjust sea ice, microphysics, turbulence, radiation, and surface schemes in the coupled simulation. We defined eight observational targets: sea ice fraction, net surface shortwave radiation, downward longwave radiation, near-surface temperature, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and ocean temperature and salinity at 300 m. We applied the Green's functions approach to optimize the values of the 20 control parameters so as to minimize a weighted least-squares distance between the model and the eight observational targets. The new experiment with the optimized parameters resulted in a total cost reduction of 9 % relative to a simulation that had already been adjusted using other methods. The optimized experiment attained a balanced cost reduction over most of the observational targets. We also report on results from a set of sensitivity experiments that are not used in the final optimized simulation but helped explore options and guided the optimization process. These experiments include an assessment of sensitivity to the number of control parameters and to the selection of observational targets and weights in the cost function. Based on these sensitivity experiments, we selected a specific definition for the cost function. The sensitivity experiments also revealed a decreasing overall cost as the number of control variables was increased. In summary, we recommend using the Green's functions estimation approach as an additional fine-tuning step in the model development process. The method is not a replacement for modelers' experience in choosing and adjusting sensitive model parameters. Instead, it is an additional practical and effective tool for carrying out final adjustments of uncertain ESM parameters."

Activation energies were calculated for atomic hydrogen (H) diffusion into the first subsurface layer from the lowest energy surface of the high-temperature phase of each candidate material. The candidate barrier materials with the highest activation energies are h-BN, c-BN, HfN, and ZrN with predicted barriers of 3.25 eV, 3.23 eV, 3.14 eV, and 2.76 eV, respectively. Strain energies, Bader charges, and density of states were calculated for the diffusing H at the relaxed initial state and the transition state to provide insight into contributing factors to high energy barriers. The diffusing H atom in materials with the highest predicted barriers are protic. In addition, interstitial H atoms induce mid-gap states in the density of states of both BN polymorphs. The nitrogen retention of each nitride material at high temperatures was predicted using nitrogen vacancy formation energies with respect to gaseous nitrogen. Experimental evaluation of nitrogen retention in h-BN, ZrN, and TiN confirmed their resistance to nitrogen loss at 1773 K. However, of these nitrides, TiN is predicted to be the least stable. This work identifies multiple promising materials that are predicted to be effective hydrogen barriers at high temperatures and that are stable at temperatures above 2700 K, with BN predicted to perform best."

Hematite and goethite column mass concentrations and iron-oxide mass fractions of total dust mass concentration were retrieved from the DeepSpace Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) measurements in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) channels. The retrievals were performed for dust-identified aerosol plumes over land using aerosol optical depth (AOD) and spectral imaginary refractive index provided by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm over six continental regions (North America, North Africa, West Asia, Central Asia, EastAsia, and Australia). The dust particles are represented as an internal mixture of non-absorbing host and absorbing hematite and goethite. We use the Maxwell–Garnett effective medium approximation with carefully selected complex refractive indices of hematite and goethite that produce mass fractions of iron oxides species consistent with in situ values found in the literature to derive the hematite and goethite volumetric/mass concentrations from MAIAC EPIC products. We compared the retrieved hematite and goethite concentrations with in situ dust aerosol mineralogical content measurements, as well as with published data. Our data display variations within the published range of hematite, goethite, and iron-oxide mass fractions for pure mineral dust cases. A specific analysis is presented for 15 sites over the main dust source regions. Sites in the central Sahara, Sahel, and Middle East exhibit a greater temporal variability of iron oxides relative to other sites. Niger site(13.52°N, 2.63°E) is dominated by goethite over Harmattan season with median of ~2 weight percentage (wt.%) of iron-oxide. Saudi Arabia site (27.49°N, 41.98°E) over Middle East also exhibited surge of goethite content with the beginning of Shamal season. The Sahel dust is richer in iron-oxide than Saharan and northern China dust except in Summer. The Bodélé Depression area shows a distinctively lower iron-oxide concentration (~1 wt.%) throughout the year. Finally, we show that EPIC data allow to constrain the hematite refractive index. Specifically, we select 5 out of 13 different number of hematite refractive indices widely variable in published laboratory studies by constraining the iron-oxide mass ratio to the known measured values. Provided climatology of hematite and goethite mass fractions across main dust regions of the Earth will be useful for dust shortwave DRE studies and climate modeling."

Our experiment ranged from 108 to 758 cm−1above the threshold energy to form NO (A)+N2(X) products, and these measurements reveal, for the first time, a strong angular anisotropy from photodissociation. At 108cm−1above the photodissociation threshold, we observed NO (A)photoproducts recoil preferentially perpendicular to the laser polarization axis with an average anisotropy parameter,β=−0.25; however, as the available energy was increased, the anisotropy increased, and at 758 cm−1above the threshold energy, we found an averageβ= +0.28. The observed changes in the angular anisotropy of the NO (A) photoproduct are qualitatively similar to those observed for the photodissociation of the Ar−NO complex and likely result from changes in the region of the excited state potential energy surface accessed during the electronic excitation. At the lowest available energy, we also noted a large contribution from hot band excitation; however, this contribution decreased as the available energy increased. The outsizedcontribution at the lowest available energy may result from hotbands having better Franck−Condon overlap with the excitedelectronic state near threshold. Finally, we contrast the experimental center of mass translational energy distribution with a statisticalenergy distribution determined from phase space theory. The experimental and statistical distributions show pronounceddisagreement, particularly at low kinetic energies, with the experimental one showing less dissociation resulting in high rotationallevels of the fragments."

To ensure adaptability within resource constraints, IV&V has developed an agile, risk-based approach to identify, characterize, scope, focus, and prioritize mission assurance activities. This risk based adaptive framework has been applied to trends such as increased reliance on data driven algorithms for safety and mission critical software behavior, use of MBSE in system design, and application of agile principles to embedded software development. The framework is enabled by continuous innovation of new approaches such as software only test beds, assurance design tools, and initiatives that augment IV&V assurance methods with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This presentation will highlight the trends the NASA IV&V Program is seeing, the innovative steps it is taking to address those challenges, and how it is postured to address evolving risk and constantly changing and new technologies."

Parts of the analyses made use of a large library of synthetic black hole images and spectra, which were produced using numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics fluid simulations and polarized ray tracing. In this article, we describe the PATOKA pipeline, which was used to generate the Illinois contribution to the EHT simulation library. We begin by describing the relevant accretion systems and radiative processes. We then describe the details of the three numerical codes we use, iharm, ipole, and igrmonty, paying particular attention to differences between the current generation of the codes and the originally published versions. Finally, we provide a brief overview of simulated data as produced by PATOKA and conclude with a discussion of limitations and future directions."

An airborne demonstration of CMIS was successfully completed in January-February 2021 on the NASA Langley Research Center Gulfstream III.  The primary objective of the four-flight campaign was to demonstrate the capability of this unique instrument to perform stereo observations of clouds and other particulates (e.g. smoke) in the atmosphere. It is shown that the midwave infrared (MWIR) spectral bands of CMIS provide a unique 24/7 capability with high resolution for accurate stereo sensing.The instrument relies on new focal plane array (FPA) technology, which provides excellent sensitivity at much warmer detector temperatures than traditional technologies. This capability enabled a compact, low-cost design that can provide atmospheric motion  vectors  and  cloud heights  to  support  requirements  for  atmospheric  winds  in  the  2017-2027 Earth Science Decadal Survey. Applications include day/night observations of the planetary boundary layer, severe weather, and wildfires. A comparison with current space-based earth science instruments demonstrates that the SWIR/MWIR multi-spectral capability of CMIS is competitive with larger,  more  expensive  instrumentation. Imagery obtained  over a  controlled  burn  and  operating nuclear power plant demonstrated the sensitivity of the instrument to temperature variations. The system relies on a mature stereoscopic imaging technique applied to the same scene from two independent platforms to unambiguously retrieve atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) with accurate height  assignment.This  capability  has  been  successfully  applied  to  geostationary  and  low-earth orbit satellites to achieve excellent accuracy. When applied to a ground-point validation case, the accuracy  for  the  CMIS  aircraft  observations  was  20  m  and  0.3  m/s  for  cloud  heights  and  motion vectors,  respectively.  This  result  was  confirmed  by  a  detailed  error  analysis  with analytical  and covariance models. The results for CMIS cases with under flights of Aeolus, CALIPSO and Aqua provided a good validation of expected accuracies. The paper also showed the feasibility of accommodating CMIS on CubeSats to enable multiple instruments to be flown in a leader-follower mode."

When a weather threat arises, a decision to evacuate the rig and/or move to a safe location may need to be made. Securing the well, evacuating, and/or moving to a safe location can take a considerable amount of time. This transition time is called T-time. T-time is not only rig dependent, but also depends on the activity being performed at the time of the threat. For these reasons, it is important to assess tropical cyclone threats and the estimated time it will take the storm to reach the rig location from the time it is first detected. The objective of this study is to use 50 years of cyclone history from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) database, the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) to estimate cyclone threats at any location in the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone threat is estimated based on the rig location as well as the start date and duration of the offshore activity. By threat, it is meant the likelihood that a specific location with an associated offshore activity lies within the forecasted track cone and storm size of the  upcoming cyclone. Three representative rig locations in the Gulf of Mexico were selected as assessment sites to evaluate the threat of incoming cyclones for different T-times. To conduct this tropical cyclone study, an Excel spreadsheet tool was developed to automate the analysis of the tropical cyclone data. The spreadsheet tool allows the user to input any location (i.e., longitude and latitude) in the Gulf of Mexico and  displays a list of historical cyclones that have passed within 150 nautical miles of that location during the activity period selected by the user. In addition, the tool allows the user to input any T-time to assess the threat of cyclones that would not provide adequate time to secure the well, evacuate, and/or move to a safe location."

The Effects of Different Density Estimates on the Ionized Gas Masses and Outflow Rates,"Active galactic nuclei (AGN) can launch outflows of ionized gas that may influence galaxy evolution, and quantifying their full impact requires spatially resolved measurements of the gas masses, velocities, and radial extents. We previously reported these quantities for the ionized narrow-line region outflows in six low-redshift AGN, where the gas velocities and extents were determined from Hubble Space Telescope long-slit spectroscopy. However, calculating the gas masses required multicomponent photoionization models to account for radial variations in the gas densities, which span ∼6 orders of magnitude. To simplify this method for larger samples with less spectral coverage, we compare these gas masses with those calculated from techniques in the literature. First, we use a recombination equation with three different estimates for the radial density profiles. These include constant densities, those derived from [S ii], and power-law profiles based on constant values of the ionization parameter (U). Second, we use single-component photoionization models with power-law density profiles based on constant U, and allow U to vary with radius based on the [O iii]/Hβ ratios. We find that assuming a constant density of nH = 10(^2) cm(^−3) overestimates the gas masses for all six outflows, particularly at small radii where the outflow rates peak. The use of [S ii] marginally matches the total gas masses, but also overestimates at small radii. Overall, single-component photoionization models where U varies with radius are able to best match the gas mass and outflow rate profiles when there are insufficient emission lines to construct detailed models."

We report the results of 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line observations of three fields in the star-forming region N105 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). N105 lies at the western edge of the LMC bar with on-going star formation traced by H2O, OH, and CH3OH masers, ultracompact Hii regions, and young stellar objects. Based on the spectral line modeling, we estimated rotational temperatures, column densities, and fractional molecular abundances for twelve 1.2 mm continuum sources. We
identified sources with a range of chemical make-ups, including two bona fide hot cores and four hot core candidates. The CH3OH emission is widespread and associated with all the continuum sources. COMs CH3CN and CH3OCH3 are detected toward two hot cores in N105 together with smaller molecules typically found in Galactic hot cores (e.g., SO2, SO, and HNCO) with the molecular abundances roughly scaling with metallicity. We report a tentative detection of the astrobiologically relevant formamide molecule (NH2CHO) toward one of the hot cores; if confirmed, this would be the first detection of NH2CHO in an extragalactic sub-solar metallicity environment. We suggest that metallicity inhomogeneities resulting from the tidal interactions between the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) might have led to the observed large variations in COM abundances in LMC hot cores."

Damage was inflicted on the cylinders in the form of impact and the resulting damage was assessed mainly by cross-sectional examination of the damage zone after impact. Due to financial restraints, no residual strength testing was performed in this study. The amount of fiber breakage was the response variable of interest since fiber breakage, rather than delaminations or other matrix damage, governs the burst strength of rocket motor cases. The results showed that the T1100 fiber may be slightly more damage resistant than the IM7 fiber."

the lunar environment. One concept of the future of lunar communication, LunaNet, outlines a complex network of networks.
Challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and reliability must first be addressed to successfully fulfill this vision. Machine
intelligence can greatly reduce the reliance on human operators and enable efficient operations for tasks such as scheduling and network management. Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other automated decision-making techniques can be used to allow network nodes to intelligently sense and adapt to changes in the environment such as link disruptions, new nodes joining the network, and support for a diverse range of protocols. Cognitive networking seeks to evolve these technologies into an autonomous system with improved science data return, reliability, and scalability. In this paper, we study four main areas as a means to further develop cognitive networking capabilities: networking protocol development, analysis of wireless data for modeling and simulation, development of algorithms for a multi-agent system, and spectrum sensing technology."

Atmospheric CO2, N2, O, and Ar densities are from NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) observations during the time period of 2015–2020 near solar minimum. These neutral measurements, together with contemporaneous solar irradiance measurements at Mars, enable disentanglement of the orbital effect (due to the annual Sun-Mars distance change with solar longitude) and the solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) effect in atmospheric density variations. The relative importance of these two effects, which is obtained using a statistical method of Dominance Analysis, reveals the competition between the indirect effect of solar infrared (via the upward coupling from the middle atmosphere) and the direct effect of solar EUV (due to local heating). Our results show that, unlike the orbital effect which is relatively constant at low altitudes and then decreases with increasing altitude, the solar EUV effect nearly monotonically increases. These two effects are comparable at high altitudes (about 240/270/205 km for CO2/N2/O). This analysis is extended to include long-term exospheric mass density estimates near 400 km from Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey data, with a focus on representative solar cycle phases of solar minimum and maximum. It is found that near 400 km, the orbital effect is always a key driver regardless of the solar cycle phase, while the solar EUV effect plays a minor role during solar minimum and is greatly enhanced and slightly exceeds the orbital effect during solar maximum."

While multiple satellite types provide data to monitor surface temperature, geostationary (GEO) sensors provide near-continuous, continental-scale observations which can better capture the diurnal variability of land surface temperature (LST) than intermittent observations from low-earth orbit (LEO) sensors. However, standard products from GEO satellites are available at coarsened spatial and temporal resolutions compared to the native sensor resolution. Using datasets from the NASA Earth Exchange, we leveraged co-located, co-temporal observations from LEO and GEO satellites to learn a data-driven mapping using a convolutional neural network. The resulting NASA Earth eXchange Artificial Intelligence LST (NEXAI-LST) achieved a mean absolute error of 1.73 K relative to the target LEO product and improves on both spatial and temporal resolution [2 km, 10 minute] compared to the GEO full disk standard product [10 km, hourly]. In validation against measurements from a ground-based sensor network, NEXAI-LST achieves similar or better fit than both LEO and GEO standard products, while depending none of the prior knowledge of land surface and atmospheric states required by physical-statistical models. Further, application of the model to unseen LEO and GEO satellites demonstrates robust generalization of the model across spatial region, time of day, and sensor. In support of NASA’s open-source science initiative, we make our NEXAI-LST product, model, and codes available to facilitate data exploration and further studies."

To envision rational design of small molecule drugs that target the diseased proteins it is important to quantify the structural effects of the mutations, as some of these mutants render the protein resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).  Herein we use advanced sampling techniques and long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations to predict the effect of major exon 20 mutations on the ErbB family, specifically EGFR and HER2 proteins.  Exon 20 mutations have been clinically known to induce TKI resistance, though the mechanisms of such an effect is poorly understood.  By mapping out the free energy landscape of the mutants and comparing them against the wild-type, we elucidate the structural differences in the binding pocket region that alter the nature of drug-protein interactions.  We believe that these insights will play a pivotal role in developing small molecule drugs that overcome the TKI resistance."

It is important to understand where landslides are likely to occur in the landscape to inform local analyses of exposure and potential impacts. Large triggering events such as earthquakes or major rain storms often cause hundreds or thousands of landslides, and mapping the landslide populations generated by these events can provide extensive datasets of landslide locations. Previous work has explored the characteristic locations of landslides triggered by seismic shaking, but rainfall induced landslides are likely to occur in different parts of a given landscape when compared to seismically induced failures. Here we show measurements of a range of topographic parameters associated with rainfall-induced landslides inventories, including a number of previously unpublished inventories which we also present here. We find that average upstream angle and compound topographic index are strong predictors of landslide scar location, while local relief and topographic position index provide a stronger sense of where landslide material may end up (and thus where hazard may be highest). By providing a large compilation of inventory data for open use by the landslide community, we suggest that this work could be useful for other regional and global landslide modelling studies and local calibration of landslide susceptibility assessment, as well as hazard mitigation studies."

It is also possible with such a system to retrieve sea surface salinity (SSS) which is important for understanding the impact of climate change on ocean circulation at high latitude. In contemporary sensors for retrieving SSS, such as SMOS and SMAP, sea surface temperature (SST), another parameter important for understanding ocean circulation and necessary in the retrieval of salinity, is treated as an ancillary parameter obtained from an independent source. However, both SSS and SST have peaks in sensitivity below 1 GHz; and it has been shown that measurements at multiple frequencies in this portion of the spectrum can take advantage of this peak in sensitivity to improve the accuracy of the retrieval of SSS. In this manuscript it will be shown that there is also the potential to retrieve SST and, in cold water, the possibility for  improved accuracy over existing retrievals."

Spectroscopic follow-up observations obtained with the HERMES spectrograph, combined with eclipse-timing variations (ETVs), confirm that the system is comprised of three OB stars, with a compact 1.10 d eclipsing binary and a non-eclipsing tertiary on a 52.04 d orbit. Dynamical modelling of the system (from radial velocity and ETVs) reveal a rare configuration wherein the tertiary star (O9.5-B0.5V; 14–17 M<sub>ꙩ</sub>) is more massive than the combined mass of the inner binary (10.9–13.2 M<sub>ꙩ</sub>). Given the high mass of the tertiary, we predict that this system will undergo multiple phases of mass transfer in the future, and likely end up as a double neutron star gravitational wave progenitor or an exotic Thorne–Żytkow object. Further observational characterization of this system promises constraints on both formation scenarios of massive stars as well as their exotic evolutionary end-products."

Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) measurements of Earth’s reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation provide a unique observational perspective that permits a more reliable model/data comparison than is possible with the otherwise available satellite data. The uniqueness is in the DSCOVR satellite’s viewing geometry, which enables continuous viewing of the Earth’s sunlit hemisphere from its Lissajous orbit around the Lagrangian L1 point. The key instrument is the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), which views the Earth’s sunlit hemisphere with 1024-by-1024-pixel imagery in 10 narrow spectral bands from 317 to 780 nm, acquiring up to 22 high spatial resolution images per day. The additional feature is that the frequency of EPIC image acquisition is nearly identical to that of the climate GCM data generation scheme where climate data for the entire globe are ‘instantaneously’ calculated at 1-h radiation time-step intervals. Implementation of the SHS (Sunlit Hemisphere Sampling) EPIC-view geometry for the in-line GCM output data sampling establishes a precise self-consistency in the space-time data sampling between EPIC observational and GCM output data generation and sampling. The remaining problem is that the GCM generated data are radiative fluxes, while the EPIC measurements are backscatter-dependent radiances. Radiance to flux conversion is a complex problem with no simple way to convert GCM radiative fluxes into spectral radiances. The more expedient approach is to convert the EPIC spectral radiances into broadband radiances by MODIS/CERES-based regression relationships and then into solar radiative fluxes using the CERES angular distribution models. Averaging over the sunlit hemisphere suppresses the meteorological weather noise, but preserves the intra-seasonal larger scale variability. Longitudinal slicing by the Earth’s rotation permits a self-consistent model/data comparison of the longitudinal model/data differences in the variability of the reflected solar radiation. Ancillary EPIC Composite data provide additional cloud property information for climate model diagnostics. Comparison of EPIC-derived seasonal and longitudinal variability of the Earth’s planetary albedo with the GISS ModelE2 results shows systematic overestimate of cloud reflectivity over the Pacific Ocean with corresponding underestimates over continental land areas."

We find that in 2019, global agri-food system emissions were 16.5 (95 %; CI range: 11–22) billion metric tonnes (GtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1)), corresponding to 31%(range: 19 %–43 %) of total anthropogenic emissions. Of the agri-food system total, global emissions within the farm gate – from crop and livestock production processes including on-farm energy use – were 7.2 GtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1); emissions from land use change, due to deforestation and peatland degradation, were 3.5 GtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1); and emissions from pre- and post-production processes – manufacturing of fertilizers, food processing, packaging, transport, retail, household consumption and food waste disposal – were 5.8 GtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1). Over the study period 1990–2019, agri-food system emissions increased in total by 17 %, largely driven by a doubling of emissions from pre- and post-production processes. Conversely, the FAOSTAT data show that since 1990 land use emissions decreased by 25 %, while emissions within the farm gate increased 9 %. In 2019, in terms of individual greenhouse gases (GHGs), pre- and postproduction processes emitted the most CO2 (3.9 GtCO2 yr(exp -1)), preceding land use change (3.3 GtCO2 yr(exp -1)) and farm gate (1.2 GtCO2 yr(exp -1)) emissions. Conversely, farm gate activities were by far the major emitter of methane (140 MtCH4 yr(exp -1)) and of nitrous oxide (7.8 MtN2Oyr(exp -1)). Pre- and post-production processes were also significant emitters of methane (49 MtCH4 yr(exp -1)), mostly generated from the decay of solid food waste in landfills and open dumps. One key trend over the 30-year period since 1990 highlighted by our analysis is the increasingly important role of food-related emissions generated outside of agricultural land, in pre- and post-production processes along the agri-food system, at global, regional and national scales. In fact, our data show that by 2019, pre- and post-production processes had overtaken farm gate processes to become the largest GHG component of agri-food system emissions in Annex I parties (2.2 GtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1)). They also more than doubled in non-Annex I parties (to 3.5 GtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1)), becoming larger than emissions from land use change. By 2019 food supply chains had become the largest agri-food system component in China (1100 MtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1)), the USA (700 MtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1)) and the EU-27 (600 MtCO2 eq. yr(exp -1)). This has important repercussions for food-relevant national mitigation strategies, considering that until recently these have focused mainly on reductions of non-CO2 gases within the farm gate and on CO2 mitigation from land use change.

Forests serve as crucial carbon sinks that combat the increasing effects of climate change while fuels reduction treatments may remove carbon from forested systems. As a result, forest managers need to find a balance between fire mitigation and carbon preservation. This project partnered with Boulder County Parks and Open Space (BCPOS) and the University of Colorado, Denver to investigate the 2020 Cal-Wood fire in Boulder County, Colorado. Using remote sensing data from Landsat 8 OLI, SRTM, Sentinel-2 MSI, and LiDAR, we mapped post-fire forest carbon pools and compared these values with values derived from measurements from plots on the ground. Results indicate that the correlations are R2=0.76 for aboveground live carbon, R2=0.44 for standing carbon, and R2=0.43 for aboveground dead carbon (R2=0.43), and R2=0.35 for total carbon (R2=0.35). Additionally, 38.5% of total carbon was stored in dead carbon and 14.4% was stored in live carbon. We next compared the post-fire pools between treated and untreated areas. Our analysis suggests fuels reduction treatments did not reduce carbon loss in the presence of wildfire enough to clearly distinguish the post-fire carbon in the treated and untreated areas. However, our final carbon maps still provide BCPOS and researchers with an opportunity to explore carbon estimation models based on remotely sensed data as well as a framework to evaluate fuels reduction treatment effectiveness and impact on forest carbon stocks for future wildfire events."

with Cr-25(wt.%)Si alloy were investigated. Microstructural observations revealed that the volume
fractions of open voids infiltrated by the molten metal varied between 3.7 and 10.0% irrespective of the magnitudes of the melt infiltration temperatures and hold times, which was attributed in part to substantial volatilization of the silicide charge based on computational thermodynamics. In the absence of experimental data, poor wettability of the melt could not be ruled out unambiguously. Other possible reasons are carefully examined and discarded. Ring microstructures were observed around the fibers mainly at the outer surfaces of the infiltrated preform, where the BN and chemical vapor infiltrated SiC coatings had vaporized in the high vacuum environment. In contrast, they were absent in the interior of the preform, where the coatings were still present with no evidence of molten metal attack of the coatings. Details of thermodynamic calculations are presented to confirm the volatilization of the BN and CVI SiC
coatings thereby resulting in the ring microstructures due to the filling of voids by the molten silicide. It is concluded that successful melt infiltration of Tyranno SA3® with Cr-25%Si can be only achieved under sufficient positive pressure to prevent volatilization of the coatings and the molten silicide."

In this paper, we propose and implement a framework for developing an aerosol model using their microphysical properties. Such microphysical properties as the size distribution, the complex refractive index, and the percentage of sphericity are derived from the global AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). These measurements, however, are typically retrieved when almucantar measurement procedures are performed (i.e., early mornings and late afternoons with clear sky) and might not have a temporal correspondence to a satellite overpass time, so a valid validation of satellite-derived products cannot be carried out. To address this problem of temporal inconsistency of satellite and ground-based measurements, we developed an approach to retrieve these microphysical properties (and the corresponding aerosol model) using the optical thickness at 440 nm, τ440, and the Ångström coefficient between 440 and 870 nm, α440–870. Such aerosol models were developed for 851 AERONET sites within the last 28 years. Obtained results suggest that empirically microphysical properties can be retrieved with uncertainties of up to 23 %. An exception is the imaginary part of the refractive index ni, for which the derived uncertainties reach up to 38 %. These specific parametric models of aerosol can be used for the studies when retrieval of microphysical properties is required as well as validation of satellite-derived products over land. Specifically, we demonstrate the usefulness of the aerosol models to validate surface reflectance records over land derived from optical remote sensing sensors. We then quantify the propagation of uncertainties in the surface reflectance due to uncertainties with the aerosol model retrieval that is used as a reference from radiative transfer simulations. Results indicate that individual aerosol microphysical properties can impact uncertainties in surface reflectance retrievals between 3.5 × 10(exp -5) to 1 × 10(exp -3) (in reflectance units). The overall impact of microphysical properties combined yields an overall uncertainty in surface reflectance <0.004 (in reflectance units). That corresponds, for example, to 1 to 3 % of the retrieved surface reflectance in the red spectral band (620–670 nm) by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. These uncertainty values are well below the specification (0.005 + 0.05ρ; ρ is the retrieved surface reflectance) used for the MODIS atmospheric correction."

The unusual properties of these organisms have received interest in multiple fields of biological research, and have found applications in biotechnology, especially in industrial processes. However, there are few listings of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms and their relevant environmental and physiological data. Such repositories can be used to standardize definitions of thermophile and hyperthermophile limits and tolerances and would mitigate the need for extracting organism data from diverse literature sources across multiple, sometimes loosely related, research fields. Therefore, we have developed ThermoBase, a web-based and freely available database which currently houses comprehensive descriptions for 1238 thermophilic or hyperthermophilic organisms. ThermoBase reports taxonomic, metabolic, environmental, experimental, and physiological information in addition to literature resources. This includes parameters such as coupling ions for chemiosmosis, optimal pH and range, optimal temperature and range, optimal pressure, and optimal salinity. The database interface allows for search features and sorting of parameters. As such, it is the goal of ThermoBase to facilitate and expedite hypothesis generation, literature research, and understanding relating to thermophiles and hyperthermophiles within the scientific community in an accessible and centralized repository. ThermoBase is freely available online at the Astrobiology Habitable Environments Database (AHED; https://ahed.nasa.gov), at the Database Center for Life Science (TogoDB; http://togodb.org/db/thermobase), and in the S1 File."

This paper investigates the safety impact with increasing mix of RPA amidst manned traffic in a generic arrival pattern with three merging flows. Latency was modelled as the response time between air traffic control's determination of a resolution and the RPAs' initiation of the maneuver. Reliability was modelled as a message drop probability. The experiment was repeated with two different aircraft types having different performance characteristics as representatives of RPA for conducting automated cargo operations. Overall response time above thirty seconds and message drop probability over twenty percent caused losses of separation. Specific results depended on the RPA aircraft type. The detailed impacts of latency and reliability with increasing mix of RPA traffic are provided. Applications of the approach for further studies at increasing levels of automation are also discussed."

Motivation was provided by experiments conducted in the Air Force Research Laboratory Mach 6 High Reynolds Number facility on a 7-degree half-angle cone with a roughness array located at 45 degrees from the apex on two nose tips of different blutness but equivalent roughness Reynolds number. Transition was only affected on the blunter cone, indicating that the transition onset is associated with the combined effects of bluntness and roughness. The present study investigates the 15.24 mm nose radius, 420 azimuthal wavenumber case via Navier-Stokes computations of the laminar base flow and instability analysis. Plane-marching parabolized stability equations (PSE) and inflow-resolvent analysis based on the three-dimensional, harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE) are used to calculate the amplification of disturbances along the roughness wake as well as over the roughness nearfield. Results show that the roughness shape can have a great impact on the characteristics of the most amplified wake instabilities. For the experimental configuration with cubic roughness elements of 15 <i>μ</i>m height, the flow is marginally unstable. For prismatic elements of 20 <i>μ</i>m height, the PSE predicts a logarithmic disturbance amplification ratio of <i>N</i> = 5.6 along its wake, but this ratio increases to <i>N</i> = 9.6 when the amplification over the roughness and separation regions is included in the inflow-resolvent analysis."

Established populations of L. dispar typically rest at low levels but undergo recurring outbreaks that cause tree mortality if they occur in quick succession or are combined with other stressors on tree health. Widespread defoliation events disrupt local wildlife, economies, and livelihoods. Accurate monitoring of defoliation events is necessary to implement effective land management practices that support tree health. There are challenges to accurately monitoring L. dispar outbreaks that include the ephemeral character of defoliation disturbances and the difficulties of conducting large-scale surveys of L. dispar populations using existing aerial and ground-based data collection methods. To better monitor the impact of L. dispar on forests in Vermont and New Hampshire, the NASA DEVELOP team partnered with organizations responsible for supporting land and invasive species management including the Forest Ecosystem Monitoring Cooperative, the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, the University of New Hampshire Cooperative Extension, and the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands, Forest Health Program. The team used NASA Earth observations collected by the Terra, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 satellites along with ancillary datasets to map historical tree defoliation from 2012 to 2021.

Land managers must consider short- and long-term goals for restoration as well as budgetary and personnel limitations after such disturbances. Satellite remote sensing can provide long-term and continuous vegetation monitoring to assess where restoration is needed most and where treatment practices are most likely to succeed. Harnessing Earth observation data, our team set out to observe trends in disturbances and the distribution of pinyon-juniper woodlands and sagebrush communities of National Park Service (NPS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands within the Grand Valley. We used imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, and Landsat sensors to map landcover change within these ecosystems from 1984-2021. Additionally, we analyzed disturbed areas and treatment sites to understand their effect on long-term vegetation health and recovery. Results showed that pinyon-juniper woodland has expanded in extent more than other landcover types, indicating woody encroachment into sagebrush ecosystems. We also found that wildfire disturbances had lasting impacts up to 20 years post-disturbance. Pre-fire treatment practices showed mixed results regarding their effectiveness at stopping fires and promoting post-fire recovery. These results will provide context to public land managers in the Grand Valley when developing management plans, ecological monitoring locations, and implementing treatment practices for future disturbances."

Previously, the NASA DEVELOP National Program partnered with organizations that focus on a variety of health and air quality concerns and is now committed to partnering directly with EJ organizations to address inequities in health and air quality through the application of Earth observations. To support the establishment of future partnerships, DEVELOP is working to identify potential partners for further EJ research in the U.S. regarding health and air quality. This project conducted a needs assessment with EJ organizations to quantify their EJ involvement, geospatial capacity, and interest in collaborating with DEVELOP. A broad literature review identified multiple factors influencing health and air quality for potential DEVELOP projects: agriculture, heat, wildfires, industry and transportation infrastructure, and miscellaneous factors (e.g., burning, urban heat island effect, smoke plumes, truck exhaust, and noise). The needs assessment showed that 22% of the organizations interviewed were primarily concerned with transportation infrastructure, 21% with industry, 19% with heat, 10% with miscellaneous factors (e.g., resource mining, COVID-19), 8% with wildfires, 7% with agriculture, and 6% with resource mining.

The flow configuration of primary interest corresponds to the cone-cylinder-flare model used in experimental measurements in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach-6 Quiet Tunnel at Purdue University.  For a flare angle of 10 degrees and a unit Reynolds number of 11.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>, their surface flow visualizations identified the presence of streamwise elongated thermal streaks near the reattachment position and the dominant azimuthal spacing between the streaks was determined to be approximately 10 degrees (i.e., an azimuthal mode number of 36). Previous linear stability analyses predicted that the amplification characteristics of small amplitude, unsteady, convective instabilities within this flow were consistent with the surface pressure fluctuations measured in the experiment. However, their accompanying analysis of global instabilities had found the separation bubble to be weakly unstable at the 10 degrees flare angle, with the most unstable global mode corresponding to a stationary disturbance with an azimuthal wavenumber of <i>m</i> ≈ 5, which was well below the measured wavenumber of <i>m</i> = 36. Besides confirming the presence of the global instability at these flow conditions, the present numerical simulations quantify the details of the stationary equilibrium state associated with the supercritical bifurcation resulting from the nonlinear saturation of the unstable global mode. Although velocity perturbations associated with the saturated global mode are dominated by the fundamental spanwise wavelength associated with the linear global instability, the surface heat flux downstream of reattachment is dominated by <i>m</i> = 36 in agreement with experimental measurements. However, the shorter wavelength peak (<i>m</i> = 36) in the azimuthal spectrum is not manifested as streaks with an azimuthal spacing of 10 degrees. An additional simulation of the combined evolution of both unsteady convective and global instabilities indicates that the nonlinear interactions between a broadband spectrum of oblique Mack’s first mode instabilities generate stationary vortex modes with a higher dominant wavenumber (<i>m</i> = 60) as that observed in the experiments.  Additional analyses are performed to predict the global mode behavior at other flare angles and how it differs from the convective centrifugal instability due to concave streamline curvature over the compression corner."

Priority needs were those that supported four key focus areas for NASA Aeronautics—Transonic Truss-Braced Wing, Electrified Aircraft Propulsion, Small-Core Turbine Engine, and High-Rate Composite Manufacturing—as well as other priority areas, such as Advanced Air Mobility, Certification by Analysis, and Commercial Supersonic Technology. Enduring needs were the additional long-term capabilities and expertise identified by the aviation community as being critical for NASA to provide. This study is called an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) because a large number of icing research needs were identified and analyzed to determine the highest priorities for NASA key focus areas and those that will endure into the future. This report offers a detailed description and results of the AoA study for icing research."

Under CSM, operators are responsible for maintaining separation. The CSM concept is enabled by sharing Operational Intent (OI) among the operators to ensure common situation awareness. The OI is represented as four-dimensional (time and space) information that indicates where an aircraft would be contained within the space and time, with a known level of confidence. However, each vehicle’s ability to stay within its region of OI may differ based on each vehicle’s performance characteristics, resulting in varying OI sizes among the vehicles. Such varying OI size could adversely affect efficient and fair access to the airspace. In this paper, an OI-generation algorithm under varying OI size restriction with Containment Confidence Level (CCL) is presented. High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) balloon operations are used as an example application. A framework is presented by which CCL information is used in the deconfliction process. A fast-time simulation experiment is conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework. The simulation results show a reduced number of unnecessary deconfliction actions."

Atmospheric modeling is critical for understanding the long-range transport of pollutants to the Arctic, as well as the abundance and distribution of SLCFs throughout the Arctic atmosphere. Modeling is also used as a tool to determine SLCF impacts on climate and health in the present and in future emissions scenarios. 

In this study, we evaluate 18 state-of-the-art atmospheric and Earth system models by assessing their representation of Arctic and Northern Hemisphere atmospheric SLCF distributions, considering a wide range of different chemical species (methane, tropospheric ozone and its precursors, black carbon, sulfate, organic aerosol, and particulate matter) and multiple observational datasets. Model simulations over 4 years (2008-2009 and 2014-2015) conducted for the 2022 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) SLCF assessment report are thoroughly evaluated against satellite, ground, ship, and aircraft-based observations. The annual means, seasonal cycles, and 3-D distributions of SLCFs were evaluated using several metrics, such as absolute and percent model biases and correlation coefficients. The results show a large range in model performance, with no one particular model or model type performing well for all regions and all SLCF species. The multi-model mean (mmm) was able to represent the general features of SLCFs in the Arctic and had the best overall performance. For the SLCFs with the greatest radiative impact (CH4, 03, BC, and SO(sup 2-)(sub 4)), the mmm was within ±25 % of the measurements across the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, we recommend a multi-model ensemble be used for simulating climate and health impacts of SLCFs. 

Of the SLCFs in our study, model biases were smallest for C""4 and greatest for OA. For most SLCFs, model biases skewed from positive to negative with increasing latitude. Our analysis suggests that vertical mixing, long-range transport, deposition, and wildfires remain highly uncertain processes. These processes need better representation within atmospheric models to improve their simulation of SLCFs in the Arctic environment. As model development proceeds in these areas, we highly recommend that the vertical and 3-D distribution of SLCFs be evaluated, as that information is critical to improving the uncertain processes in models."

However, this initially downstream movement slows down and ultimately reverses beyond a critical value of the nose radius, and may be related to external forcing in the form of freestream disturbances and/or surface roughness. To understand the effects of freestream acoustic disturbances on transition reversal over a blunt body, hypersonic boundary-layer receptivity to broadband freestream acoustic disturbances from the nozzle wall of a digital conventional wind tunnel is investigated by both direct numerical simulations (DNS) and modal and nonmodal stability analysis. A Mach 8 flow over a 7 deg half-angle cone with a nose radius of 𝑅<sub><i>𝑛</i></sub> = 5.2mm and freestream Reynolds number of 12.2 × 10<sup>6</sup>m<sup>-1</sup> is considered. The results show that the broadband tunnel noise in the free stream of a convectional hypersonic wind tunnel (i.e., outside of the nozzle-wall turbulent boundary layer) can be well represented by an acoustic model with an ansatz of slow acoustic waves. With successful calibration of the model parameters against the precursor tunnel DNS, such an acoustic ansatz can successfully reproduce both the frequency-wavenumber spectra and the temporal evolution of the broadband tunnel noise radiated from the nozzle wall. Additionally, the DNS of the Mach 8 blunt cone with tunnel-like acoustic input above the bow shock showed that the spectra of wall-pressure and heat-transfer fluctuations recovers the signature of the axisymmetric waves predicted by the nonmodal analysis. Furthermore, the azimuthal wavenumber and frequency spectrum of the temperature fluctuations as a function of the wall-normal distance show higher amplitudes for three-dimensional waves above the boundary-layer edge. The numerical schlieren contours show the inclined structures commonly observed in blunt cone experiments, demonstrating that they correspond to three-dimensional structures due to freestream disturbances in the presence of an entropy layer."

We focused on the region near Nobili crater, selected site for VIPER mission and stitched several images to create a high-resolution map of B01 crater, that included the visualization of PSRs. We have developed an in-built line of sight analysis tool in CMS, that analyzes the terrain profile and obstructions and provides the visibility of a given terrain for a remote observer. This tool was utilized to perform viewshed analysis to investigate the area inside the PSR B01, a remote observer such as a rover could see without actually crossing the region. This analysis was extended further to set different heights for various observers and then perform the viewshed analysis.

Regional trends in net top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), and a model similar to ERA5 with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice differ markedly, particularly over the Eastern Pacific Ocean, where CERES observes large positive trends. Hemispheric and global mean   net   TOA   flux   trends   for   the   two   reanalyses   are   smaller   than   CERES,   and   their climatological means are half those of CERES in the southern hemisphere (SH) and more than nine times larger in the northern hemisphere (NH). The regional trend pattern of the divergence of total atmospheric energy transport (TEDIV) over ocean determined using ERA5 analyzed fields is similar to that inferred from the difference between TOA and surface fluxes from ERA5 short-term forecasts. There is also agreement in the trend pattern over ocean for surface fluxes inferred as a residual between CERES net TOA flux and ERA5 analysis TEDIV and surface fluxes obtained directly from ERA5 forecasts. Robust trends are observed over the Gulf Stream associated with enhanced surface-to-atmosphere transfer of heat. Within the ocean, larger trends in ocean heating rate are found in the NH than the SH after 2005, but the magnitude of the trend varies greatly among datasets."

The latency can be substantial especially when satellite-based beyond-radio-line-of-sight communication and relay through the aircraft are employed. This study uses voice recordings of controller-pilot communications and aircraft track data to establish a baseline of pilot readback latencies and maneuver detection delays in the current piloted operations. A machine learning pipeline was developed to parse the contents of the air traffic control clearances including the callsigns using natural language processing. After manually validating the results obtained using the pipeline, the average pilot readback latency was found to be about 0.6 seconds. The average latency between the end of maneuver (inferred from track data), initiated by the pilot in response to the clearance, and the end of clearance was found to be about 176 seconds for altitude change commands, 69 seconds for heading change commands, and 182 seconds for speed change commands. The average latency between the beginning of maneuver and the end of clearance was found to be about 17 seconds for altitude change commands, 17seconds for heading change commands, and 25 seconds for speed change commands."

An armouring regime, specific to rubble-pile surfaces, has been proposed to occur when an impactor is comparable in diameter to a target surface particle (for example, a boulder). Armouring is proposed to reduce crater diameter, or prevent crater formation in the asteroid surface, at small crater diameters. Here, using measurements of 1,560 craters on the rubble-pile asteroid (101955) Bennu, we show that the boulder population controls a transition from crater formation to armouring at crater diameters ~2–3m, below which crater formation in the bulk surface is increasingly rare. By combining estimates of impactor flux with the armouring scaling relationship, we find that Bennu’s crater retention age (surface age derived from crater abundance) spans from 1.6–2.2Myr for craters less than a few meters to ~10–65Myr for craters >100m in diameter, reducing the maximum surface age by a factor of >15 relative to previous estimates. The range of crater retention ages, together with latitudinal variations in large-crater spatial density, indicate that ongoing resurfacing processes render the surface many times younger than the bulk asteroid."

The latter preserves depth perception without the disparity clutter from a stereo point cloud.  The interface is demonstrated on two real humanoids performing common explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) tasks such as door opening, vehicle inspection, and disruptor placement.

We choose a day of minimal solar activity, 2008-08-24, during the 2008 − 2009 minimum between cycles 23 and 24, and compute the brightness temperature (𝑇!) from that day’s solar spectral irradiance (𝑆𝑆𝐼!). We consider small variations of T and SSI about these reference values, and derive linear and quadratic analytic approximations by Taylor expansion about the reference day values. To determine approximation accuracy, we compare to exact brightness temperatures T computed from the Planck spectrum, by solving analytically for T, or equivalent root-finding in Wolfram Mathematica. We find that the linear analytic approximation overestimates, while the quadratic underestimates the exact result. This motivates search for statistical “fit” models “in between” the two analytic models, with minimum root-mean-square-error RMSE. We make this search using open-source statistical R software, determine coefficients for linear and quadratic fit models, and compare statistical with analytic RMSE’s. When only linear analytic and fit models are compared, the fit model is superior at ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared wavelengths. This again holds true when comparing only quadratic models. Quadratic is superior to linear for both analytic and statistical models, and statistical fits give smallest RMSE’s. Lastly, we use linear analytic and fit models to find an interpolating function in wavelength, useful in case the SIM results need adjustment to another choices of wavelengths, to compare or extend to any other instrument."

We found that the equatorward and westward propagating nighttime medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) occurred over Japan and Australia simultaneously following the tsunami oceanic waves reflected by the Emperor Seamount Chain in the northern hemisphere. The atmospheric gravity waves driven by reflected tsunami oceanic waves are hypothesized to be the source to trigger the conjugate MSTIDs by transporting the polarization electric fields along the field line to the conjugate hemisphere. Moreover, only the southwestward propagating MSTIDs have this conjugate
effect, which could be due to the wavefront orientation. The Perkins instability could also be involved in the interhemispheric coupling process. This study provides the first observational evidence that the reflected tsunami can induce conjugate ionospheric disturbances through electrodynamic forcing."

While these have been highly instructive in understanding many fundamental features of the various wave modes present, they neglect the complexities of geospace such as the inhomogeneities and curvilinear geometries present. Here, we show global MHD simulations of resonant waves impulsively excited by a solar wind pressure pulse. Although many aspects of the surface, fast magnetosonic (cavity/waveguide), and Alfvén modes present agree with the box and axially symmetric dipole models, we find some predictions for large-scale waves are significantly altered in a realistic magnetosphere. The radial ordering of fast mode turning points and Alfvén resonant locations may be reversed even with monotonic wave speeds. Additional nodes along field lines that are not present in the displacement/velocity occur in both the perpendicular and compressional components of the magnetic field. Close to the magnetopause, the perpendicular oscillations of the magnetic field have the opposite handedness to the velocity. Finally, widely used detection techniques for standing waves, both across and along the field, can fail to identify their presence. We explain how all these features arise from the MHD equations when accounting for a non-uniform background field and propose modified methods that might be applied to spacecraft observations."

The erupting ﬂux rope underwent kinking, rotation, and apparent leg–leg interaction during the event. The oscillations were observed simultaneously in multiple AIA channels at 304, 171, and 193 Å, indicating that multithermal plasma was entrained in the rope. After reaching the overlying loops in the active region, the ﬂux rope exhibited large-amplitude, decaying kink oscillations with an apparent initial amplitude of 30 Mm, period of about 16 min, and decay time of about 17 min. We interpret these oscillations as a fundamental standing kink mode of the ﬂux rope. The oscillation polarization has a clear vertical component, while the departure of the detected waveform from a sinusoidal signal suggests that the oscillation could be circularly or elliptically polarized. The estimated kink speed is 1080 km s−1, corresponding to an Alfv'en speed of about 760 km s−1. This speed, together with the estimated electron density in the rope from our DEM analysis, ne ≈ (1.5–2.0) ×109 cm−3, yields a magnetic ﬁeld strength of about 15 G. To the best of our knowledge, decaying kink oscillations of a ﬂux rope with non-horizontal polarization during a conﬁned eruptive ﬂare have not been reported before. These oscillations provide unique opportunities for indirect measurements of the magnetic-ﬁeld strength in low-coronal ﬂux ropes during failed eruptions."

Correlation studies that use these measurements as input may infer an incorrect correlation due to uncertainties arising from this spatial and temporal structure, especially at extreme and rare solar wind values. In particular, regression analysis will lead to a regression function whose slope is biased towards the mean value of the measurement parameter. This article demonstrates this regression bias by comparing simultaneous ACE and WIND solar wind measurements. A non-linear regression analysis between them leads to a perception of underestimation of extreme values of one measurement on average over the other. Using numerical experiments, we show that popular regression analysis techniques such as linear least-squares, orthogonal least-squares, and non-linear regression are not immune to this bias. Hence while using solar wind parameters as an independent variable in a correlation or regression analysis, random uncertainty in the independent variable can create unintended biases in the response of the dependent variable. More generally, the regression to the mean effect can impact both event-based, statistical studies of magnetospheric response to solar wind forcing."

This report was prepared by HydroGeoLogic, Inc. (HGL) for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under contract number 80KSC019F0096.

The annual groundwater sampling results demonstrated that the footprint where chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOC) are present above their State of Florida groundwater cleanup target levels (GCTLs) is not expanding overall. One non-chlorinated VOC (1,4-dioxane) is found above its GCTL at isolated points within the chlorinated VOC plume. The DPT groundwater investigation is being used to delineate the horizontal and vertical boundaries where chlorinated VOCs are present at levels above natural attenuation default concentrations. That data supports an evaluation of potential additional remedial actions.

The potential for VI into the CRHE Area Office (K6-1996H) is evaluated by collected sub-slab vapor samples from four locations twice a year (once in the wet season and once in the dry season).  The results for 2021 were all below the Environmental Protection Agency's vapor intrusion screening levels (VISLs) for both commercial and residential settings.

The path forward for the site is to continue annual monitoring for chlorinated VOCs and 1,4-dioxane until additional remedies are implemented or the site is transitioned to long-term monitoring."

The impact of the temperature dependence of immersion freezing on cloud feedbacks and AA is studied using NASA's GEOS-5 model. Parameterizations that exhibit low ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations in the high Arctic during summer are found to weaken the cloud-phase feedback. This allows sunlight to readily melt sea-ice in the summer, which decreases the stability of the lower troposphere, causing a decrease in wintertime cloud fraction over open ocean. Arctic amplification was found to span from ∼1.4 to >2.6, which spans 30% of the spread in AA in the coupled model intercomparison project models, depending on the temperature dependence of immersion freezing. These results suggest that summertime INP concentrations may provide an observational constraint on AA."

This study focuses on understanding and analyzing potential conflicts between UAM flights and conflicts between UAM and conventional aircraft. Fast-time simulations are conducted with a projected high-density of UAM traffic scenario and historical conventional non-UAM traffic flying under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) or Visual Flight Rules (VFR) in Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) airspace. The conflicts are analyzed by examining losses of separation and near mid-air collisions of UAM flights and unmitigated risk of collision. A set of varied separation standards are used to investigate the impact of the new UAM operations on safety. The preliminary conflict analysis results will help inform separation standards development and in airspace and route design activities for future UAM operations.

Earth  analogs  for  habitable  regions  on  ocean  worlds  include  interfaces  (e.g.,  ice-water  and  seafloor-water  boundaries),  hydrothermal  systems,  and  inside  of  ice, snow, clathrates, and crustal rocks. These analogs are best known in Earth’s ocean, but they may also exist on Earth’s land, particularly in polar regions. Importantly, ocean habitability  requires  that  parts  of  the  planetary  body  interact  dynamically  with  the  ocean.  Probing  the  habitability  of  currently  inaccessible  extraterrestrial  ocean  worlds  will  require  establishing  biogenicity  and  abiotic  reference  frames  for  organic  com-pounds on ocean worlds and technological advances to explore subsurface liquid water environments  beyond  Earth.

A component of this perturbation is due to the gravitational response of the body to the deformation of its surface induced by the atmospheric pressure loading. The magnitude of this effect depends on the relation between the loading and the response in terms of geopotential variations measured by the load Love numbers. In this work, we simulate and analyze the gravity field generated by the atmospheres of Venus and Mars by accounting for different models of their internal structure. By precisely characterizing the phenomena that drive the mass transportation in the atmosphere through general circulation models, we determine the effect of the interior structure on the response to the atmospheric loading. An accurate estimation of the time-varying gravity field, which measures the atmospheric contribution, may provide significant constraints on the interior structure through the measurement of the load Love numbers. A combined determination of tidal and load Love numbers would enhance our knowledge of the interior of planetary bodies, providing further geophysical constraints in the inversion of internal structure models.The gravity fields of celestial bodies that possess an atmosphere are periodically perturbed by the redistribution of fluid mass associated with the atmospheric dynamics.

JWST is a joint effort between NASA, ESA, and CSA and was launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) on an Ariane 5 rocket in December 2021. The three-month launch campaign utilized enhanced contamination controls to meet JWST’s strict cleanliness requirements. Prior to launch, JWST was permitted to only be exposed to ISO Class 7 cleanrooms, whereas the processing facilities at CSG are ISO Class 8.  NASA, ESA, Arianespace, and CNES implemented temporary upgrades to the nominal contamination control operations for the launch campaign unique to JWST, including the use of vetted, portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter walls, pre-entrance cleanliness acceptance surveys of each facility and the intra-plant transporter, tightened cleanroom protocols, upgraded garmenting and laundering techniques, cleaning of Self-Contained Atmospheric Protection Ensemble (SCAPE) suits, increased maintenance, staffed pre-cleaning stations, adaptation of the house purge network, and a contamination control enclosure atop the Ariane 5 launcher prior to fairing encapsulation. The Ariane 5 fairing interior and Vehicle Equipment Bay membrane also received multiple cleanings, detailed inspections, and verification sampling to achieve necessary cleanliness levels. The fairing itself was specially sealed to protect the inner environment with just a small, doored porthole accessible via diving board for final closeout of the purge interface. All these enhancements together allowed JWST to meet its contamination requirements for launch, ensuring successful post-separation deployments and mission science."

In this study, the retrieved ocean surface meteorological products – 2-m temperature, 2-m specific humidity, and 10-m wind speed were assimilated into a regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) framework to explore the application of these observations for two heavy snowfall events during the ICE-POP 2018: 27-28 February, and 7-8 March 2018. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the community Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) were used to conduct high resolution simulations and data assimilation experiments. The results indicate that the data assimilation has a large influence on surface thermodynamic and wind fields in the model initial condition for both events. With cycled data assimilation, significantly positive influence of the retrieved surface observation was found for the March case with improved quantitative precipitation forecast and reduced error in temperature forecast. A slightly smaller yet positive impact was also found in the forecast of the February case."

The vibration and acoustic tests occurred outside of cleanrooms. These areas are typically around ISO Class 8, far out of specifications for JWST. Through collaboration between the OTIS Mechanical and Contamination Engineering teams, a portable clean enclosure was designed, built, and verified to prevent contamination of the sensitive OTIS assembly. This manuscript describes the process of designing and building this enclosure, including materials selection and High Efficiency Particle Air (HEPA) filtration. This enclosure also provided environmental control with a portable air conditioning unit to control the relative humidity level enabling personnel to work within it. The manuscript emphasizes working in a systematic order to maintain cleanliness and integrity. “Clean as you go” during construction was a top priority to ensure that this critical Ground Support Equipment (GSE) was acceptable. The process of installing the walls and then sealing their internal and external surfaces with approved films was critical to maintaining OTIS integrity. This proved important because OTIS was in the enclosure for months longer than originally planned. This manuscript concludes by reviewing the process used to verify that the OTIS clean enclosure could achieve acceptable contamination level fallout accumulation for use during the vibration and acoustic testing and then verifying that the predicted performance was achieved after testing was complete."

Depending on characteristics at the atomic and molecular levels of the vehicle skin’s surface and the substances and particulates encountered, electrical charge will transfer between the vehicle and the encountered substances, resulting in an accumulation of electrical charge on the vehicle skin. If the vehicle skin is conductive and electrically bonded such that in its entirety it presents an equipotential surface, then the accumulated electrical charge will spread in a nearly uniform manner leaving all regions with a nearly equal potential with respect to each other and the surrounding environment. Regions that are not electrically bonded as described, or surfaces that have resistivity values, can reach different potentials than the surrounding surfaces. When this happens, the differing potentials may grow to very large magnitudes, leading to electrostatic discharge events between the regions. As the vehicle rises in altitude, the breakdown potential between these regions of differing potential decreases commensurate with decreases in atmospheric density and pressure. If the potential differences between surfaces of the vehicle become equal to or exceed the breakdown potential, one or more discharge events may occur, each of them generating voltage and current transients that can easily damage or interfere with the designed operation of on-board electrical, avionic, and communications and navigation systems. This lesson learned discusses an in-flight anomaly caused by triboelectric discharge events and exacerbated by the lack of adequate cable shielding that affected flight computer communication links. Also discussed are mitigations to prevent this occurrence."

Observations compiled over eight flights indicate predominantly far lesser CCN concentrations in the FT than in the MBL. For one flight, a fetch-dependent MBL-mean CCN budget is compiled from estimates of sea-surface fluxes, entrainment of FT air, and hydrometeor collision-coalescence, based on in-situ and remote-sensing measurements. Results indicate a dominant role of FT entrainment in reducing MBL CCN concentrations, consistent with satellite-observed trends in droplet number concentration upwind of CAO cloud-regime transitions over the northwest Atlantic. Relatively scant CCN may widely be associated with FT dry intrusions, and should accelerate cloud-regime transitions where underlying MBL air is CCN-rich, thereby reducing regional albedo."

In order to safely accommodate them, they should be fundamentally safe to fly. Unfortunately, current rigid designs could cause significant damage in case of a crash. To mitigate this problem, this report proposes constructing soft UAVs using tensegrity structures in order to mitigate the impact of collisions, effectively improving the safety of the vehicles and increasing public confidence in the use of UAVs. In this paradigm, the frame of the vehicle is designed using a tensegrity structure, a geometric structure composed of suspended elements of pure compression and pure tension, which during a collision can better absorb high stresses through elastic deformation. As a feasibility study we test this concept on an actuated tensegrity kite in a custom physics simulator, designed to simulate tensegrity structures with non-rigid rods, along with basic simulations of lift. Results show that this concept is feasible and that the kite can change orientation by actively changing the shape of the tensegrity structure."

Standards that are established and internationally recognized have been selected where possible to enable a variety of providers. Increasing hardware commonality among providers while decreasing unique configurations has the potential to reduce the traditional barriers in space exploration: overall mass and volume required to execute a mission. Standardizing interfaces reduces the scope of the development effort. The information within this document represents a set of parameters, which if accommodated in the system architecture support greater efficiencies, promote cost savings, and increase the probability of mission success.

The arrival of these aerosol layers in late June caused some concern within the London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) as according to dispersion simulations the volcanic plume from the 21 June 2019 eruption of Raikoke was not expected over the UK until early July. Using dispersion simulations from the Met Office Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion Modelling Environment (NAME), and supporting evidence from satellite and in situ aircraft observations, we show that the early arrival of the stratospheric layers was not due to aerosols from the explosive eruption of the Raikoke volcano but due to biomass burning smoke aerosols associated with intense forest fires in Alberta, Canada, that occurred 4 d prior to the Raikoke eruption. We use the observations and model simulations to describe the dispersion of both the volcanic and forest fire aerosol clouds and estimate that the initial Raikoke ash aerosol cloud contained around 15 Tg of volcanic ash and that the forest fires produced around 0.2 Tg of biomass burning aerosol. The operational monitoring of volcanic aerosol clouds is a vital capability in terms of aviation safety and the synergy of NAME dispersion simulations, and lidar data with depolarising capabilities allowed scientists at the Met Office to interpret the various aerosol layers over the UK and attribute the material to their sources. The use of NAME allowed the identification of the observed stratospheric layers that reached the UK on 27 June as biomass burning aerosol, characterised by a particle linear depolarisation ratio of 9 %, whereas with the lidar alone the latter could have been identified as the early arrival of a volcanic ash–sulfate mixed aerosol cloud. In the case under study, given the low concentration estimates, the exact identification of the aerosol layers would have made little substantive difference to the decision-making process within the London VAAC. However, our work shows how the use of dispersion modelling together with multiple observation sources enabled us to create a more complete description of atmospheric aerosol loading."

While the first proposal was for an asteroid, for a while some theories invoked a cometary impactor to explain perceived periodicities in mass extinctions. Such models have long been disfavored by the mass of Ir in the layer, inferred to be 2.0−2.8×10^(11)cu.g. The size of the Chicxulub crater leads to an estimated asteroid impactor diameter, D≈10km. Comets typically impact at higher speeds, reducing the impactor mass for the same impact energy. Although it is increasingly recognized that a continuum exists between comets and asteroids, ’comets’ are considered to be more ice-rich (estimates for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are about 20%;), implying lower Ir contents per impactor mass. A carbonaceous chondrite-like asteroid of the appropriate size would likely deliver ≈2.3×10^(11)g of Ir, in the center of the estimated mass range of the global Ir layer; but a comet would only deliver ∼0.1×10^(11)g, because it would be less massive. Although these conclusions are long standing, Siraj and Loeb have recently argued anew in favor of a comet over an asteroid, based on dynamical and geochemical evidence. Here we demonstrate that their arguments are based on misinterpretations of the literature, and that an asteroid is in fact still highly favored over a comet."

The variation of the potential with time in simulation agrees with previous experimental data, which suggests that the different radiation sources result in different amounts of potential modulation. The charge generation spatial profile strongly affects the potential modulation. The longitudinal range and starting location of generated charge most strongly impacts the amount of potential modulation, while the radial width has a slight effect, and the temporal duration of charge injection has negligible impact on potential modulation"

In this study, the gravitational effect is included in the thermodynamic modeling so that not only the deposition point can be located, but also the vertical pressure and density profiles below the deposition point can be determined along with the corresponding compositional profiles in the equilibrium phases.

However, topographic correction is not routinely implemented in standard data pre-processing chains (e.g., Landsat Analysis Ready Data), and there is a lack of consensus whether topographic correction is necessary, and if so, how to conduct it. Furthermore, methods that correct simultaneously for atmospheric and topographic effects are becoming available, but they have not been compared directly. Our objects were to investigate (1) the effectiveness of two topographic correction approaches that integrate atmospheric and topographic correction, (2) improvements in classification accuracy when analyzing topographically corrected single-date imagery (14 July 2016 and 2 October 2016), versus a full Landsat time series from 2014 to 2016, and 3) improvements in classification accuracy when including additional terrain information (i.e., topographic slope, elevation, and aspect). We developed a physical based model and compared it with an enhanced C-correction, both of which integrate atmospheric and topographic correction. We compared classification accuracies with and without topographic correction using combinations of single-date imagery, image composites and spectral-temporal metrics generated from the full Landsat time series, and additional terrain information in the Caucasus Mountains. We found that both the enhanced C-correction and the physical model performed very well and largely eliminated the correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r ranges from 0.06 to 0.24) between surface reflectance and illumination condition, but the physical model performed best (r ranges from 0.05 to 0.11). Both image composites, and spectral-temporal metrics generated from corrected imagery, resulted in significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher classification accuracies and better forest classifications, especially for the mixed forests. Adding terrain information reduced classification error significantly, but not as much as topographic correction. In summary, topographic correction remains necessary, even when analyzing a full Landsat time series and including a digital elevation model in the classification. We recommend that topographic correction should be applied when analyzing Landsat satellite imagery in mountainous region for forest cover classification."

Despite efforts in estimating irrigation water withdrawals in earth system models, uncertainties and discrepancies exist within and across modeling systems conditioned by model structure, irrigation parameterization, and the choice of input datasets. Achieving model reliability could be much more challenging for data-sparse regions, given limited access to ground truth for parameterization and validation. Here, we demonstrate the potential of utilizing remotely sensed vegetation and soil moisture observations in constraining irrigation estimation in the Noah-MP land surface model. Results indicate that the two constraints together can effectively reduce model sensitivity to the choice of irrigation parameterization by 7%–43%. It also improves the characterization of the spatial patterns of irrigation and its impact on evapotranspiration and surface soil moisture by correcting for vegetation conditions and irrigation timing. This study highlights the importance of utilizing remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation measurements in detecting irrigation signals and correcting for vegetation growth. Integrating the two remote sensing datasets into the model provides an effective and less feature engineered approach to constraining the uncertainty of irrigation modeling. Such strategies can be potentially transferred to other modeling systems and applied to regions across the globe."

Certain simulations reproduced absolute δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> values across all time periods, along with LGM and MH δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>p</sub> anomalies relative to the PI, better than the default parameterization.

durations while subjected to the detonative events. 4-5 co-rotating detonations were observed
during most tests with a single test showing 2-3 waves. Several other milestones were also
achieved including successful demonstration of active throttling with detonation modes,
successful ignition without a predetonator, and the use of novel additive manufacturing

We demonstrate that the spatial-temporal variation of grid-mean in-cloud <PoP> can be largely explained by the variation of the joint probability density function of LWP and CDNC in the phase space specified by the bivariate PoP (LWP and CDNC) function. Through a series of sensitivity tests guided by this understanding, we find that in the Southeastern Pacific and Atlantic the stratocumulus to cumulus transition of the <PoP> is mainly due to the variation of CDNC while the annual cycle is mainly due to the variation of LWP.

I also identified and modeled preliminary use case scenarios for aerial assets in the demonstrator and, building on previously produced preliminary high-level models of the 8 SD-1 Services, Functions, and Capabilities (SFCs) and their IASMS data flows, worked to model the Real-Time Risk Assessment (RTRA) tool as an implementation of Risk Assessment and Management that can take in multiple sets of data monitored by SFCs. 

Project deliverables include stakeholder requirements tables and matrices and systems model diagrams produced with MagicDraw software in the SysML Systems Modeling Language, with eventual plans to connect model diagrams to a Department of Defense Operational Viewpoint (OV-1) graphic, a high-level operational concept graphic that will be used to visualize the SD-1 scenarioin a future phase. 

The system model serves to provide a common understanding of the scope of and activities necessary for the completion of SD-1,and traces how stakeholder needs are to be addressed."

An IRCS uses the same fuel and oxidizer as the main propulsion system, allowing for increased performance and simplified cryogenic fluid management operations. The IRCS team at Marshall Spaceflight Center is currently evaluating an IRCS system that uses a combination of electric pumps and pressure-regulation devices to provide a constant flow of conditioned propellant to a thruster bank during operation. In contrast to accumulator and gasifier designs, the recirculation loop design is less massive and can provide large, sustained flowrates to the thruster inlet.

In the summer 2021 test series presented herein, the feasibility of this concept was evaluated using liquid nitrogen as a simulant for liquid oxygen. The goals of this test series were to demonstrate the ability of the pump and pressure regulator to maintain adequate thruster inlet conditions during transient operation, and to demonstrate the ability for the system to operate in an “idle mode” that maintains system chill between activations. During test operations, the back-pressure regulator responded more slowly than the opening/closing of valves in the thruster simulant, but it was still able to attenuate the pressure fluctuation at the pump discharge and ensure a stable flowrate through the pump. Similarly, the pump was able to be run far below its nominal operating point and successfully flow sufficient fluid to maintain chill conditions."

modeling language for F Prime. F Prime is an open-source
flight software framework developed at JPL and deployed,
among other places, on the Mars helicopter Ingenuity. FPP
provides a convenient way to model the architectural elements
of an F Prime application, e.g., components, ports, and their
connections. It has a succinct and readable syntax, a well-
defined semantics, and robust error checking and reporting. The
FPP tool suite, written in Scala, analyzes FPP models, reports
errors, and translates correct FPP models to a combination
of XML and C++. Existing F Prime tools translate the XML
to a partial implementation in C++, to be completed by the
developers. The model elements have clean interfaces and are
highly reusable. An accompanying visualization tool constructs
diagrams of components and connections that FSW developers
can use to understand and communicate their designs, for ex-
ample at reviews. We discuss the design and implementation of
FPP and the integration of FPP into F Prime. We also discuss
our experience using FPP to construct F Prime models. Finally,
we discuss our plans for future work, including improved code

On 11-March 2022 a ridging pattern formed in the jet stream near Enderby Land, Antarctica and progressed eastward. The ridge deepened markedly into a classic omega-shaped blocking pattern (Fig. 1), extending into the plateau by 14-March. The blocking pattern is remarkable for the circulation strength – which forced warm air and moisture into the high interior of the continent, its poleward extent, and its persistence. Here, we use GMAO FP, MERRA-2 analyses, conventional observations, and AIRS/Aqua L3 data to characterize the event. We wish to examine, (1) How unusual was the event relative to available analysis records, (2) What were the effects of the event on surface mass balance (SMB)? and (3) Is there a relation to general circulation trends that led to this event?"

Our Solar system harbours a very diverse population of planetary bodies, including those composed of rock, ice, gas, or a mixture of all. While a rich arsenal of geophysical methods has been developed over several years to infer knowledge about the interior of the Earth, the inventory of tools to investigate the interiors of other Solar-system bodies remains limited. With seismic data only available for the Earth, the Moon, and Mars, geodetic measurements, including the observation of the tidal response, have become especially valuable and therefore, has played an important role in understanding the interior and history of several Solar system bodies. To use tidal response measurements as a means to obtain constraints on the interior structure of planetary bodies, appropriate understanding of the viscoelastic reaction of the materials from which the planets are formed is needed. Here, we review the fundamental aspects of the tidal modeling and the information on the present-day interior properties and evolution of several planets and moons based on studying their tidal response. We begin with an outline of the theory of viscoelasticity and tidal response. Next, we proceed by discussing the information on the tidal response and the inferred structure of Mercury, Venus, Mars and its moons, the Moon, and the largest satellites of giant planets, obtained from the analysis of the data that has been provided by space missions. We also summarise the upcoming possibilities offered by the currently planned missions."

These ejecta create risks to surface assets that have yet to be fully assessed. To better understand these risks, plume surface interactions can be simulated on the ground by firing a test engine plume into a bin of lunar regolith simulant under vacuum conditions. The dynamics of the resultant ejecta can then be recorded. In this technical memorandum we discuss the processes used in preparing a 150 kg bin of lunar regolith simulant for plume surface interaction ground tests under vacuum conditions for the NASA STMD Plume Surface Interaction project. We present our approach to mitigating regolith simulant eruptions during pump-down, the methods used to fill and reset the regolith simulant bin for each test, and the techniques used to characterize the consistency of regolith simulant geotechnical properties before each new firing. The challenges of preparing a regolith simulant test bin below an ambient pressure of one atmosphere, particularly on the large scale, could largely be overcome with a system that could fill the test bin with simulant inside the chamber and under vacuum conditions."

The object was to identify their advantages and challenges as well as to influence the technology developments with flight-type requirements.  This was easily done by using the promising Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) solar- powered rover mission as a platform to ‘swap in’ a DRPS. The ‘pickup truck bed’ approach allowed both simplified installation and operation of the DRPS while keeping the forward lunar surface ‘blocked’ from the DRPS waste heat which could sublimate the icy surface.  It was found that with the Stirling DRPS option the mass is within the planned VIPER lander capability and is very close to VIPER mass and size (the DRPS replaces large battery pack/solar arrays).  The Stirling DRPS option produced ~300 Watts electrical (We) using six general purpose heat source (GPHS) bricks and eight Stirling convertors. Replacing the solar/battery power with radioisotope power allows a continuous presence (instead of 6 hours) in a permanently shadowed region (PSR) and over 18 months of operations with minimal science impact (rearward surface heating).  It was also found that use of a dynamic system (instead of a thermoelectric system) reduces the heat impact on the science environment two-to-three times. The DRPS, along with a relay link (like Gateway), can provide continuous access to PSRs.  The system was also found to be capable of roving for 8 hours per day with a range of over 500 km in 18 months.  Preliminary cost estimates fit into a Class D mission but only assuming VIPER heritage and launch, lander, operations, nuclear specific costs [National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), fueling, transport, Launch Services Program (LSP), etc.] and DRPS are not included."

The second VIIRS sensor aboard the first Join Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1) satellite has been in operation for 4 years since its launch on 18 November 2017, which became NOAA-20. Well-geolocated and radiometrically calibrated Level-1 sensor data records (SDRs) from VIIRS are crucial to numerical weather prediction (NWP) and Level-2+ environmental data record (EDR) algorithms and products. The high quality of Level-2+ EDRs is a requirement for the continuity of NASA Earth science data records (ESDRs) and climate data records (CDRs), one of the two objectives of the SNPP mission and one of the three elements in the JPSS mission objective. The other objective of the SNPP mission is risk reduction for the follow-on JPSS missions. This paper summarizes the on-orbit geolocation calibration and validation (Cal/Val) activities for both VIIRS sensors onboard SNPP and NOAA-20 in the past 10 years. These activities include nominal geolocation Cal/Val activities, risk reduction activities, and improvements for the on-orbit VIIRS sensor operations. After these activities, sub-pixel geolocation accuracy is achieved. Nadir equivalent geolocation uncertainty is generally within 75 m (1-σ), or 20% imagery band pixels, in either the along-scan or along-track direction for both SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS sensors. The worst 16-day measured geolocation errors (radial, 3-σ) are 280 m and 267 m, respectively, in the latest SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS data collections, which are better than the required accuracy of 375 m (radial, 3-σ). The risk reduction activities also improved VIIRS builds for JPSS-3 and JPSS-4 satellites, and provide lessons learned for other VIIRS-like sensor builds."

Previous analyses of NASA sonic boom community noise survey data utilized a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression model, which did not account for dose uncertainty. The current work extends the model to account for either classical or Berkson dose uncertainty. The extended model is applied to two simulated dose-response datasets to illustrate conditions under which the dose uncertainty term does and does not correct for the artificial flattening introduced by dose uncertainty. Finally, the extended model is applied to two previous NASA sonic boom community noise surveys. The resulting dose-response curve slope for the average participant is 5 to 10% steeper, but the difference in the noise dose that elicits a 5% highly annoyed response is small (less than 1 dB). The difference remains insignificant when producing population summary dose-response curves. Commentary is included on applicability to future X-59 low-boom community noise survey data modeling and analysis."

In this study, we report on mesoscale concentric gravity waves observed in the mesopause airglow layer following the La Soufriere volcano eruption in April 2021. A large ash plume observed by the spaceborne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer instrument on April 10 reached ∼20 km. Temporal evolution of the volcanic ash plume was provided by the GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager. Nightglow gravity waves were observed by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day Night Band. These waves had horizontal wavelengths of ∼25–40 km, and took about a half-to-1 hr to travel from the tropopause to the mesopause. Some concentric ionospheric disturbance signatures are also seen in Global Navigation Satellite System-total electron content maps. We found the launch of gravity waves to be highly correlated with the elevated ash plume from explosive eruptions."

from the solar interior, atmosphere, and the interplanetary (IP) medium. MOST will be a 4-
spacecraft mission with one each at L4 (MOST1) and L5 (MOST2) and the other two (MOST3

systematically probe the magnetic content of transient IP structures including coronal mass

Sun Chaser’s remote sensing is essential for ~90% of current physics-based and empirical solar energetic particle (SEP) event forecasting techniques. Without Sun Chaser, there cannot be a basis for SEP event all-clear forecasting. It establishes and maintains a space weather (SWx) radiation safe zone that supports all near-term human missions to the Moon and Mars. Sun Chaser latitude in-situ coverage also provides a unique opportunity for solar wind-, interplanetary- and interstellar-dust science. In combination with existing and planned observatories at L1 and L5, the three locations provide 240° longitude coverage of resolving photospheric magnetic field structure and safe Earth-directed CME viewing. A ~14°-inclination of both L4 and L5 out of the ecliptic guarantees continuous viewing of both solar poles and continuous in-situ presence on both sides of the heliographic equator, with >3.6° elevation. Extended observations in both longitude and latitude will revolutionize global solar wind modeling and immediate validation, and enables the development of local helioseismology, with potential for long-term solar activity forecasting."

The impacts derived from climate models are poorly constrained by observations, because retrieving robust large-scale signals of aerosol-cloud interactions are frequently hampered by the considerable noise associated with meteorological co-variability. The Iceland-Holuhraun effusive eruption in 2014 resulted in a massive aerosol plume in an otherwise near-pristine environment and thus provided an ideal natural experiment to quantify cloud responses to aerosol perturbations. Here we disentangle significant signals from the noise of meteorological co-variability using a satellite-based machine-learning approach. Our analysis shows that aerosols from the eruption increased cloud cover by approximately 10%, and this appears to be the leading cause of climate forcing, rather than cloud brightening as previously thought. We find that volcanic aerosols do brighten clouds by reducing droplet size, but this has a significantly smaller radiative impact than changes in cloud fraction. These results add substantial observational constraints on the cooling impact of aerosols. Such constraints are critical for improving climate models, which still inadequately represent the complex macro-physical and micro-physical impacts of aerosol-cloud interactions."

While VITA-65 defines backplane and board-level profiles from COTS vendors to ensure interoperability of products used in developing systems and subsystems, the VITA-78 standard defines SpaceVPX to incorporate fault tolerance features that are required by many spaceflight systems. However, VITA-78 allows so much flexibility that interoperability between modules cannot be assured. This assessment provides guidelines on the use of, and extensions to, the VITA-78 standard to enable avionics interoperability for future NASA missions.

The assessment team was comprised of subject matter experts (SMEs) from Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Johnson Space Center (JSC), and Langley Research Center (LaRC). The team included valuable external consulting support from a SME who was a key participant in the development of the VITA-78 standard. The team had extensive collaboration with the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) High Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) project, specifically in the development of SpaceVPX interconnect findings, observations, and NESC recommendations. To provide an understanding of the breadth of implementations that SpaceVPX must accommodate, multiple NASA use cases were analyzed to assess the requirements for SpaceVPX implementations across a wide range of NASA missions (Appendix C). Applications included crewed missions, science missions, and orbital and surface robotic systems. Product surveys were conducted to assess the level of industry support for SpaceVPX, applications, and the variations in their implementations (Appendix D).

In-depth analysis was conducted in the areas of: (a) power management and distribution, (b) form factors and daughtercards, (c) interconnect, and (d) fault tolerance. Leveraging the use cases, product surveys, and SMEs from multiple NASA Centers, these areas were analyzed to determine the range of implementations permitted by the VITA-78 standard and potential interoperability issues. Applicable findings and NESC recommendations were provided for each area.

During this assessment, there were multiple opportunities to engage with other agencies to learn about their interest in SpaceVPX, their strategies for implementing SpaceVPX-based systems, and their internal development efforts. These engagements also generated findings and NESC recommendations.

Based on this assessment analysis, NESC recommendations were made regarding the feature set and module profiles to support NASA SpaceVPX implementations. This feature set includes restrictions on features in VITA-78, and extensions to the standard. Key recommendations in this area include the use of 10 Gigabit Ethernet and Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) as high bandwidth interconnect on the backplane, the retention of SpaceWire interconnect for control functions, and support for 3U (unit) and 6U, form factors for NASA systems. Restrictions were proposed on the usage of user-defined signals to promote interoperability, and
specific power managements and distribution schemes for 3U systems. Beyond the technical implementation of SpaceVPX, recommendations were made on areas that warrant further investigation. Primary among these is the recommendation for NASA to collaborate with other space-going agencies and industry to incorporate recommendations into a future ‘dot spec’ of VITA-78. This would ensure wide adoption and availability of the modules that comply with the specification. The assessment includes appendices with candidate module profiles that can be considered as a starting point for this activity, and example systems based on the recommendations.

Follow-on studies are recommended for architectures beyond SpaceVPX to address potential enhancements including condensed set of interconnect, software required to implement protocol layers on the interconnect (and other features), alternative power  architectures, and system-level testability."

Although it was developed to a high state of readiness in previous years (it went through a CATE analysis and was declared “doable now”), the NSF has not had the funding mechanisms in place to fund this mid-scale program. Now it does, and the community must seize this opportunity to modernize the FASR design and build the instrument in this decade. The concept and its science potential have been abundantly proven by the pathfinding Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA), which has demonstrated a small subset of FASR’s key capabilities such as dynamically measuring the evolving magnetic field in eruptive flares, the temporal and spatial evolution of the electron energy distribution in flares, and the extensive coupling among dynamic components (flare, flux rope, current sheet). The FASR concept, which is orders of magnitude more powerful than EOVSA, is low-risk and extremely high reward, exploiting a fundamentally new research domain in solar and space weather physics. Utilizing dynamic broadband imaging spectropolarimetry at radio wavelengths, with its unique sensitivity to coronal magnetic fields and to both thermal plasma and nonthermal electrons from large flares to extremely weak transients, the ground-based FASR will make synoptic measurements of the coronal magnetic field and map emissions from the chromosphere to the middle corona in 3D. With its high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, as well as its superior imaging fidelity and dynamic range, FASR is poised to provide a system-wide perspective on myriad coupled phenomena. FASR will be a highly complementary and synergistic component of solar and heliospheric observing capabilities that is critically needed to support the next generation of solar science."

The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing changes in emissions provide a natural experiment to test whether NO2 reductions have been starker in regions of Europe with larger diesel passenger vehicle shares. Here we use a semi-empirical approach that combines in-situ NO2 observations from urban areas and an atmospheric composition model within a machine learning algorithm to estimate business-as-usual NO2 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These estimates account for the moderating influences of meteorology, chemistry, and traffic. Comparing the observed NO2 concentrations against business-as-usual estimates indicates that diesel passenger vehicle shares played a major role in the magnitude of NO2 reductions. European cities with the five largest shares of diesel passenger vehicles experienced NO2 reductions ∼ 2.5 times larger than cities with the five smallest diesel shares. Extending our methods to a cohort of non-European cities reveals that NO2 reductions in these cities were generally smaller than reductions in European cities, which was expected given their small diesel shares. We identify potential factors such as the deterioration of engine controls associated with older diesel vehicles to explain spread in the relationship between cities’ shares of diesel vehicles and changes in NO2 during the pandemic. Our results provide a glimpse of potential
NO2 reductions that could accompany future deliberate efforts to phase out or remove passenger vehicles from cities."

We use XGBoostclassification trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to explore the errors inthe prediction of lightning occurrence in the NASA GEOS model, a widely used Earth SystemModel.

The assessment of the ECC homogenization benefit has been carried out using comparisons with other ozone measuring ground based instruments at the same station (lidar, surface measurements) and with collocated satellite observations of the O3vertical profile by Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). The major differences between uncorrected and5homogenized ECC data are related to a change of ozonesonde type in 1997, removal of the pressure dependency of the ECC background current and correction of internal pump temperature. The original 3-4 ppbv positive bias between ECC and Lidar in the troposphere is corrected with the homogenization. The ECC 30-years trends of the seasonally adjusted ozone concentrations are also significantly improved in both the troposphere and the stratosphere after the ECC homogenization, as shown by the ECC/lidar or ECC/surface ozone trend comparisons. A -0.19% per year negative trend of the normalization factor (NT)10calculated using independent measurements of the total ozone column (TOC) at OHP disappears after homogenization of the ECC data. There is however a remaining -3.7% negative bias in the TOC which is likely related to an underestimate of the ECC concentrations in the stratosphere above 50 hPa. Differences between TOC measured by homogenized ECC and satellite observations show a smaller bias of -1%. Comparisons between homogenized ECC and OHP stratospheric lidar and MLS observations below 26 km are slightly negative (-2%) or positive (+2%), respectively. Both the comparisons with lidar and15satellite observations suggest that homogenization increases the negative bias of the ECC to values lower than -6% above 28km. The reason for this bias is still unclear, but a possible explanation might be related to freezing or evaporation of the sonde solution in the stratosphere."

Our DEVELOP team partnered with the National Park Service (NPS) in Colorado National Monument and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)in McInnis Canyons and Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation Areas to investigate disturbances to land cover. NPS partners were interested in identifying areas at risk of pinyon-juniper die-off or encroachment by invasive species. The BLM partners prioritized identifying areas suitable for fire reduction/prevention treatment. To address these concerns, we forecasted landcover change in the Grand Valley region of Colorado using NASA Earth observation data from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Terra and Aqua. We collected and analyzed these data in conjunction with Term I of this project. We found that the primary drivers of forecasted landcover change in the study area were aspect and elevation. Our forecasted landcover change maps, created using the Idrisi TerrSet Land Change Modeler, addressed the needs of our partners by showing potential habitat suitability trends, which will inform management planning. Forecasted landcover maps indicated that by 2040, ecosystems within partner management areas will likely see tree encroachment on shrublands."

Multiple spaceflight stressors can elicit adverse health outcomes including exposure to space radiation. Space radiation exposure has been identified by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as an important contributor to cancer, degenerative tissue diseases including cataracts, cardiovascular disease, immune system dysfunction and possible central nervous system decrements. The complexity of the human central nervous system makes it difficult to adequately recapitulate in experimental model systems, which hinders quantitative description of associated decrements. The brain aging hallmarks, as introduced by Mattson and Arumugam in 2018, are measurable cellular and molecular hallmarks that generally contribute to the aging process, describe an aging phenotype, and are part of the etiology of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. These hallmarks include mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of oxidatively damaged molecules (oxidative stress), impaired lysosome and proteasome function, dysregulation of neuronal calcium homeostasis, compromised adaptive cellular stress response, aberrant neuronal network activity, impaired deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair, inflammation, impaired neurogenesis and dysregulated energy metabolism. Cellular senescence and telomere attrition may also be considered, though more evidence is needed to regard them as brain-specific hallmarks of aging. Radiation exposure has previously been correlated with aging etiology; therefore, investigating the effects of radiation exposure within the context of the hallmarks of brain aging may provide insights into potential health risks facing NASA astronauts, and may provide a means to identify disease processes that may be important targets for disease prevention or intervention. This work describes the hallmarks of brain aging and serves as a primer for future investigation into how the hallmarks of brain aging may compare and contrast with outcomes associated with exposure to the space radiation environment. Further, it will be useful in future identification of hallmarks that may be appropriate to target for radiation countermeasures specific to the central nervous system."

While some microgravity mass gauging technologies exist at various TRLs, most of them have major disadvantages. Improvements in microgravity propellant mass gauging will result in improvements to many areas of propellant management, which influences performance and mission assurance. Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) is a sensing technology that has been used in the oil/gas industry for decades to measure multi-phase flow rate in pipes. ECT, when installed in a tank, is able to reconstruct the liquid distribution inside of the tank, which can then be integrated to obtain mass. ECT mass gauging recently achieved high accuracy in laboratory testing on the ground, and while ECT mass gauging will theoretically work during all phases of flight, it had not yet been tested in microgravity. The NASA KSC Launch Services Program, with support from the Flight Opportunities Program, successfully flew an ECT tank liquid mass gauging system experiment on a Zero-G parabolic flight aircraft. The experiment hardware was rented from a company; NASA LSP did no technology development work for this project. This STRIVES entry is for the entire raw data set, which consists of approximately 25GB of csv files of capacitance and motion data from the ground and flight tests of the experiment.

Locust research has typically focused on predicting the paths and breeding grounds based on ground surveys and remote sensing of outbreak factors. In this study, we hypothesized that it is possible to detect desert locust cropland damage through the analysis of fine-scale (5–10 m) resolution satellite remote sensing datasets. We performed our analysis on 121 swarm point locations on croplands derived from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, and 94 ‘non-affected’ random cropland sample points generated for this study that are distributed within 20–25 km from the ‘center’ of swarm affected sample locations. Integrated Drought Condition Indices (IDCIs) and Vegetation Health Indices (VHIs) calculated for the affected sample locations for 2000–2020 were strongly correlated (R(exp 2) > 0.90) with that of the corresponding non-affected group of sample sites. Drought indices were strongly correlated with the evaluation Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Indices (SPEIs) and showed that 2020 was the wettest year since 2000. In 2020, the NDVI and backscatter coefficient of cropland phenologies from the affected versus non-affected cropland sample sites showed a slightly wider, but significant gap in March (short growing season) and August-October (long growing season). Thus, slightly wider gaps in cropland phenologies between the affected and non-affected sites were likely induced from the locust damage, not drought, with fine scale data representing a larger gap."

A number of mechanisms that might plausibly contribute to its operation have been proposed, but the relative role played
by each remains unclear. This uncertainty stems from continuing questions concerning the speed and structure of deep-seated convective flows. Those flows are in-turn thought to sustain both the Sun’s turbulent EMF and the large-scale flows of differential rotation and meridional circulation suspected of influencing the dynamo’s organization and timing.

Ultimately, the convective and large-scale flow structure derive from the Coriolis force. When the Coriolis effect is weak (rapid convective flow), convection exhibits little organization in its spatial structure, and the meridional flow is expected to assume a single-celled profile within each hemisphere. Convection subject to strong Coriolis forces instead organizes into compact, spiraling columnar structures and sustains meridional flows that possess multiple cells in latitude and radius. The implications for the dynamo in these two regimes are substantial, impacting the flux-transport properties of any assumed meridional flow and the convectively-driven EMF.

Continued progress in this area is complicated by (i) inconsistencies between helioseismic measurements of convective and meridional flow made with different techniques and instruments, and (ii) a lack of high-latitude data for convection, differential rotation, and meridional flow. We suggest that the path forward to resolving these difficulties is twofold. First, the acquisition of long-term helioseismic and emissivity measurements obtained from a polar vantage point is vital to complete our picture of the Sun’s outer convection zone. Second, sustained and expanded investment in theory-oriented and combined theory/observational research initiatives will be crucial to fully exploit these new observations and to resolve inconsistencies between existing measurements."

With an unparalleled combination of large field of view and high magnetic sensitivity, the 1.5m COSMO Large Coronagraph (LC) opens a new window on coronal magnetism on global scales. Along with K-Coronagraph (K-Cor) middle-corona observations and the Chromosphere and Prominence Magnetometer (ChroMag) observations of the photosphere and chromosphere, these capabilities enable researchers to finally answer crucial questions about solar eruptions, coronal heating/solar wind acceleration, and the solar dynamo.
 - COSMO is mature. K-Cor has been operating at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO) since 2013 and ChroMag is soon to be deployed. Also at MLSO, the 20cm Upgraded Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (UCoMP) is proving the power of global coronal spectropolarimetry and whetting the community’s appetite for the unprecedented sensitivity of the LC.
 - COSMO is low risk. A recent development: the NSF-funded COSMO Site and Design Advancement (COSADA) is a three-year effort currently underway that reduces risk through site selection and final design of the LC.
 - COSMO has broad community support. The fact that COSMO fills a critical gap in our observational capabilities was recognized in the last Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey. COSMO builds on the legacy and thriving user base of the MLSO, which has provided global synoptic solar observations to the community for over sixty years.

Globally, numerous efforts have been made to anticipate potential droughts, crop conditions, and food shortages to foster improved food insecurity early warning and risk management. To support this goal, we develop an Earth Observation (EO) and machine-learning-based operational, subnational maize yield forecast system and evaluate its out-of-sample forecast skills during the growing seasons for Kenya, Somalia, Malawi, and Burkina Faso. In general, forecast skills improve substantially during the vegetative growth period (VP) and gradually during the reproductive development period (RP). Thus, mid-season assessment can provide effective early warning months before harvest. Skillful forecasts (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) < 20%)

The mass determination of CMEs can be subject to significant uncertainty. To minimize this problem, we have used extensive statistical analysis. For this purpose, we employed data included in the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) catalog. We estimated the contributions to mass loss from the Sun from different subsamples of CMEs (selected on the basis of their masses, angular widths, and position angles). The temporal variations of the YTMLR were compared to those of the sunspot number (SSN), X-ray flare flux, and the Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index. We show that the CME mass included in the CDAW catalog reflects with high accuracy the actual mass-loss rate from the Sun through CMEs. Additionally, it is shown that the CME mass distribution in the log-lin representation reflects the Gaussian distribution very well. This means that the CMEs included in the CDAW catalog form one coherent population of ejections that have been correctly identified. Unlike the CME occurrence rate, it turns out that the YTMLR is a very good indicator of solar activity (e.g., SSN) and space weather (e.g., Dst index) consequences. These results are very important, since the YTMLR, unlike the mass loss through solar wind, significantly depends on solar cycles."

We analyze the kinematics in the radial and lateral directions and identify three stages in the early evolution of the CME: (1) a hyper-inflation stage, when the CME laterally expands at speeds of ∼1000 km/s, followed by (2) a shorter and slower expansion stage of a few minutes and ending with (3) a self-similar phase that carries the CME into the middle corona. The first two stages coincide with the impulsive phase of the accompanying flare, the formation and separation of an EUV wave from the CME, and the start of the metric type II radio burst. Our 3D analysis suggests that the hyper-inflation phase may be a crucial stage in the CME formation with wide-ranging implications for solar eruption research. It likely represents the formation stage of the magnetic structure that is eventually ejected into the corona, as the white-light CME. It appears to be driven by the injection of poloidal flux into the ejecting magnetic structure, which leads to the lateral (primarily) growth of the magnetic flux rope. The rapid growth results in the creation of EUV waves and eventually shocks at the CME flanks that are detected as metric type II radio bursts. In other words, the hyper-inflation stage in the early CME evolution may be the ""missing"" link between CMEs, flares, and coronal shocks."

As a follow-up study of Huang et al. (2021), we quantify the impact of satellite soil moisture (SM) on model representations of this process when different dry-deposition parameterizations are implemented, based on which the implications for interpreting O3 air pollution levels and assessing the O3 impacts on human and ecosystem health are provided. The SM data from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission are assimilated into the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model within the NASA Land Information System framework, semicoupled with Weather Research and Forecasting model with online Chemistry (WRF-Chem) regional-scale simulations covering the southeastern US. Major changes in the modeling system used include enabling the dynamic vegetation option, adding the irrigation process, and updating the scheme for the surface exchange coefficient. Two dry-deposition schemes are implemented, i.e., the Wesely scheme and a “dynamic” scheme, in the latter of which dry-deposition parameterization is coupled with photosynthesis and vegetation dynamics. It is demonstrated that, when the dynamic scheme is applied, the simulated O3 dry-deposition velocities vd and their stomatal and cuticular portions, as well as the total O3 fluxes Ft, are larger overall; vd and Ft are 2–3 times more sensitive to the SM changes due to the data assimilation (DA). Further, through case studies at two forested sites with different soil types and hydrological regimes, we highlight that, applying the Community Land Model type of SM factor controlling stomatal resistance (i.e., β factor) scheme in replacement of the Noah-type β factor scheme reduced the v(d) sensitivity to SM changes by ∼75 % at one site, while it doubled this sensitivity at the other site. Referring to multiple evaluation datasets, which may be associated with variable extents of uncertainty, the model performance of vegetation, surface fluxes, weather, and surface O3 concentrations shows mixed responses to the DA, some of which display land cover dependency. Finally, using model-derived concentration- and flux-based policy-relevant O3 metrics as well as their matching exposure–response functions, the relative biomass/crop yield losses for several types of vegetation/crops are estimated to be within a wide range of 1 %–17 %. Their sensitivities to the model's dry-deposition scheme and the implementation of SM DA are discussed."

Through the implementation of aerosol-typing algorithms, vertical layers of aerosols are assigned a type, such as marine, dust, and smoke, and a corresponding extinction-to-backscatter (lidar) ratio. With updates to the previous aerosol-typing algorithms, we find that CATS, even as a technology demonstration, observed the documented seasonal cycle of aerosols, comparing favorably with the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) space-based lidar and the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) model reanalysis.

However, current levels of cyanobacteria and phosphorus created breeding grounds for harmful algal blooms (HABs). The excess of phosphorus runoff into Lake Champlain over the past decade encouraged toxic cyanobacterial formations, thereby increasing the severity of HABs towards local economy and ecology. In partnership with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Northeast Region, this project utilized Earth observations to identify risk factors associated with toxic algal blooms. The team detected historic algal bloom trends with Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 9 OLI-2. The team also used Sentinel-3 OLCI and the German Aerospace Center’s Earth Sensing Imagery Spectrometer (DESIS) to visualize algal bloom patterns and Landsat 8 OLI, Landsat 9 OLI-2, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) to identify phosphorus sources within the watershed. The team’s analyses indicated an increase in cyanobacteria blooms during summer months from 2016-2022, with Missisquoi and St. Albans Bay exhibiting the greatest concentrations of toxic events. Furthermore, 16% of the watershed was identified as posing an immediate threat to the lake’s hydrology. The area of greatest concern was the Missisquoi Bay sub-watershed, with 229,044 acres of land prone to excessive phosphorus runoff. Providing this information to the NRCS Northeast Region enabled the organization to quantify risk factors associated with algal blooms and modify mitigation efforts to better target future bloom events."

Gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation in global urban areas is one of important metrics for assessing the impacts of urbanization on terrestrial ecosystems. To date, very limited data and information on the spatial-temporal dynamics of GPP in the global urban areas are available. In this study, we reported the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of annual GPP during 2000–2016 from 8,182 gridcells (0.5° by 0.5° latitude and longitude) that have various proportion of urban areas. Approximately 79.3% of these urban gridcells had increasing trends of annual GPP during 2000-2016. As urban area proportion (%) within individual urban gridcells increased, the means of annual GPP trends also increased. Our results suggested that for those urban gridcells, the negative effect of urban expansion (often measured by impervious surfaces) on GPP was to large degree compensated by increased vegetation within the gridcells, mostly driven by urban management and local climate and environment. Our findings on the continued increases of annual GPP in most of urban gridcells shed new insight on the importance of urban areas on terrestrial carbon cycle and the potential of urban management and local climate and environment on improving vegetation in urban areas."

Long-range scattered light comes from the entire solar disk, while short-range scattered light is considered to come from a region within 50” of the region of interest. The formulae were derived from the Fe XII 195.12 Å emission line observed by EIS and the AIA 193 Å channel. A study of the weaker Fe XIV 274.20 Å line during the transit and a comparison of scattering in the AIA 193 Å and 304 Å channels suggests the EIS scattering formula applies to other emission lines in the EIS wavebands. Both formulae should be valid in regions of fairly uniform emission such as coronal holes and quiet Sun, but may be less accurate for faint areas close (around 100”) to bright active regions. The formula for EIS is used to estimate the scattered light component of Fe XII λ195.12 for seven on-disk coronal holes observed between 2010 and 2018. Scattered light contributions of 56%–100% are found, suggesting that these features are dominated by scattered light, consistent with earlier work of Wendeln & Landi. Emission lines from the S X and Si X ions—formed at the same temperature as Fe XII and often used to derive the first ionization potential bias from EIS data—are also expected to be dominated by scattered light in coronal holes."

Using the 2D improved Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Heliosphere (iPATH) model, we investigate the origin of this longitudinal trend. We consider multiple cases with different solar wind speeds and eruption speeds of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and fit the longitudinal distributions of time-averaged fluence by symmetric/asymmetric Gaussian functions with three time intervals of 8, 24 and 48 hr after the flare onset time respectively. The simulation results are compared with a statistical study of three-spacecraft events. We suggest that the East-West asymmetry of SEP fluence and peak intensity can be primarily caused the combined effect of an extended shock acceleration process and the evolution of magnetic field connection to the shock front. Our simulations show that the solar wind speed and the CME speed are important factors determining the East-West fluence asymmetry."

Comparison of assimilated and model-only soil moisture estimates with publicly available in situ measurements highlights the relative improvement in soil moisture estimates by assimilating SMAP retrievals. Across the Tibetan Plateau, DA-NoCDF reduced the mean bias and RMSE by 8.4 % and 9.4 %, even though assimilation only occurred during less than 10 % of the study period due to frozen (or partially frozen) soil conditions. The best goodness-of-fit statistics were achieved for the IMERG DA-NoCDF soil moisture experiment. The general lack of publicly available in situ measurements across irrigated areas limited a domain-wide direct model validation. However, comparison with regional irrigation patterns suggested correction of biases associated with an unmodeled hydrologic phenomenon (i.e., anthropogenic influence via irrigation) as a result of SMAP soil moisture retrieval assimilation. The greatest sensitivity to assimilation was observed in cropland areas. Improvements in soil moisture potentially translate into improved spatiotemporal patterns of modeled evapotranspiration, although limited influence from soil moisture assimilation was observed on modeled processes within the carbon cycle such as gross primary production. Improvement in fine-scale modeled estimates by assimilating coarse-scale retrievals highlights the potential of this approach for soil moisture estimation over data-scarce regions."

These include low-altitude airspace operations with small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs), short distance urban and intercity operations, and high- altitude Upper Class E operations. These and other new operations are expected to result in a much higher operational tempo than is currently experienced across the National Airspace System (NAS). The projected increase in operations, as well as the introduction of new aircraft form factors and supporting technologies—including increasing autonomy—will present challenges to the existing Air Traffic Management (ATM) system, which is currently unable to cost-effectively scale and deliver needed services. In response to these challenges and opportunities, a highly automated, cooperative environment incorporating a federated network has been envisioned and described through multiple operational concepts, depicting the future operating environment as part of the NAS. Foundational to the success of this future operating environment is the establishment of common business rules and understandings across relevant stakeholders, referred to as Community Based Rules (CBRs). Development, adoption, and implementation of CBRs will require collaboration across multiple stakeholders, including operators, support services (industry), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to identify and resolve a broad range of questions and challenges. Examples of these questions include “what rules are needed?”, “how are they expressed?”, and “how will they be managed?” This document identifies and describes an initial set of questions and considerations to be examined as efforts begin to create the innovative, automated, cooperative operating environment of the future. The goal is to establish a common frame of reference to support discussions and decisions regarding the future implementation of CBRs as part of the NAS."

Operation for Urban Air Mobility, or UAM. UAM is a concept for the transportation of people and goods in the metropolitan
environment using small, efficient aircraft over short distances as part of an expanding multimodal transportation network. UAM
will leverage emerging technologies including electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, increasing levels of
automation and a new operational paradigm in dense airspace where a set of agreed-upon rules govern the procedures and
interactions defining a cooperative environment in which operators are entrusted with a range of functions typically conducted by
Air Traffic Control (ATC). These rules, proposed in the FAA NextGen Office’s UAM Concept of Operations [1], were originally
termed Community Based Rules or Community Business Rules (CBRs), and will in the future termed Cooperative Operating
Practices (COPs); this document uses the original term, CBR.

CBRs are a set of rules, developed by the UAM community and (where necessary) approved by the FAA that govern the
interactions between UAM entities and limit the need for ATC services including, but not limited to, separation control by ATC,
addressing a fundamental challenge to scaling UAM operations. UAM community development of CBRs is anticipated to
accelerate the adoption of new practices while retaining the regulatory authority of the FAA within required domains (e.g., NAS
safety, security and equal access). However, there currently exists no agreed industry forum or defined procedures for CBR
development. Investigation of best practices for the development of UAM CBRs was identified by NASA and the FAA NextGen
Office as a research need.

In collaboration with seven industry partners, NASA participated in a series of simulations that investigated elements of the
envisioned UAM operations, with a primary focus on Strategic Conflict Management (SCM). The development and conduct of
cooperative UAM simulations with seven industry partners provided a unique opportunity to investigate CBR development
practices. Development of CBRs for the UAM SCM simulations was conducted in parallel with simulation capability
development and was closely related to requirements definition for the simulations. As such, the CBR development effort
presented herein had two objectives: explore CBR development practices in collaboration with the industry partners and develop
an initial set of UAM CBRs to support simulation requirements definition and development.

Consensus was achieved among NASA and the industry partners on 24 CBRs that were developed to support the cooperative
simulation operations across five topic areas: General (related to test requirements), Operational Intent, Conformance Monitoring,
Demand Capacity Balancing, and Airspace Constraint Management. Additional topic areas and CBRs were discussed but were
deemed outside the scope of the simulation; these are included in the appendices.

A collaborative, iterative process was employed for developing the CBRs engaging both NASA and Industry; because CBR
development is envisioned to be community-driven, opportunities were sought that provided industry partners leadership roles in
developing CBRs. The following key observations and recommendations may aid the UAM industry in future CBR development
efforts:

- The lack of a defined process proved challenging initially. Stakeholder engagement in the early stages of CBR development was intermittent and may have been due to the lack of a clear definition of roles and responsibilities of those involved in the effort.
- Industry leadership of CBR topic areas proved successful. Discussions in these topic areas were engaging, with alternate viewpoints freely discussed and detailed CBRs resulting. This points to the importance of identifying the best-suited leadership in technical areas for CBR development.
- Discussions within a CBR topic area were typically dominated by only a few participants. Whereas all industry partners contributed to CBR development, within each topic area, technical leadership was evident even when not formally established. This observation may indicate that smaller, focused groups may be more effective in initial CBR development than an open forum or large standards development effort (although both maybe required prior to FAA review and approval for some CBRs).
- Identifying suitable forums for initial UAM CBR development and identifying the most effective industry participants and leadership will be crucial for successful CBR development. Although the operational need for UAM CBRs may not be immediate, establishing the forums and leadership to define the processes for CBR development is a prudent early step to UAM realization."

In this work we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of nutrient limitation on bacterial growth and biofilm formation under microgravity in support of biofilm mitigation efforts in exploration water recovery systems. A representative species of bacteria that is commonly cultured from the ISS WPA was cultured in an WPA influent water ersatz formulation tailored for microbiology studies. Burkholderia contaminans was cultured under a simulated microgravity (SµG) treatment in a vertically rotating high-aspect rotating vessel (HARV), with a rotating control (R) in the horizontal plane at the determined optimal rpm of 15 along with a stationary (S) control. At different time points, the bacterial culture and ersatz were harvested for bacterial counts, transcriptomic and nutrient content analyses. Under the test conditions, the culture under SµG treatment consumed the essential nutrients faster than the R and S control cultures in the early stage of growth, thus approaching a nutrient limited growth condition earlier than the controls.  The rapid uptake and subsequent depletion of essential nutrients was further illustrated in the transcriptomic response of the SµG culture when compared to the transcriptomic response of the R and S control conditions. The observed starvation response may serve as one element to explain a moderate enhancement of biofilm formation in the SµG treatment. One implication of this investigation is that biofilm mitigation in the ISS environment could be supported by ensuring a steady flow of water as a vehicle for essential nutrients within the WPA to avoid complete consumption which occurs in times of no flow lending to undesired biofilm formation."

Wave activities with frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency are observed, and these are whistler waves propagating almost anti-parallel to the magnetic field. The waves are concentrated near the magnetospheric separatrix away from the X line, but the wave activity also spreads through the EDR near the X line. The reconnection outflows are asymmetric in the outflow direction in the magnetospheric side, and the wave intensity is stronger in the side of the faster electron outflow. We study the whistler waves using the fast Fourier transform, analyses of electron velocity distribution functions, and the dispersion solver calculation. Along the magnetospheric separatrix in the stronger outflow side, highly anisotropic electron beams exist with super-Alfvénic drift speeds. The dispersion analysis shows that there are two modes: a temperature anisotropy mode and a beam mode. Outside the EDR, the whistler wave intensity is highest near the separatrix, but the wave intensity decreases if we move away from the separatrix toward the magnetic neutral line because of the increase in the electron population near zero parallel velocity. In the EDR, in the velocity plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, ring/crescent electron distribution functions are observed. Near the X-line, the wave power is enhanced where nongyrotropic electrons contribute to increase the perpendicular temperature anisotropy."

In geospace, charge exchange occurs in the Earth’s topside ionosphere, polar wind, plasmasphere, inner magnetosphere, and magnetosheath. Past and current space missions have profiled plasma and electromagnetic characteristics in various parts of the Earth’s magnetospheric system. However, observations of the exosphere, i.e., neutrals above 500 km altitude, are still sparse and, in some regions, non-existent, which limits our understanding of the neutral contribution to the overall dynamics of the geospace environment.
Cold exospheric neutrals (< 10 eV) play an important role in the Sun-Earth interaction. Variability of exospheric density provides key information of the Earth’s atmospheric loss under dynamic space environment conditions. Various neutral species and their density variations in the polar wind can alter ion outflow patterns, modifying global magnetospheric dynamics. Exospheric neutrals also provide an energy sink for the inner magnetosphere by creating Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENAs) through charge exchange with high-energy ring current ions, which subsequently leave our geospace system unimpeded by magnetic fields. Exospheric neutrals also provide a means to observe the global interaction of the solar wind – magnetosphere, through global imaging of the system via ENAs (e.g., the TWINS and IMAGE missions) and soft X-rays (e.g., the upcoming LEXI and SMILE missions), the byproducts of neutral-plasma charge exchange.
In the coming decade, we advocate that our community needs to increase our exploration of the neutral populations in the outermost reaches of the Earth’s atmosphere. It is imperative that we improve both in-situ and remote-sensing technologies for measuring key neutral species in our exosphere. We also encourage dedicated exosphere missions and to stimulate model developments of our exosphere and its interaction with the co-located magnetospheric system and neighboring Ionosphere - Thermosphere - Mesosphere system."

Information regarding flood effects on food security is of particular importance for humanitarian organizations and is especially valuable across Africa's rural areas that contribute to regional food supplies. We quantitatively evaluate where and to what extent flooding impacts food security across Africa, using a Granger causality analysis and panel modeling approaches. Within our modeled areas, we find that ∼12% of the people that experienced food insecurity from 2009 to 2020 had their food security status affected by flooding. Furthermore, flooding and its associated meteorological conditions can simultaneously degrade food security locally while enhancing it at regional spatial scales, leading to large variations in overall food security outcomes. Dedicated data collection at the intersection of flood events and associated food security measures across different spatial and temporal scales are required to better characterize the extent of flood impact and inform preparedness, response, and recovery needs."

Data were collected at 4.5 μm with the Spitzer Space Telescope, 2–8 keV with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 3–70 keV with NuSTAR, 340 GHz with ALMA, and 2.2 μm with the GRAVITY instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Two dates show moderate variability with no significant lags between the submillimeter and the infrared at 99% confidence. A moderately bright NIR flare (FK ∼ 15 mJy) was captured on July 18 simultaneous with an X-ray flare (F2−10 keV ∼ 0.1 counts s−1 ) that most likely preceded bright submillimeter flux (F340 GHz ∼ 5.5 Jy) by about + - + 34 33 14 minutes at 99% confidence. The uncertainty in this lag is dominated by the fact that we did not observe the peak of the submillimeter emission. A synchrotron source cooled through adiabatic expansion can describe a rise in the submillimeter once the synchrotron self-Compton NIR and X-ray peaks have faded. This model predicts high GHz and THz fluxes at the time of the NIR/X-ray peak and electron densities well above those implied from average accretion rates for Sgr A* . However, the higher electron density postulated in this scenario would be in agreement with the idea that 2019 was an extraordinary epoch with a heightened accretion rate. Since the NIR and X-ray peaks can also be fit by a nonthermal synchrotron source with lower electron densities, we cannot rule out an unrelated chance coincidence of this bright submillimeter flare with the NIR/X-ray emission."

First is the possibility of it being printable, which would allow for printing the energy storage device along with the circuit instead of having to find a way to add one later without damaging the rest of the components. When not printed in a specific design for use on a printed wiring board, this type of ultracapacitor could still be cured via a mold to a shape suitable to specific applications. Many polymers maintain some flexibility even after curing, such as the silicone used in this study. The manufacturing process would also be far simpler than that of conventional ultracapacitors.In this work, solid-state ultracapacitors were made by adding the dielectric powder to a two-part polymer (resin and hardener) at the same time. The mixture was then cured in the desired shape at a low temperature until completely set. The addition of the powder to the polymer increased its dielectric properties while leaving most of its physical properties unaltered. At higher powder loading percentages, there were some physical changes as the maximum loading point was approached. To determine the efficiency of these solid-state ultracapacitors, their capacitances were tested, and their dielectric constants (DCs) were measured and compared."

In 2016 NASA sponsored a 2040 Vision study (which appeared in 2018) to define the potential 25-year future state required for integrated multiscale modeling of materials and systems (e.g., load-bearing structures) to accelerate the pace and reduce the expense of innovation in future aerospace and aeronautical systems.  The study envisions a cyber-physical-social ecosystem comprised of experimentally verified and validated (V & V) computational models, tools, and techniques, along with the associated digital tapestry, that impacts the entire supply chain to enable cost-effective, rapid, and revolutionary design of “fit-for-purpose” materials, components, and systems. 

Consequently, the development of a robust information management system that incorporates (across the full life cycle) both experimental (real data) and virtual data resulting from the application of various simulation tools (at single or multiple length scales), therefore enabling the virtual design and optimization of materials throughout their processing – internal structure – property – performance envelope, has become critical. This need is also fueled by the demands for higher efficiency in material testing; consistency, quality, and traceability of data; product design; engineering analysis; as well as control of access to proprietary or sensitive information.  This is particularly true when attempting to merge ICME practices with recent additive manufacturing technology which will enable production of the resulting 2040 Vision material and structural designs.  At NASA Glenn Research Center we are exploring the future of material science through the use of novel characterization methodologies, high performance computing, and recently an emphasis on integrated computational materials engineering (ICME). Herein, recent efforts to incorporate an Application Table within NASA Glenn Research Center’s ICME Granta MI database is presented. The goal is to provide a place where material and structural application information/requirements can be linked so as to marry the “design the-material” and the “design-with-material” paradigms and thereby enable application-driven design and optimization of materials and structures by providing a central location that links material processing at various length scales to the application’s performance requirements. This paper discusses the specifics of this Application Table as well as best practices and key principles for the development of a robust materials information management system to enable the 2040 Vision integrated materials and structures ecosystem. Furthermore, it presents the intended role of the Application Table in the future of ICME design of “fit-for-purpose” materials, showing the need for a well-established framework that can successfully bridge the gap between the design “the material” and design “with-the-material” paradigms."

To better understand the connections between soil moisture and vegetation health, stakeholders are interested in using soil moisture data in the development of fire-related indices. NASA DEVELOP partnered with the Desert Research Institute’s Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC), NOAA’s National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS), the North Carolina State Climate Office, and Oklahoma State University to evaluate how measures of remotely-sensed standardized soil moisture compare to vegetation health and fire fuel indices in a case study of two fire events: the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 Fire near Gatlinburg, Tennessee and the 2021 Bootleg Fire near Beatty, Oregon. The team visualized vegetation change six months prior to each event using spectral vegetation indices observed by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard NASA’s Terra satellite and the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI). These visualizations were compared to soil moisture data from European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture (CCI SM) project, collected in part by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite. Overall, period of record percentiles and fraction of available water standardizations correlated more strongly with fuel load and vegetation indices, indicating their utility for fire potential monitoring. Soil moisture conditions remained exceptionally dry for several months before the Chimney Tops 2 Fire whereas drought conditions only intensified immediately prior to the Bootleg Fire. This indicates greater sensitivity to drought conditions under Western fire regimes.

The technical approach was to conduct a mass transfer and bacterial culture study under both simulated µg and ambient gravity. The aim was to correlate nutrient consumption to gene expression to better understand biofilm formation. 

A representative species of bacteria that is commonly cultured from the International Space Station (ISS) Water Processor Assembly (WPA) was cultured in a WPA influent water ersatz formulation that is tailored for microbiology studies. A mass transfer rate study was carried out using the ersatz WPA influent water by introducing a water-soluble dye to represent dissolved nutrients and nutrient particles. Imaging of dye diffusion over time allowed for the comparison of mass transport rates under a series of rotation per minute (RPM) speeds for the High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs) on a Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV). This was done to determine the speed that will most accurately simulate the low convective rates experienced under actual µg conditions. Three biological replicates of the Burkholderia contaminans (B. contaminans) microbe were cultured under simulated µg with a rotating (R) control in the horizontal plane at the determined optimal RPM of 15, along with a stationary (S) reference culture. At T=0, and then at T=1,2,3 (in exponential phase) and T=4 (in S phase), the bacterial culture and ersatz were harvested for transcriptomic and nutrient content analysis, respectively. The experimental results illustrated that phosphate is a limiting nutrient in the WPA ersatz formula. Nutrient analysis illustrated that the µg treatment culture took up essential nutrients more rapidly than the R and S control cultures, yet non-essential nutrients remained higher in the µg treatment than in the controls at later timepoints. The rapid uptake and subsequent starvation of phosphate in the culture under µg conditions is further illustrated in the transcriptomic response when compared to that of the R control condition. The subsequent starvation response may serve as one element to explain a moderate enhancement of biofilm formation in the µg treatment. One implication of this work is that biofilm mitigation in the ISS environment could be supported by ensuring a steady flow of water as a vehicle for phosphate within the WPA to avoid complete phosphate consumption, which occurs in times of no flow and leads to undesired biofilm formation."

with minimal solar absorption, to perform exposure testing on these coatings (both rigid and sprayon), and to work towards a manufacturing process whereby these coatings could be made available to the space community. The Key Performance Parameters (threshold values) were to achieve 1% solar absorption for the tiles as measured in a deep space simulator, and 6% solar absorption for the spray-on coating as measured using a reflectance spectrometer. The values achieved were 1.2% (GRC Deep space simulator) and 4% (KSC spectrometer using Spectralon as a reference) for the tiles and spray-on coating, respectively. Exposure testing consisted of measuring tile and spray-on coating degradation due to atomic oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and electrostatic fields. Atomic oxygen caused some degradation, while ultraviolet exposure caused a significant increase in absorption. However, in-space samples exposed to solar ultraviolet did not show this significant increase. This discrepancy is addressed in this report.

As a result of this work, Y2O3 tiles have been manufactured in the Kennedy Space Center (KSC)
Applied Chemistry Laboratory (ACL), and the process has been transferred to the Thermal
Protection System Facility (TPSF) at KSC. The TPSF manufactures coatings for the space
community and is an ideal route by which future users could access Y2O3-based coatings. The
spray-on coating has been developed such that it can be applied to a wide range of substrates,
substantially lowering absorbed solar power as compared to currently available coatings."

Horizontal mesh refinement in CESM/CAM-chem-SE is unique and novel in that pollutants such as ozone are accurately represented at human exposure relevant scales while also directly including global feedbacks. CESM/CAM-chem-SE with mesh refinement down to ∼14 km over the conterminous US (CONUS) is the beginning of the Multi-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols (MUSICAv0). Here MUSICAv0 is evaluated and used to better understand how horizontal resolution and chemical complexity impact ozone and ozone precursors over CONUS as compared to measurements from five aircraft campaigns, which occurred in 2013. This field campaign analysis demonstrates the importance of using finer horizontal resolution to accurately simulate ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. In general, the impact of using more complex chemistry on ozone and other oxidation products is more pronounced when using finer horizontal resolution where a larger number of chemical regimes are resolved. Large model biases for ozone near the surface remain in the Southeast US as compared to the aircraft observations even with updated chemistry and finer horizontal resolution. This suggests a need for adding the capability of replacing sections of global emission inventories with regional inventories, increasing the vertical resolution in the planetary boundary layer, and reducing model biases in meteorological variables such as temperature and clouds."

The largest amplitude mode appeared to be similar to a symmetric mode. The same roughness patch immersed in a higher freestream acoustic noise environment showed little to no evidence of the instability modes. Instead, disturbances found in the boundary layer matched closely to the freestream spectra measured in the empty tunnel under the same conditions, indicating some evidence of freestream forcing in the boundary layer."

EBTEL solves for density, temperature, and pressure, averaged over the coronal part of the loop, velocity at coronal base, and the instantaneous differential emission measure distribution in the transition region. The current single-fluid version of the code, EBTEL2, assumes that at all stages the flows are subsonic. However, sometimes the solutions show the presence of supersonic flows during the impulsive phase of heat input. It is thus necessary to account for this effect. Here, we upgrade EBTEL2 to EBTEL3 by including the kinetic energy term in the Navier–Stokes equation. We compare the solutions from EBTEL3 with those obtained using EBTEL2, as well as the state-of-the-art field-aligned hydrodynamics code HYDRAD. We find that the match in pressure between EBTEL3 and HYDRAD is better than that between EBTEL2 and HYDRAD. Additionally, the velocities predicted by EBTEL3 are in close agreement with those obtained with HYDRAD when the flows are subsonic. However, EBTEL3 solutions deviate substantially from HYDRAD’s when the latter predicts supersonic flows. Using the mismatches in the solution, we propose a criterion to determine the conditions under which EBTEL can be used to study flows in the system."

A limited parameter study of the strength of the reconnecting field (or shear angle) was performed. An initially simple 1D equilibrium was used, consisting of a modified force-free current sheet, with periodic boundary conditions in all directions. In all cases, the linear and nonlinear evolution led to a primary current sheet between two large flux ropes. The global reconnection rate during this later stage was analyzed in all simulations. It was found that in 2.5D the primary current sheet fragmented owing to plasmoids, and as expected, the global reconnection rate, calculated using multiple methods, increases with the strength of the reconnecting field owing to a stronger Alfvén speed. In 3D, the presence of interacting oblique modes of the tearing instability complicates the simple 2.5D picture, entangling the magnetic field of the inflow and introducing a negative effect on the reconnection rate. The two competing effects of stronger Alfvén speed and entangling, which both increase with the strength of the reconnecting field, resulted in a decrease in the reconnection rate with
increasing reconnecting field. For all simulations, the 3D rates were less than in 2.5D but suggest that as one goes to weak reconnecting field (or strong guide field) the system becomes more 2.5D-like and the 2.5D and 3D rates converge. These results have relevance to situations like nanoflare heating and flare current sheets in the corona."

These mechanisms are highly dependent on how the magnetic field is stressed.

As recommended in Klimchuk et al. white paper, translational and rotational motions of the photospheric magnetic elements are important drivers of the coronal heating that must be accurately characterized. Yet despite an abundance of photospheric observations, many uncertainties remain in measuring these flows that entangle and twist the magnetic field.

This white paper states the current capacities for mapping the sun’s photospheric flows, with an emphasis on how to quantify the magnetic stress that builds up free energy and heats the corona. It also provides research avenues on how to go beyond our current limitations, so that the sun’s energy transport between the photosphere and the corona can be more accurately determined."

Further, electron precipitation is often poorly represented in atmospheric modeling. Additional investigations of the drivers and impacts of electron precipitation are needed to improve models and space weather forecasting requirements. To accurately represent the troposphere through the ionosphere in model simulations, it is vital to account for the chemistry accurately. Electron precipitation is a frequent, yet often ignored middle to high latitude forcing that can have dramatic effects on the middle and upper atmosphere. Over the past decade, several electron precipitation data sets have been developed, however, validation has been difficult due to the lack of independent observations of electron fluxes. Additionally, the limited number of satellites making measurements of global magnetospheric wave activity in concert with the resulting electron precipitation restricts our ability to accurately capture the drivers simultaneously with the precipitation. Accurate characterization of the drivers is needed for physics-based magnetosphere modeling. Likewise, accurate precipitating electron fluxes and relative energies are needed to improve our atmospheric modeling studies. Finally, in order to properly validate and improve our current modeling efforts, observations of atmospheric composition are necessary."

This test will be conducted in the Space Environment Simulator (SES) with the presence of Wavefront Error (WFE) due to gravity sag on the primary mirror. In this study, I incrementally decentered a piece of ground support equipment, the SubAperture Metrology System (SAMS), and evaluated how the phase retrieval algorithm attempted to fit the wavefront with the pupil mismatch.

In this work, we report two IPAR prediction models based on neural network (NN) approach, one for open ocean and the other for coastal waters. These models are trained, validated, and tested using a large volume of synthetic datasets for open ocean and coastal waters simulated by a radiative transfer model. Our NN models are designed to predict IPAR under a large range of atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The NN models can compute subsurface IPAR profile very accurately up to euphotic zone depth. The root mean square errors associated with the diffuse attenuation coefficient of IPAR are less than 0.011 𝑚−1 and 0.036 𝑚−1 for open ocean and coastal waters respectively. The performance of the NN models is better than presently available semi analytical models, with significant superiority in coastal waters."

SW1 is unique among the Centaurs in that it experiences quasi-regular major outbursts and produces CO emission continuously; however, the source of the CO is unclear. We argue that, due to its very large size (∼32 km radius), SW1 is likely still responding, via amorphous water ice (AWI) conversion to crystalline water ice (CWI), to the ""sudden"" change in its external thermal environment produced by its Myrs-long dynamical migration from the Kuiper Belt to its current location at the inner edge of the Centaur region. It is this conversion process that is the source of the abundant CO and dust released from the object during its quiescent and outburst phases. If correct, these arguments have a number of important predictions testable via remote sensing and in situ spacecraft characterization, including the quick release on Myr timescales of CO from AWI conversion for any few kilometer-scale scattered disk Kuiper Belt Objects transiting into the inner system; that to date SW1 has only converted between 50% and 65% of its nuclear AWI to CWI; that volume changes on AWI conversion could have caused subsidence and cave-ins, but not significant mass wasting or crater loss; that SW1's coma should contain abundant amounts of CWI+CO<sub>2</sub> ""dust"" particles; and that when SW1 transits into the inner system within the next 10,000 yr, it will be a very different kind of JFC."

The MAIA mission is collaborating with health science researchers and epidemiologists to study the impacts of air quality on health outcomes. TEMPO aims to improve our understanding of tropospheric air pollution chemistry and our ability to make predictions about air quality and climate forcing. TEMPO will offer hourly measurements of tropospheric ozone, aerosols, and clouds focused on North America at high-spatial resolution, while MAIA will produce high-resolution  measurements of  speciated particulate matter targeting densely populated cities around the globe. Data from these missions will help improve our understanding of the sources, types, and interactions among the aerosols and trace gases that are polluting Earth’s atmosphere, as well as our understanding of the impact of air pollution  on pollution on a wide range of important areas including human health, agriculture, weather, and climate change. The challenges of cross-disciplinary research, computationally expensive multi-variate analyses, and high-resolution data at both local and global scales are driving substantial changes across all of NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). High resolution data at scales such these requires a new approach to data ingest, archive, and publication. Like other NASA DAACs, the Atmospheric Science Data Center (ASDC), the DAAC that will be responsible for publishing MAIA and TEMPO data products has historically archived and distributed data on premise. DAACs of the future will archive and distribute data in the cloud, enabling them to remake themselves as research-focused data centers that will support  on-demand,  data-intensive computations for highly accurate retrospective analyses and predictions. Under the new paradigm, data formats and metadata must support on-demand spatial and temporal sub-setting, as well as other data transformation services such as re-gridding and re-sampling. This presentation will discuss work being done to address data formatting and metadata requirements in this dynamic new environment. In addition to the changes in data stewardship practices at the ASDC, the increased focus on supporting scientific research is driving changes in the relationship between DAACs and researchers. While the ASDC will continue to provide first rate data management and stewardship, it is increasingly focused on serving as a partner not only to the science teams that gather and produce the data it publishes, but to the researchers that use that data."
1010,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220019306,2023-08-03,The Turning Point of the Aerosol Era,"Over the CMIP6 historical period (1850–2014), aerosols provided the largest negative forcing compared to all other climate forcings via their ability to absorb or scatter solar radiation and alter clouds. Aerosols played an important role in counterbalancing warming by greenhouse gases (GHGs). Here we study aerosol forcing trends in the CMIP6 simulations of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ocean-atmosphere ModelE version 2.1 (GISS-E2.1-G) using a fully coupled atmospheric composition configuration, including interactive gas-phase chemistry, and either an aerosol microphysical (MATRIX) or a mass-based aerosol (OMA) module. Simulations of the CMIP6 historical period are analyzed as well as four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) future scenarios for 2015–2100: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. The main conclusion of this study is that aerosol forcing in the GISS model has reached its turning point, switching from globally increasing to a decreasing trend in the first decade of the 21st century. This result is robust, independent of which aerosol module or SSP scenario is used. Non-linear aerosol-cloud interactions dominate as a forcing agent over aerosol-radiation interactions. Aerosols' ability to counterbalance GHG forcing on the global scale is today at a level comparable to that at the beginning of the last century. In the 1980s, the decade of largest global aerosol loads, aerosols balanced up to 80% of GHG forcing. As a consequence, global warming of the last decades, which is primarily driven by greenhouse gases, has been augmented by the effect of decreasing aerosol cooling in our model. By the end of this century, following the SSP scenarios, aerosols will only counterbalance 0%–20% of GHG forcing, depending on model and on scenario."

old as the space program itself. Astronauts currently have access to 32 ounces of water through
a disposable in-suit drink bag (DIDB) while they are confined to their space suit. During the
Apollo program, methods for providing food/nutrition to crewmembers in space suits were
included as contingency solutions (1) but were eventually abandoned. The main reasons that
provision of in-suit nutrition beyond water was discontinued after Apollo were the complicated
engineering requirements, the additional mass and volume that was required for the applicable
food formulations, hardware needed for a suit-specialized food system, and because the
perceived need for in-suit nutrition during EVAs was not sufficient during the Space Shuttle and
the International Space Station (ISS) eras. A custom-made 165-kcal fruit bar was fitted into the
EVA suit during the Space Shuttle program, but crewmembers rarely consumed it during the
EVA and rather chose to consume it before or after suited activities (2). Since 2011, between 4
and 13 EVAs have been conducted from the ISS each year, with durations ranging from 1:32 to
8:17 hours (https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/spacewalks ). It has been acceptable for the
crewmembers to schedule food intake around these relatively infrequent suited activities.
Because upcoming Artemis missions will include nominal 8-hour lunar exploration EVAs that are
expected to increase in frequency to several (4 to 5) sorties per week (3), the desire for an in-suit nutrition system has increased. In preparation for these missions, requirements to provide
in-suit nutrition has been outlined in the most recent NASA Human Spaceflight Standards
documents (4). Establishing general recommendations for in-suit nutrition systems precedes the
selection of a lunar EVA pressure suit system. The current document is intended to define the
rationale for nutrition to support EVA (whether in-suit or from the pantry in the habitat),
document the requirements, constraints, and crewmember preferences, and recommend
necessary next steps for developing an in-suit EVA nutrition system.

Assessments presented in this report include a review of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) food
products as potential in-suit formulations, a comparison of conceptual designs for delivering
nutrition to a crewmember while confined to a space suit, an evaluation of space suit volume
constraints for the placement of in-suit nutrition systems, and feedback from astronauts
regarding preferences for nutrition support during EVA. Based on these assessments,
recommendations were formulated that can be used to help develop a method to deliver
nutrition safely and acceptably to a crewmember while they are confined to a space suit for an
EVA duration of up to 8 hours, and a total time in the suit of up to 12 hours."

While the overall NO<sub>2</sub> decline over some large cities is well-established, understanding the details remains a challenge since multiple source categories contribute. In this study, a new method of isolation of three components (background NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> from urban sources, and NO<sub>2</sub> from industrial point sources) is applied to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on each of them. The approach is based on fitting satellite data by a statistical model with empirical plume dispersion functions driven by a meteorological reanalysis. Population density and surface elevation data as well as coordinates of industrial sources were used in the analysis. The tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> vertical column density (VCD) values measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor over 261 urban areas for the period from 16 March to 15 June 2020 were compared with the average VCD values for the same period in 2018 and 2019. While the background NO<sub>2</sub> component remained almost unchanged, the urban NO<sub>2</sub> component declined by −18 % to −28 % over most regions. India, South America, and a part of Europe (particularly, Italy, France, and Spain) demonstrated a −40 % to −50 % urban emission decline. In contrast, the decline over urban areas in China, where the lockdown was over during the analysed period, was, on average, only -4.4± 8 %. Emissions from large industrial sources in the analysed urban areas varied greatly from region to region from -4.8 ± 6 % for China to -40 ± 10 % for India. Estimated changes in urban emissions are correlated with changes in Google mobility data (the correlation coefficient is 0.62) confirming that changes in traffic were one of the key elements in the decline in urban NO2 emissions. No correlation was found between changes in background NO2 and Google mobility data. On the global scale, the background and urban components were remarkably stable in 2018, 2019, and 2021, with averages of all analysed areas all being within ±2.5 % and suggesting that there were no substantial drifts or shifts in TROPOMI data. The 2020 data are clearly an outlier: in 2020, the mean background component for all analysed areas (without China) was -6.0 % ± 1.2 % and the mean urban component was -26.7 ± 2.6 % or 20σ below the baseline level from the other years."

They often mediate protein–protein interactions in a diversity of biological systems. These proteins have an elongated non-globular shape and often display complex folding mechanisms. This work investigates the energy landscape of representative proteins of this class made up of 3, 4 and 6 ANK repeats using the energy-landscape visualisation method (ELViM). By combining biased and unbiased coarse-grained molecular dynamics AWSEM simulations that sample conformations along the folding trajectories with the ELViM structure-based phase space, one finds a three-dimensional representation of the globally funnelled energy surface. In this representation, it is possible to delineate distinct folding pathways. We show that ELViMs can project, in a natural way, the intricacies of the highly dimensional energy landscapes encoded by the highly symmetric ankyrin repeat proteins into useful low-dimensional representations. These projections can discriminate between multiplicities of specific parallel folding mechanisms that otherwise can be hidden in oversimplified depictions."

On the early Earth, pyrite weathering by atmospheric oxygen was severely limited, and low marine sulfate concentrations persisted for much of the Archean eon. Here, we show an anoxic photochemical mechanism of pyrite weathering that could have provided substantial amounts of sulfate to the oceans as continents formed in the late Archean. Pyrite grains suspended in anoxic ferrous iron solutions produced millimolar sulfate concentrations when irradiated with ultraviolet light. The Fe2+(aq) was photooxidized, which, in turn, led to the chemical oxidation of pyritic sulfur. Additional experiments conducted with 2.68 Ga shale demonstrated that photochemically derived ferric iron oxidizes and dissolves sedimentary pyrite during chemical weathering. The results suggest that before the rise of atmospheric oxygen, oxidative pyrite weathering on Archean continents was controlled by the exposure of land to sunlight."

The earliest minerals in stellar, nebular, asteroid, and primitive Earth contexts were dominated by relatively abundant chemical elements, notably H, C, O, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe. Significant mineral diversification subsequently occurred via two main processes, first through gradual selection and concentration of rarer elements by fluid-rock interactions (for example, in hydrothermal metal deposits, complex granite pegmatites, and agpaitic rocks), and then through near-surface biologically mediated oxidation and weathering. 

We find that 3349 mineral species (59.2%) are known from only one paragenetic context, whereas another 1372 species (24.2%) are associated with two paragenetic modes. Among the most genetically varied minerals are pyrite, albite, hornblende, corundum, magnetite, calcite, hematite, rutile, and baryte, each with 15 or more known modes of formation. 

Among the most common paragenetic modes of minerals are near-surface weathering/oxidation (1998 species), subsurface hydrothermal deposition (859 species), and condensation at volcanic fumaroles (459 species). In addition, many species are associated with compositionally extreme environments of highly differentiated igneous lithologies, including agpaitic rocks (726 species), complex granite pegmatites (564 species), and carbonatites and related carbonate-bearing magmas (291 species). Biological processes lead to at least 2707 mineral species, primarily as a consequence of oxidative weathering but also through coal-related and other taphonomic minerals (597 species), as well as anthropogenic minerals, for example as byproducts of mining (603 minerals). However, contrary to previous estimates, we find that only ~34% of mineral species form exclusively as a consequence of biological processes. By far the most significant factor in enhancing Earth’s mineral diversity has been its dynamic hydrological cycle. At least 4583 minerals—81% of all species—arise through water-rock interactions.

 A timeline for mineral-forming events suggests that much of Earth’s mineral diversity was established within the first 250 million years. If life is rare in the universe, then this view of a mineralogically diverse early Earth provides many more plausible reactive pathways over a longer timespan than previous models. If, however, life is a cosmic imperative that emerges on any mineral- and water-rich world, then these findings support the hypothesis that life on Earth developed rapidly in the early stages of planetary evolution"

Early in its history, Mars experienced an atmospheric redox change and iron-bearing clay minerals may preserve the effects of that transition. Ferrous smectites, the thermodynamically predicted product of chemical weathering of basalts under anoxic conditions, may have undergone oxidation by exposure to chemical oxidants in the atmosphere or regolith, or by direct photooxidation at the surface. To assess these potential oxidation pathways, ferrous trioctahedral smectites of varying initial iron content were synthesized and subjected to oxidation by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Experimental UV irradiation under an anoxic atmosphere equivalent to approximately 7 years of flux on the Martian surface caused partial oxidation of smectite-bound Fe (Fe3+/ΣFe = 16–18%) and octahedral sheet contraction. Metal-OH vibrational bands in visible/near infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra of oxidized smectites changed in band depth and asymmetry with higher iron content. X-ray diffraction patterns of UV irradiated samples indicate the formation of a mixed di- and trioctahedral smectite or a secondary nontronite phase, possibly on the surfaces of higher iron content smectites. These experiments suggest that UV irradiation is able to oxidize structurally bound iron in smectites without the presence of other chemical oxidants. Photooxidation may have influenced the mineralogy, both syndepositionally and postdepositionally, of Martian alteration assemblages formed near the surface and this process needs not be limited to one part of their formation history. 

Plain Language Summary:
Martian mineral assemblages observed with orbiters and rover instruments allow us to understand the planet's past climate and aqueous activity. Hydrated minerals that contain Fe(II) are of particular interest as they would have been affected by the early atmosphere becoming more oxidizing overtime, changing the structural iron into Fe(III). In this study, we synthesized Fe(II) smectites with varying iron content and irradiated them with an ultraviolet (UV) light source to test whether they could be photooxidized. Iron in the smectite minerals was incompletely oxidized by UV radiation after being exposed for the equivalent of approximately 7 years of exposure on the early Mars surface. The smectites with higher iron content showed more changes with photooxidation in their visible/near infrared spectra as well as in their X-ray diffraction patterns, two datasets collected by instruments on currently active Martian missions. These results suggest that UV photooxidation is a plausible contributor to the mineralogy and redox state of clay mineral assemblages observed at the Martian surface."

Typically an SAS is modeled as a feedback loop that functions within an existing system, with operations including monitoring, analyzing, planning, and executing (i.e., MAPE-K) to enable online reconfiguration. This paper presents a conceptual approach for extending software engineering artifacts to be self-adaptive within the context of game design.

The ensuing thermospheric variations created rare display of extreme poleward-expanding conjugate plasma bubbles seen in the rate of total electron content index over 100–150°E, reaching ∼40°N geographic latitude. This is associated with fluctuations in FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F7/C2) ion-density measurements and spread-F in ionograms. Preceding to this, an unusually strong pre-reversal enhancement (PRE) occurred in the global ionospheric specification (GIS) electron density profiles derived from F7/C2 observations. The GIS also revealed a decrease of equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) crest density due to the storm impact. Reduced E-region conductivity by volcano-induced waves and enhanced F-region wind, further accelerated by reduced ion-drag over the EIA, apparently intensified the PRE.
Accompanied with the strong PRE, volcano-induced seed perturbations triggered the super plasma bubble activity."

However, lower-order moment-based methods (e.g., partial variance of increments; PVI) are deemed more appropriate for examining the evolution of the bulk of coherent structures (CSs), PVI ≥ 3. Using PVI, we observe a scale-dependent evolution in the fraction of the data set occupied by CSs, fPVI≥3. Specifically, regardless of the SW speed, a subtle increase is found in fPVI≥3 for ℓ = 20 di, in contrast to a more pronounced radial increase in CSs observed at larger scales. Intermittency is investigated in relation to plasma parameters. Though, slower SW speed intervals exhibit higher fPVI≥6 and higher kurtosis maxima, no statistical differences are observed for fPVI≥3. Highly Alfvénic intervals display lower levels of intermittency. The anisotropy with respect to the angle between the magnetic field and SW flow, ΘVB is investigated. Intermittency is weaker at ΘVB ≈ 0° and is strengthened at larger angles. Considering the evolution at a constant alignment angle, a weakening of intermittency is observed with increasing advection time of the SW. Our results indicate that the strengthening of intermittency in the inner heliosphere is driven by the increase in comparatively highly intermittent perpendicular intervals sampled by the probes with increasing distance, an effect related directly to the evolution of the Parker spiral."

We find the map of residual speed errors are systematic when examined as a function of fp and d. We use these residual error maps to apply corrections to the model speeds. We test this correction approach using 3-day lead time speed forecasts for an entire year of observations and model results. Our methods can readily be applied to develop corrections for the remaining WSA forecast lead times which range from 1 to 7 days in 1-day increments. Since the solar wind density, temperature, and the interplanetary magnetic field strength all correlate well with the solar wind speed, the improved accuracy of solar wind speed forecasts enables the production of multiday forecasts of the solar wind density, temperature, pressure, and interplanetary field strength, and geophysical indices. These additional parameters would expand the usefulness of Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport-WSA forecasts for space weather clients."

been operating since 2006, returning high-resolution data in the 170 – 212 and 246 – 292 Å wavelength regions. EIS has four slit options, with the narrow 1′′ and 2′′ slits used for spectroscopy and the wide 40′′ and 266′′ slits used for monochromatic imaging. In this article
several properties of the 40′′ slit (or slot) are measured using the Fe XII 195.12 Å line, which
is formed at 1.5 MK. The projected width of the slot on the detector shows a small variation
along the slit with an average value of 40.949′′. The slot image is tilted on the detector and
a quadratic formula is provided to describe the tilt. The tilt corresponds to four pixels on
the detector and the slot centroid is offset mostly to the right (longer wavelengths) of the
1′′ slit by up to four pixels. Measurement of the intensity decrease at the edge of the slot
leads to an estimate of the spatial resolution of the images in the x-direction. The resolution varies quadratically along the slot, with a minimum value of 2.9′′ close to the detector
center. Intensities measured from the slot images are found to be on average 14% higher
than those measured from the 1′′ slit at the same spatial location. Background subtraction is
necessary to derive accurate intensities in quiet-Sun and coronal-hole regions. Prescriptions
for deriving accurate slot intensities for different types of slot datasets are presented."

Despite this interest, it remains uncertain how different ion species respond to energy input, what defines the upper and lower bounds of the ion flux, and what role solar illumination plays in regulating the relationship between energy input and ion upflows/outflows. This work simulates how ion flux scales with low and high altitude energization, and to a combination of both. Furthermore, we examine the influence of solar illumination on these relationships by considering how the scaling of ion flux with energy input changes over the solar cycle, comparing solar minimum and maximum, as well as how they change from day to night conditions. We find O<sup>-+</sup> flux tends to respond more strongly to energy inputs than H<sup>-+</sup> flux, with the O<sup>-+</sup> flux often exhibiting a lower activation energy and a greater dynamic range. The lower bound of the ion flux at 4,000 km is typically defined by the polar wind H<sup>-+</sup>, although O<sup>-+</sup> upflows can dominate at low altitudes in the presence of significant frictional heating of the ion gas or soft electron precipitation. However, when significant soft electron precipitation and wave-particle interactions are present simultaneously the lower bound of the ion flux at 4,000 km is defined by the O<sup>-+</sup>. Finally, we find a difference between the steady state response of the outflow to energy input and the peak response."

Below this transition, the rover detected crystalline Ca-sulfates with minor Fe-sulfates but also found that some fraction of a rock's bulk SO<sub>3</sub> is often in the poorly constrained X-ray amorphous component. Here, we characterize the abundances and compositions of the X-ray amorphous sulfur-bearing phases in 19 drilled samples using a mass balance approach, and in a subset of 5 samples using evolved SO<sub>2</sub> gas measured using the SAM instrument. We find that ∼20–90 wt% of a sample's bulk SO<sub>3</sub> is in the X-ray amorphous state and that X-ray amorphous sulfur-bearing phase compositions are consistent with mixtures of Mg-S, Fe-S, and possibly Ca-S phases, likely sulfates or sulfites. These phases reside in the bedrock, perhaps as cementing agents deposited with detrital sediments or during early diagenesis, and in diagenetic alteration halos deposited after lithification during late diagenesis. The likely presence of highly soluble Mg-sulfates in the rocks suggests negligible fluid flow through the bedrock post-Mg-sulfate deposition. The X-ray amorphous sulfur-bearing phases probably became amorphous through dehydration in the current Martian atmosphere or inside the CheMin instrument. X-ray amorphous sulfur-bearing materials likely contribute to orbital spectral detections of sulfates, and so our results help form multiple hypotheses to be tested in the sulfate unit and are important for understanding the evolution of the Martian surface environment at Gale crater."

The spectral maps of various emission lines reveal a stratified ionization geometry in N44 D1. The spatial distribution of [O ו] λ6300 emission in N44 D1 indicates a partially covered ionization front at the outer boundary of the H װ region. These observations reveal that N44 D1 is a blister H װ region. The [O ו] λ6300 emission in N44 C does not provide a well-defined ionization front at the boundary, while patches of [S װ] λ6717 and [O ו] λ6300 emission bars are found in the interior. The results of spatially resolved MUSE spectra are tested with the photoionization models for the first time in these H װ regions. A spherically symmetric ionization-bounded model with a partial covering factor, which is appropriate for a blister H װ region, can well reproduce the observed geometry and most of the diagnostic line ratios in N44 D1. Similarly, in N44 C we apply a low-density and optically thin model based on the observational signatures. Our modeling results show that the ionization structure and physical conditions of N44 D1 are mainly determined by the radiation from an O5 V star. However, local X-rays, possibly from supernovae or stellar wind, play a key role. In N44 C, the main contribution is from three ionizing stars."

CAL is sensitive to electrons up to 20 TeV, cosmic-ray nuclei from Z=1 throughZ∼40, and gamma rays over the range1 GeV–10 TeV. CGBM observes gamma rays from 7 keV to 20 MeV. The combined CAL-CGBM instrument has conducted a search for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)since 2015 October. We report here on the results of a search for X-ray/gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events reported during the LIGO/Virgo observing run O3. No events have been detected that pass all acceptance criteria. We describe the components, performance, and triggering algorithms of the CGBM—the two Hard X-ray Monitors consisting of LaBr3(Ce)scintillators sensitive to 7 keV–1 MeV gamma rays and a Soft Gamma-ray Monitor BGO scintillator sensitive to 40 keV–20 MeV—and the high-energy CAL consisting of a charge detection module, imaging calorimeter, and the fully active total absorption calorimeter.

The BASCOE stratospheric data are interpolated to the S5P observations and subtracted from the TROPOMI total ozone data. The difference is equal to the tropospheric ozone residual column from the surface up to the tropopause. The tropospheric ozone columns are retrieved at the full spatial resolution of the TROPOMI sensor (5.5×3.5 km<sup>2</sup>) with daily global coverage.

Compared to the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications 2 (OMPS-MERRA-2) data, a global mean positive bias of 3.3 DU is found for the analysed period April 2018 to June 2020. A small negative bias of about −0.91 DU is observed in the tropics relative to the operational TROPOMI tropical tropospheric data based on the convective cloud differential (CCD) algorithm throughout the same period. The new tropospheric ozone data (S5P-BASCOE) are compared to a set of globally distributed ozonesonde data integrated up to the tropopause level. We found 2254 comparisons with cloud-free TROPOMI observations within 25 km of the stations. In the global mean, S5P-BASCOE deviates by 2.6 DU from the integrated ozonesondes. Depending on the latitude the S5P-BASCOE deviate from the sondes and between −4.8 and 7.9 DU, indicating a good agreement. However, some exceptional larger positive deviations up to 12 DU are found, especially in the northern polar regions (north of 70∘). The monthly mean tropospheric column and time series for selected areas showed the expected spatial and temporal pattern, such as the wave one structure in the tropics or the seasonal cycle, including a summer maximum, in the mid-latitudes."

We investigate simultaneous multipoint in-situ spacecraft and ground-based measurements to determine the role of Kelvin-Helmholtz waves at the Earth’s magnetopause and the low-latitude boundary layer in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling process. Nonlinear Kelvin-Helmholtz waves develop into flow vortices that twist and/or shear flux tube magnetic fields, thereby generating localized field-aligned currents. Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices on the dusk (dawn) flanks of the magnetosphere generate clockwise (counter-clockwise) rotations and upward (downward) field-aligned currents inside the flux tubes, consistent with the region-1 field-aligned current. We present in-situ MMS and Cluster spacecraft observations of Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices at the magnetopause that map to the poleward edge of the auroral regions. The FAST spacecraft and the ground-based magnetometers from which spherical elementary currents (acting as a proxy for vertical currents) can be calculated observe corresponding field-aligned current signatures. This study demonstrates the role played by the Kelvin-Helmholtz waves in linking magnetopause boundary fluctuations to ionospheric phenomena."

SCOAPE addressed both technological and scientific issues related to measuring NO2 columns over the Outer Continental Shelf. Featured were nitrogen dioxide (NO2) instruments (Pandora, Teledyne API analyzer) at Cocodrie, LA (29.26°, -90.66°), and on the Research Vessel Point Sur operating off the Louisiana coast with measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOC). The findings: (1) All NO2 observations revealed two atmospheric regimes over the Gulf, the first influenced by tropical air in 10-14 May, the second influenced by flow from urban areas on 15-17 May; (2) Comparisons of OMI v4 and TROPOMI v1.3 TC (total column) NO2 data with shipboard Pandora NO2 column observations averaged 13% agreement with the largest difference during 15-17 May (~20%). At Cocodrie, the satellite-Pandora agreement was ~5%. (3) Three new-model Pandora instruments displayed a TC NO2 precision of 0.01 Dobson Units (~5%); (4) Regions of smaller, older natural gas operations showed high methane readings from leakage; elevated VOC were also detected. Neither satellite nor spectrometer captured the magnitude of ambient NO2 variability near ONG platforms. Given an absence of regular air quality monitoring over the Gulf of Mexico, SCOAPE data constitute a baseline against which future observations can be compared."

The technique involves adaptive spatiotemporal tracking of propagating intensity gradients and their characterization in terms of time-evolving Keplerian areas swept out by the position vectors of moving plasma blobs. Whereas gravity induces purely ballistic motions consistent with Kepler's second law, noncentral forces such as the Lorentz force introduce nonzero torques resulting in more complex motions. KODA algorithms enable direct evaluation of the line-of-sight component of the net torque density from the image-plane projection of the areal acceleration. The method is applied to the prominence eruption of 2011 June 7, observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. Results obtained include quantitative estimates of the magnetic forces, field intensities, and blob masses and energies across a vast region impacted by the postreconnection redistribution of the prominence material. The magnetic pressure and energy are strongly dominant during the early, rising phase of the eruption, while the dynamic pressure and kinetic energy become significant contributors during the subsequent falling phases. Measured intensive properties of the prominence blobs are consistent with those of typical active-region prominences; measured extensive properties are compared with those of the whole pre-eruption prominence and the post-eruption coronal mass ejection of 2011 June 7, all derived by other investigators and techniques. We show that KODA provides valuable information on spatially and temporally dependent characteristics of coronal eruptions that is not readily available via alternative means, thereby shedding new light on the environment and evolution of these solar events."

Despite extensive research, the mechanistic details of ATP-dependent energy transduction and dinitrogen reduction by nitrogenase are not well understood, requiring new strategies to monitor its structural dynamics during catalytic action. Here we report the cryogenic electron microscopic interrogation of the nitrogenase complex under enzymatic turnover conditions, which has enabled the structural characterization of the nitrogenase reaction intermediates at high resolution for the first time. Our structures show that asymmetry governs all aspects of nitrogenase mechanism including ATP hydrolysis, protein-protein interactions, and catalysis. Furthermore, they reveal several previously unobserved, mechanistically relevant conformational changes near the catalytic iron-molybdenum cofactor that are correlated with the nucleotide-hydrolysis state of the enzyme."

Candidate Radio and Stellar Sources,"Recent MeerKAT radio continuum observations of the Galactic Centre at 20 cm show a large population of non-thermal radio filaments (NRFs) in the inner few hundred pc of the Galaxy. We have selected a sample of 57 radio sources, mainly compact objects, in the MeerKAT mosaic image that appear to be associated with NRFs. The selected sources are about four times the number of radio point sources associated with filaments than would be expected by random chance. Furthermore, an apparent correlation between bright IR stars and NRFs is inferred from their similar latitude distributions, suggesting that they both co-exist within the same region. To examine if compact radio sources are related to compact IR sources, we have used archival 2MASS, and Spitzer data to make spectral energy distribution of individual stellar sources coincident or close to radio sources. We provide a catalogue of radio and IR sources for future detailed observations to investigate a potential three-way physical association between NRFs, compact radio and IR stellar sources. This association is suggested by models in which NRFs are cometary tails produced by the interaction of a large-scale nuclear outflow with stellar wind bubbles in the Galactic Centre."

Its equatorial ring, filled with material expelled from the progenitor star about 20 000 yr ago, has been engulfed with SN blast waves. Shocks heat dust grains in the ring, emitting their energy at mid-infrared (IR) wavelengths We present ground-based 10–18 μm monitoring of the ring of SN 1987A from day 6067 to 12814 at a resolution of 0.5 arcsec, together with SOFIA photometry at 10–30 μm. The IR images in the 2000’s (day 6067–7242) showed that the shocks first began brightening the east side of the ring. Later, our mid-IR images from 2017 to 2022 (day 10952–12714) show that dust emission is now fading in the east, while it has brightened on the west side of the ring. Because dust grains are heated in the shocked plasma, which can emit X-rays, the IR and X-ray brightness ratio represent shock diagnostics. Until 2007 the IR to X-ray brightness ratio remained constant over time, and during this time shocks seemed to be largely influencing the east side of the ring. However, since then, the IR to X-ray ratio has been declining, due to increased X-ray brightness. Whether the declining IR brightness is because of dust grains being destroyed or being cooled in the post-shock regions will require more detailed modelling."

The morphology of a sample of 43 groupings containing 174 magnetized radio filaments are presented. Many grouped filaments show harp-like, fragmented cometary tail-like, or loop-like structures in contrast to many straight filaments running mainly perpendicular to the Galactic plane. There are many striking examples of a single filament splitting into two prongs at a junction, suggestive of a flow of plasma along the filaments. Spatial variations in spectral index, brightness, bending, and sharpening along the filaments indicate that they are evolving on a 105−6-yr time-scale. The mean spacings between parallel filaments in a given grouping peaks at ∼16 arcsec. We argue by modeling that the filaments in a grouping all lie on the same plane and that the groupings are isotropically oriented in 3D space. One candidate for the origin of filamentation is interaction with an obstacle, which could be a compact radio source, before a filament splits and bends into multiple filaments. In this picture, the obstacle or sets the length scale of the separation between the filaments. Another possibility is synchrotron cooling instability occurring in cometary tails formed as a result of the interaction of cosmic ray driven Galactic centre outflow with obstacles such as stellar winds. In this picture, the mean spacing and the mean width of the filaments are expected to be a fraction of a parsec, consistent with observed spacing."

Part II: Building an Error Model Through Spectral System Identification,"Satellite  precipitation  products,  as all quantitative  estimates,  come with  some inherent degree  of uncertainty. To associate  a  quantitative value of the uncertainty  to  each  individual estimate,  error  modeling  is  necessary. Most  of  the  error  models proposed so  far compute the uncertainty as a function of precipitation intensity only, and only at one specific spatio-temporal scale. We  propose a spectral  error  model  which accounts for the neighboring space-time dynamics of  precipitation into  the  uncertainty  quantification. Systematic  distortions  of  the precipitation  signal  and  random  errors  are  characterized  distinctively  in  every  frequency-wavenumber band in  the Fourier domain,  to accurately characterize  error  across  scales.  The systematic  distortions  are  represented as a  deterministic  space-time linear filtering term.  The random  errors  are  represented  as  a  non-stationary  additive  noise. The spectral error  model  is applied  to  the  IMERG  multi satellite  precipitation  product and  its  parameters  are  estimated empirically   through   a   system   identification   approach using   the   GV-MRMS   gauge-radar measurements as reference (“truth”) over the eastern United States. The filtering term is found to be  essentially  low-pass. While  traditional  error  models attribute  most  of  the  error  variance  to random  errors, it  is  found here that  the  systematic  filtering  term  explains  48%  of  the  error variance at the native resolution of IMERG. This fact confirms that,  at high resolution, filtering effects in satellite  precipitation  products cannot  be  ignored,  and  that  the  error cannot  be represented as a purely random additive or multiplicative term. An important consequence is that precipitation   estimates   derived   from   totally   different   sources   shall   not   be   expected   to automatically have statistically independent errors."

They play a significant role in the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Foreshock transient phenomena, associated with variations in the solar wind dynamic pressure, deform the magnetopause, and in turn generates field-aligned currents (FACs) connected to the auroral ionosphere. Solar wind dynamic pressure variations and transient phenomena at the dayside magnetopause drive magnetospheric ultra low frequency (ULF) waves, which can play an important role in the dynamics of Earth’s radiation belts. These transient phenomena and their geoeffects have been investigated using coordinated in-situ spacecraft observations, spacecraft-borne imagers, ground-based observations, and numerical simulations. Cluster, THEMIS, Geotail, and MMS multi-mission observations allow us to track the motion and time evolution of transient phenomena at different spatial and temporal scales in detail, whereas ground-based experiments can observe the ionospheric projections of transient magnetopause phenomena such as waves on the magnetopause driven by hot flow anomalies or flux transfer events produced by bursty reconnection across their full longitudinal and latitudinal extent. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), hybrid, and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are powerful tools to simulate the dayside transient phenomena. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the present understanding of dayside transient phenomena at Earth and other planets, their geoeffects, and outstanding questions."

We have used TESS data to study rotational modulation in the light curves of a sample of chemically peculiar stars with measured large-scale magnetic fields (mCP stars). In general, mCP stars show inhomogeneous distributions of elements in their atmospheres that lead to spectroscopic (line profile) and photometric (light curve) variations commensurate with the rotational period. We analyzed the available TESS data from 50 sectors for eight targets after post-processing them in order to minimize systematic instrumental trends. Analysis of the light curves allowed us to determine rotational periods for all eight of our targets. For each star, we provide a phase diagram calculated using the derived period from the light curves and from the available measurements of the disc-averaged longitudinal magnetic field B(sub z). In most cases, the phased light curve and B(sub z) measurements show consistent variability. Using our rotation periods, and global stellar parameters derived from fitting Balmer line profiles, and from Geneva and Strömgren–Crawford photometry, we determined the equatorial rotational velocities and calculated the respective critical rotational fractions v(sub eq)/v(crit). We have shown from our sample that the critical rotational fraction decreases with stellar age, at a rate consistent with the magnetic braking observed in the larger population of mCP stars."

Our new discovery 2021 PH27 has the smallest semimajor axis known for an asteroid, 0.4617 au, and the largest general relativistic effects (53 arcsec/century) known for any body in the solar system. The survey has detected ∼15% of all known Atira NEOs. We put strong constraints on any stable population of Venus co-orbital resonance objects existing, as well as the Atira and Vatira asteroid classes. These interior asteroid populations are important to complete the census of asteroids near Earth, including some of the most likely Earth impactors that cannot easily be discovered in other surveys. Comparing the actual population of asteroids found interior to Earth and Venus with those predicted to exist by extrapolating from the known population exterior to Earth is important to better understand the origin, composition, and structure of the NEO population."

Creating more efficient schedules for follow-up will lead to a commensurate increase in counterpart location efficiency without using more telescope time. Widely used in operations research and telescope scheduling, mixed-integer linear programming is a strong candidate to produce these higher-efficiency schedules, as it can make use of powerful commercial solvers that find globally optimal solutions to provided problems. We detail a new target-of-opportunity scheduling algorithm designed with Zwicky Transient Facility in mind that uses mixed-integer linear programming. We compare its performance to gwemopt, the tuned heuristic scheduler used by the Zwicky Transient Facility and other facilities during the third LIGO–Virgo gravitational-wave observing run. This new algorithm uses variable-length observing blocks to enforce cadence requirements and to ensure field observability, along with having a secondary optimization step to minimize slew time. We show that by employing a hybrid method utilizing both this scheduler and gwemopt, the previous scheduler used, in concert, we can achieve an average improvement in detection efficiency of 3%–11% over gwemopt alone for a simulated binary neutron star merger data set consistent with LIGO–Virgo's third observing run, highlighting the potential of mixed-integer target of opportunity schedulers for future multimessenger follow-up surveys."

It will also provide transformative new observing capabilities for every area of astrophysics, and to heliophysics and planetary physics as well. LEM’s main goal is a comprehensive look at the physics of galaxy formation, including stellar and black-hole feedback and flows of baryonic matter into and out of galaxies. These processes are best studied in X-rays; as emphasized by the 2020 Decadal Survey, emission-line mapping is the pressing need in this area. LEM will use a large microcalorimeter array/IFU (that builds on Athena XIFU technology developments), covering a 30 × 300 field with 1000 angular resolution, to map the soft Xray line emission from objects that constitute galactic ecosystems. These include supernova remnants, star-forming regions, superbubbles, galactic outflows (such as the Fermi/eROSITA bubbles in the Milky Way and their analogs in other galaxies), the Circumgalactic Medium in the Milky Way and other galaxies, and the Intergalactic Medium at the outskirts and beyond the confines of galaxies and clusters. LEM’s 1–2 eV spectral resolution in the 0.2–2 keV band will make it possible to disentangle the faintest emission lines in those objects from the bright Milky Way foreground, providing groundbreaking measurements of the physics of these plasmas, from temperatures, densities, chemical composition to gas dynamics. While the mission is optimized to provide critical observations that will push our understanding of galaxy formation, LEM will provide transformative capability for all classes of astrophysical objects, from the Earth’s magnetosphere, planets and comets to the interstellar medium and X-ray binaries in nearby galaxies, AGN, and cooling gas in galaxy clusters. In addition to pointed observations, LEM will perform a shallow all-sky survey that will dramatically expand the discovery space."

We present a coseismic slip model for the 2021 M8.2 Chignik earthquake and investigate the relationship of this earthquake to previous major events in the Alaska Peninsula region and to interseismic coupling. Stress changes from the 2020 M7.8 Simeonof event triggered the Chignik event, and together, the earthquakes partially filled an unruptured section along a 3000-km subduction margin that has experienced a series of ruptures along almost its entire length over the past century. Variations in coupling and structural characteristics may make the region more prone to nucleating M7 to M8 events rather than larger M > 8.5 earthquakes. Stress changes and rupture areas suggest that the two recent earthquakes may be part of an 80-year-long rupture cascade and may have advanced seismic hazard in the region."

Upper Centaurus–Lupus (UCL; ∼136 pc, ∼16 Myr) and Lower Centaurus–Crux (LCC; ∼115 pc, ∼17 Myr). We
find spot-modulated periods (P) for ∼90% of members. The range of light-curve and periodogram shapes echoes
that found for other clusters with K2, but fewer multiperiod stars may be an indication of the different noise
characteristics of TESS, or a result of the source selection methods here. The distribution of P as a function of color
as a proxy for mass fits nicely in between that for both older and younger clusters observed by K2, with fast
rotators being found among both the highest and lowest masses probed here, and a well-organized distribution of
M-star rotation rates. About 13% of the stars have an infrared excess, suggesting a circumstellar disk; this is well
matched to expectations, given the age of the stars. There is an obvious pileup of disked M stars at P ∼ 2 days, and
the pileup may move to shorter P as the mass decreases. There is also a strong concentration of disk-free M stars at
P ∼ 2 days, hinting that perhaps these stars have recently freed themselves from their disks. Exploring the rotation
rates of stars in UCL/LCC has the potential to help us understand the beginning of the end of the influence of disks
on rotation, and the timescale on which stars respond to unlocking."

Mic b, we introduce three Spitzer (4.5 μm) transits, five TESS transits, 11 LCO transits, one PEST transit, one
Brierfield transit, and two transit timing measurements from Rossiter–McLaughlin observations; for AU Mic c, we
introduce three TESS transits. We present two independent TTV analyses. First, we use EXOFASTv2 to jointly
model the Spitzer and ground-based transits and obtain the midpoint transit times. We then construct an O − C
diagram and model the TTVs with Exo-Striker. Second, we reproduce our results with an independent
photodynamical analysis. We recover a TTV mass for AU Mic c of -10.8+2.22.3 M⊕. We compare the TTV-derived
constraints to a recent radial velocity (RV) mass determination. We also observe excess TTVs that do not appear to
be consistent with the dynamical interactions of b and c alone or due to spots or flares. Thus, we present a
hypothetical nontransiting “middle-d” candidate exoplanet that is consistent with the observed TTVs and candidate
RV signal and would establish the AU Mic system as a compact resonant multiplanet chain in a 4:6:9 period
commensurability. These results demonstrate that the AU Mic planetary system is dynamically interacting,
producing detectable TTVs, and the implied orbital dynamics may inform the formation mechanisms for this
young system. We recommend future RV and TTV observations of AU Mic b and c to further constrain the masses
and confirm the existence of possible additional planet(s)."

As a fast CME propagates through interplanetary space, it accumulates solar wind materials at its front. This pileup of materials, or CME-driven sheath, can be important in determining the geoeffectiveness of a CME. We take an existing arrival time model that includes expansion and deformation of the CME flux rope (ANTEATR; Kay & Gopalswamy, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025780; Kay & Nieves-Chinchilla, 2021a, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JA028911) and add a pileup procedure (PUP) as a physics-based approach to modeling the CME-driven sheath. ANTEATR-PUP solves the Rankine-Hugoniot equations for an oblique shock to determine the shock speed and sheath density, magnetic field, and temperature. The extra sheath mass affects the background drag calculation. Additionally, ANTEATR can now use any 1D profile for the background solar wind as opposed to the simple empirical models it previously relied upon. We present initial results from ANTEATR-PUP and compare with previous ANTEATR findings. Using results from an MHD simulation, we explore the effects of interactions with a static high-speed stream (HSS) on the CME's and sheath's interplanetary evolution. The drag forces essentially disappear while a CME remains within the HSS, but reappear stronger once the CME exits. The HSS-CME interaction produces the largest changes in the CME and sheath properties at 1 au when it occurs either close to the Sun near the inner simulation boundary at 0.1 au or right before the CME reaches 1 au. We estimate that these changes could significantly affect the geoeffectiveness."

Aerosol and cloud properties were measured with instruments on board the NASA LaRC Falcon HU-25 during the ACTIVATE (Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment) mission in summer (August) and winter (February–March) 2020. The data are grouped into different  loadings, and the density functions of NC and w near the cloud bases are compared. For low updrafts (w < 1.3 m s−1), NC in winter is mainly limited by the updraft speed and in summer additionally by aerosols. At larger updrafts (w > 3 m s−1), NC is impacted by the aerosol population, while at clean marine conditions cloud nucleation is aerosol-limited, and for high  it is influenced by aerosols and updraft. The aerosol size distribution in winter shows a bimodal distribution in clean marine environments, which transforms to a unimodal distribution in high  due to chemical and physical aerosol processes, whereas unimodal distributions prevail in summer, with a significant difference in their aerosol concentration and composition. The increase of  is accompanied with an increase of organic aerosol and sulfate compounds in both seasons. We demonstrate that NC can be explained by cloud condensation nuclei activation through upwards processed air masses with varying fractions of activated aerosols. The activation highly depends on w and thus supersaturation between the different seasons, while the aerosol size distribution additionally affects NC within a season. Our results quantify the seasonal influence of w and  on NC and can be used to improve the representation of low marine clouds in models."

In the frame of Polstar, we have studied the capabilities these observatories would offer to gain information on the magnetic and plasma properties of the magnetospheres of hot stars, helping us test the fundamental hypothesis that magnetospheres should act to rapidly drain angular momentum, thereby spinning the star down, whilst simultaneously reducing the net mass-loss rate. Both effects are expected to lead to dramatic differences in the evolution of magnetic vs. non-magnetic stars."

The underlying coronal mass ejection (CME) originating from a quiescent filament region becomes a 440 km/s magnetic cloud (MC) at 1 au after ∼5 days. The prolonged CME acceleration (for ∼24 hr) coincides with the time profiles of the post-eruption arcade intensity and reconnected flux. Chen et al. (2019, https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab3f36) obtain a lower speed since they assumed that the CME does not accelerate after ∼12 hr. The presence of multiple coronal holes near the filament channel and the high-speed wind from them seem to have the combined effect of producing complex rotation in the corona and IP medium resulting in a high-inclination MC. The Dst time profile in the main phase steepens significantly (rapid increase in storm intensity) coincident with the density increase (prominence material) in the second half of the MC. Simulations using the Comprehensive Inner Magnetosphere-Ionosphere model show that a higher ring current energy results from larger dynamic pressure (density) in MCs. Furthermore, the Dst index is highly correlated with the main-phase time integral of the ring current injection that includes density, consistent with the simulations. A complex temporal structure develops in the storm main phase if the underlying MC has a complex density structure during intervals of southward IP magnetic field. We conclude that the high intensity of the storm results from the prolonged CME acceleration, complex rotation of the CME flux rope, and the high density in the 1-au MC."

Using a novel, structure-guided sequence analysis of proteins, we explored the patterns of evolution of enzymes responsible for these reactions. Our analysis reveals that the folds that bind transition metal–containing ligands have similar structural geometry and amino acid sequences across the full diversity of proteins. Similarity across folds reflects the availability of key transition metals over geological time and strongly suggests that transition metal–ligand binding had a small number of common peptide origins. We observe that structures central to our similarity network come primarily from oxidoreductases, suggesting that ancestral peptides may have also facilitated electron transfer reactions. Last, our results reveal that the earliest biologically functional peptides were likely available before the assembly of fully functional protein domains over 3.8 billion years ago.

Thus, life is a special, very complex form of motion of matter, but this form did not always exist, and it is not separated from inorganic nature by an impassable abyss; rather, it arose from inorganic nature as a new property in the process of evolution of the world. We must study the history of this evolution if we want to solve the problem of the origin of life."

Etna Eruption Using Time-Series Interferometry and Magma Modeling for Hazard Zone Mapping,"Mount Etna has erupted several times since it was first formed. Recently, Mount Etna began erupting again over 24–27 December 2018. Because it erupts frequently, Mount Etna should be observed on a frequent basis. From June 2018 to October 2019, 34 and 56 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images were acquired from the ascending and descending tracks of the Sentinel-1 satellite, respectively. We employed the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) and a refined small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR method to produce a surface deformation time-series map. In the time-series analysis, the phase signal remained unaltered with time. The Okada model was then applied to the result to generate a modeled interferogram, and the Q-LavHA program was run to generate a lava flow prediction model. A direct comparison of the results showed that Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI)-StaMPS and the refined SBAS technique were comparable in terms of the displacement pattern, with slightly different velocity values obtained for individual points. In particular, a velocity range of −25 to 21 cm/yr was obtained from PSI-StaMPS, whereas a range of −30 to 25 cm/yr was obtained from the refined SBAS method. Upon computation of the vertical and east-west displacement components based on ascending and descending track data using both methods, deformation velocities of 51.5 and 52.5 cm/yr in the westerly direction on the western flank of Mount Etna were obtained from PSI-StaMPS and the refined SBAS method, respectively, whereas on the eastern flank, deformation toward the east was estimated to occur at a velocity of 50.1 or 54.2 cm/yr, respectively. PSIStaMPS estimated a vertical deformation velocity of −5.3 to 18.3 cm/yr, whereas the refined SBAS method produced a velocity range of approximately −7 to 19 cm/yr. The interferogram obtained via Okada modeling showed two fault sources in the 2018 Mount Etna eruption and a total volume change of approximately 12.39 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>. From the modeling results, a lava flow prediction model was generated using the Q-LavHA program. The approaches described in this study can be used by government officials, authorities, and other decision-makers to monitor and assess the risk of volcanic activity in the region."

A signal diagnostic of CMEs on the Sun is coronal dimming: a drop in coronal emission, tied to the mass of the CME, that is the direct result of removing emitting plasma from the corona. We present the results of a coronal dimming analysis of Fe XII 1349 Å and Fe XXI 1354 Å emission from <b><i>ϵ</b></i> Eridani ( <b><i>ϵ</b></i> Eri), a young K2 dwarf, with archival far-ultraviolet observations by the Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. Following a flare in 2015 February, <b><i>ϵ</b></i> Eri's Fe XXI emission declined by 81 ± 5%. Although enticing, a scant 3.8 minutes of preflare observations allows for the possibility that the Fe XXI decline was the decay of an earlier, unseen flare. Dimming nondetections following each of three prominent flares constrain the possible mass of ejected Fe XII-emitting (1 MK) plasma to less than a few × 10<sup>15</sup> g. This implies that CMEs ejecting this much or more 1 MK plasma occur less than a few times per day on <b><i>ϵ</b></i> Eri. On the Sun, 10<sup>15</sup> g CMEs occur once every few days. For   Eri, the mass-loss rate due to CME-ejected 1 MK plasma could be < 0.6 <b>Ṁ</b><sub>Ꙩ</sub> well below the star's estimated 30 <b>Ṁ</b><sub>Ꙩ</sub> mass-loss rate (wind + CMEs). The order-of-magnitude formalism we developed for these mass estimates can be broadly applied to coronal dimming observations of any star."

While reduced flying capacity may intuitively translate to reduced fatigue risk by way of fewer flights and duty hours, the actual impact of the pandemic on pilot fatigue is unknown.
     Methods: We surveyed US commercial airline pilots in late 2020 (n = 669) and early 2021 (n = 156) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on schedules and fatigue during the pandemic. 
     Results: Overall, pilots reported reduced flight and duty hours compared to pre-pandemic. Average sleep on workdays was slightly shorter in late 2020 (6.88 h) and recovered to pre-pandemic levels in early 2021 (6.95 h). Similarly, the frequency of sleepiness on days off and in-flight increased in late 2020, with 54% of pilots reporting an increase in in-flight sleepiness, then returned to pre-pandemic levels in early 2021. The use of in-flight sleepiness countermeasures remained the same across assessed time points. Pilots highlighted several factors which impacted their sleep and job performance, including limited access to nutritional food during duty days and layovers, reduced access to exercise facilities during layovers, increased stress due to job insecurity and health concerns, increased distractions and workload, and changes to scheduling.
     Discussion: Despite a reduction in flights and duty days, COVID-19 led to increased sleepiness on days off and in-flight, potentially due to the negative impact of lack of access to essential needs and heightened stress on sleep. Operators need to monitor the change in these COVID-19 related risks as the industry returns to full service."

Orbiting spectrometers are built according to multiple design parameters, including ground sampling distance (GSD), spectral resolution, temporal resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Different applications drive divergent instrument designs, so optimization for wide-reaching missions is complex. The Surface Biology and Geology component of NASA's Earth System Observatory addresses science questions and meets applications needs across diverse fields, including terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, natural disasters, and the cryosphere. The algorithms required to generate the geophysical variables from the observed spectral imagery each have their own inherent dependencies and sensitivities, and weighting these objectively is challenging. Here, we introduce intrinsic dimensionality (ID), a measure of information content, as an applications-agnostic, data-driven metric to quantify performance sensitivity to various design parameters. ID is computed through the analysis of the eigenvalues of the image covariance matrix, and can be thought of as the number of significant principal components. This metric is extremely powerful for quantifying the information content in high-dimensional data, such as spectrally resolved radiances and their changes over space and time. We find that the ID decreases for coarser GSD, decreased spectral resolution and range, less frequent acquisitions, and lower signal-to-noise levels. This decrease in information content has implications for all derived products. ID is simple to compute, providing a single quantitative standard to evaluate combinations of design parameters, irrespective of higher-level algorithms, products, applications, or disciplines."

Here, we introduced a novel framework to explore the 3-D structure of the evolution of droughts based on network theory concepts. The proposed framework is applied to identify critical source regions responsible for large-scale drought onsets during 1901–2014 for the North American continent using the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI). We built a spatial network connecting the drought onset timings for the North American continent. Using a spatially weighted network partitioning algorithm, the whole continent is then classified into regional spatial drought networks (RSN), where droughts are more likely to propagate within these regional systems. Finally, a customized network metric was applied to identify locations (source regions) where the drought onsets further propagate to other areas within the regional spatial network. Our results indicated that the West coast, Texas coastal region, and Southeastern Arkansas as major source regions through which atmospheric drought propagates to Western, South Central, and Eastern North America. The formation of drought source regions are due to presence of high pressure ridges and anomalous wind patterns. Furthermore, our results indicate that the drought propagation from these source regions may be due to inadequate moisture transport. The proposed framework can help to develop an early warning detection system for droughts and other spatially extensive extreme events such as heatwaves and floods."

This planet was discovered around a solar-metallicity M dwarf, using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry and confirmed with precise radial velocities from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID. With a planetary radius of 12.0 (+0.4 -0.5) R<sub>⊕</sub> and mass of 85.3 (+8.8 -8.7)M<sub>⊕</sub>, not only does this object add to the small sample of gas giants (∼10) around M dwarfs, but also its low density (ρ=0.27 <sup>+0.05</sup><sub style='position: relative; left:-2.5em;'>-0.04</sub>g) provides an opportunity to test theories of planet formation. We present two hypotheses to explain its low density; first, we posit that the low metallicity of its stellar host (∼0.3 dex lower than the median metallicity of M dwarfs hosting gas giants) could have played a role in the delayed formation of a solid core massive enough to initiate runaway accretion. Second, using the eccentricity estimate of 0.14 ± 0.06, we determine it is also plausible for tidal heating to at least partially be responsible for inflating the radius of TOI-3757b b. The low density and large scale height of TOI-3757 b makes it an excellent target for transmission spectroscopy studies of atmospheric escape and composition (transmission spectroscopy measurement of ∼ 190). We use HPF to perform transmission spectroscopy of TOI-3757 b using the helium 10830 Å line. Doing this, we place an upper limit of 6.9% (with 90% confidence) on the maximum depth of the absorption from the metastable transition of He at ∼10830 Å, which can help constraint the atmospheric mass-loss rate in this energy-limited regime."

In our previous study based on analyzing PR measurements, we found that attenuation-free surface backscattering cross sections (denoted by s0e) over land increased in the presence of precipitation. This behavior, called the soil moisture effect, causes an underestimate of the PIA by the SRT as the method does not explicitly consider this effect. In this study, measurements made by Ku-band Precipitation Radar (KuPR) and Ka-band Precipitation Radar (KaPR), which comprise the DPR, were analyzed to examine whether KuPR and KaPR exhibit similar dependencies on the soil moisture as does the PR. For both KuPR and KaPR, an increase in s0e was observed for a large portion of the land area, except for forests and deserts. Results from the Hitschfeld–Bordan (HB) method suggest that s0e increases with the surface precipitation rate for light precipitation events. Meanwhile, for heavy precipitation, owing to the degradation of the HB method, it is difficult to estimate s0e quantitatively. Thus, a correction method for PIA that considers the soil moisture effect was developed and implemented into the DPR standard algorithm. With this correction, the surface precipitation rate estimates increased by approximately 18%for KuPR and 15%for the normal scan of KaPR over land."

We used an island-wide sample of airborne lidar from the NASA Goddard Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager collected on March 2017, forest inventory data, and data on forest age, precipitation, soils, and land use to estimate aboveground biomass stocks in moist and wet, second-growth tropical forests. Biomass accumulation rates in Puerto Rico were lower, on average, than in other Neotropical forests. Median biomass across >16,700 ha of older second-growth forests was 105 Mg ha−1, and sampled biomass rarely surpassed 250 Mg ha−1. Differences in biomass by age were large and persistent across different substrates and land uses, with a plateau in the pattern of island-wide biomass accumulation after about 33 years. A spatial regression model showed that multiple factors were related to biomass accumulation, including time since abandonment, geologic substrate, past land use as coffee or pasture, precipitation, topographic wetness index, and slope. Our findings have important consequences for the total carbon storage and expected climate mitigation benefits of large-scale reforestation efforts, and highlight the value of airborne lidar for quantifying biomass variability in complex tropical landscapes."

Such analysis often requires spacecraft telemetry to first be transformed into derived fields and aggregated statistics before operators can begin their analysis. In past missions, aspects of this process have been automated, but operators were expected to use their own tools and procedures to understand and visualize the data, which led to redundant and inconsistent tools and processes. The Mech Data Tools Python library (MDT) was developed to provide a flexible, unified tool set for operators to extract and analyze mechanism telemetry over the life of the Mars 2020 surface mission. MDT consists of a set of configurable components that implement standard interfaces for ingesting input and producing output. Components can be chained together to form a data processing pipeline. Data are ingested from several sources within the greater Mars 2020 cloud infrastructure and stored in pandas DataFrames, which allows users to leverage the data manipulation capabilities present within the widely-used pandas library. Visualization capabilities are provided through the Plotly library, which generates interactive plots for users to interpret. Following the beginning of Mars 2020 surface operations, usage of MDT has spread to all mechanism-focused subsystems and has demonstrated great utility in analyzing early surface activities. This paper describes MDT’s evolution from heritage mechanism telemetry tools, the critical architecture decisions and challenges faced over MDT’s two years of development, and current applications of MDT in support of mechanism operations."

The ability to assess the navigation performance of these new and existing technologies is critical to identifying areas of risk reduction and investment. To that end, the Safe and Precise Landing Integrated Capabilities Evolution (SPLICE) project has demonstrated that a detailed six degree-of-freedom integrated performance simulation framework can provide information on and assessment of expected navigation performance. This framework incorporates engineering models of the on-board spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control systems at varying levels of fidelity. Recent advances in the development of this integrated performance simulation permit running these systems “in-the-loop,” rather than assuming perfect knowledge of the spacecraft states. This development, coupled with fast simulation time and modularization of the various system models, enables a wide variety of system trades to be assessed at once. This paper presents a summary of the advances in the SPLICE simulation framework, updates to the spacecraft navigation models, and an application of the framework to characterize the precision landing performance of a human-scale lunar lander. A series of trade studies examining effects of ground state update qualities shows that given all other assumptions, sufficiently accurate Deep Space Network (DSN) measurements can enable safe and precise human-scale Lunar landings."

Due to the criticality of the EDL sequence, redundant telecommunications strategies were utilized to observe the event. The rover transmitted an X-band (8.4 GHz) signal encoded with Multiple Frequency Shift Keying tones direct-to-Earth and a UHF (401.5 MHz) signal with 8 kbps encoded telemetry to orbiters, which relayed the signal back to Earth at X-band. NASA’s Deep Space Network complexes at Goldstone, California and Madrid, Spain received the direct-to-Earth X-band signal. Two of the largest steerable radio telescopes in the world, the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia and the Effelsberg 100-meter Radio Telescope in Germany also received the UHF carrier signal on Earth. During the EDL event, full spectrum recordings of the UHF and X-band signals were captured at these observatories using open-loop receivers. Real-time and post-processing signal analysis to determine power level, received frequency, and Doppler shift allowed determination of the spacecraft’s health and safety state during critical sequences, including event detection such as atmospheric entry, plasma blackouts, and parachute deployment. Simultaneous observations of the UHF and X-band radio links allow for redundancy in the event of a fault and greatly improve confidence in Doppler event detection."

Various communicationsystems on the lander or rover could be used for the Earthto-Moon communication in both the uplink and downlink direction.To communicate to and from the lander/rover on the lunarSouth Pole, low and/or medium directional antennas onboardthe lander/rover will have to be pointed at low elevation anglesbetween 2 to 10 degrees, thus causing multipath fading effectsdue to reflection of a portion of the transmitted electromagneticwaves from the surface of the Moon. These are not commonlyencountered in traditional deep space communications betweena spacecraft and a ground station.We investigate various design methods and analyze such communicationsystems, in the presence of multipath fading. Wemodel the fading channel based on existing and simulated data.For coherent reception, the acquisition and tracking loop shouldacquire and track incoming carrier phase in presence of Ricianmultipath fading. For this communication system in additionto estimating the received carrier phase, the amplitude of thefading signal should also be estimated, in particular to be used inthe decoder. We consider simple modulation and coding schemesin particular those specified in the CCSDS standards for spaceapplications.After designing various components of the communication system,we use Simulink models to obtain the end-to-end performanceof the communication link under investigation. Basedon the available data, the fading channel can be accuratelymodeled as a Rician fading channel with various Rician parametersdepending on the Earth elevation angle, which alsoaffects the Doppler spread. Therefore, the challenge is todesign a communication system robust in the presence of themultipath fading where the channel conditions change in timeand thus produce fading. In summary, this paper comparespossible communication system designs, performance analysis,and simulations for coded system with/without interleaving withhard/soft decision and with/without channel state information(CSI), over a communication link between a lander/rover at theLunar south pole and a Deep Space Network station in presenceof Rician fading."

Prime examples of such missions include Aerobots (such as Ingenuity with extremely low SWaP constraints and demanding signal/image processing during flight) and landers in possibly hostile environments (such as a Europa lander mission, with limited communication capacity, high latency, and constrained power budget). To address these challenges, JPL worked with Qualcomm to demonstrate the use of their Snapdragon 801 system-on-chip (SoC) onboard the Ingenuity Helicopter on Mars. The Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC contains various subsystems, including an ARM cluster, a Graphics processing unit, a Digital Signal Processing subsystem, a Neural Processing Engine, Image Signal Processing subsystem, among others. Since the success of Ingenuity, JPL is continuing to work with Qualcomm to address other applications of the Snapdragon SoC technology. This includes the deployment of two 855 Snapdragon development boards onboard the International Space Station (ISS) for successful in-situ benchmarking of applications in space (beyond those tested on Ingenuity). In this paper, we will examine the performance of various applications that have been identified to benefit from greater onboard computational capability. These applications include (among others): machine vision algorithms that are expected to be critical in autonomous entry-descent-and-landing scenarios and real-time Aerobot flight navigation; Hyperspectral compression algorithms; Synthetic Aperture Radar Processing along with various instrument processing algorithms. We discuss how the infusion of Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoC is capable of enabling missions that may not have been able to achieve their goals with traditional flight computing. In addition, we also show that for some algorithms, the software implementation on the Snapdragon SoC outperforms traditional FPGA implementations."

The team uses a complex suite of software tools to accomplish this challenging task in time for the next window of opportunity to send commands to the rover. A key piece of this software ecosystem is COCPIT (Component-based Campaign Planning, Implementation, and Tactical). COCPIT is part of the next generation of planning and scheduling software tools developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in partnership with NASA's Ames Research Center. COCPIT is a web-based application that allows users to collaboratively view and update the Perseverance rover's activity plans, continuously verify that the plan satisfies constraints, assign targets for directing scientific instruments, document science intent, and model power and data resources. Mars Surface Operations requires diverse expertise from team members within the Engineering, Science, Robotic, and Instrument Operations groups, distributed across North America and Europe. In order to improve efficiency and reduce risk, all teams are able to review and edit their activities simultaneously and see the effects on the plan in its entirety. As part of the Ground Data System (GDS) tool suite, COCPIT is responsible for the activity plan. It provides specialized views that allow operators to understand where there may be room for additional observations, see whether any planning constraints are being violated, and confirm that energy usage and data generation are within the defined limits. It contains details such as which filters a camera will use for a given observation, what the resolution of the images should be, where to store the data onboard, and how long the observation is expected to take. It predicts when specific data will be downlinked from the rover to a passing orbiter, so that the team knows when to expect that data on Earth for evaluation in future planning. Ultimately the information from the COCPIT plan is translated to sequences that will be bundled and radiated to Perseverance for execution. The COCPIT tool is used throughout all planning phases."

Estimating the probabilitythat these mission concepts will fit within the small cost capsof these opportunities is largely driven by the probability thatone of the burgeoning number of small satellite providers will beable to meet the payload’s accommodation requirements withinthe budget for the spacecraft. JPL has collected a databasecontaining technical specifications and cost of commerciallyavailable Smallsat buses across various vendors. The primarypurpose of the database is for use in JPL’s Team X architecturestudies to inform cost estimates of a spacecraft bus which fitsthe customer’s technical requirements for their payload andmission. Customer needs are often unique and don’t alignperfectly with an off-the-shelf commercial spacecraft bus, whichmotivates the need to develop a cost model across the continuoustechnical parameter space.Al’s Bus Cost Distribution Estimator (ABCDE) uses Gaussianprocess regression (GPR) to predict commercial Smallsat spacecraftbus cost based on a subset of a customer’s technicalrequirements (payload mass, payload power, delta V, pointingcontrol, and downlink rate). GPR is implemented in ABCDE asa Bayesian method which fits an implied multivariate regressionon the technical parameters and uses kriging to intentionally“overfit” the residuals. Overfitting the residuals allows costestimates to collapse in uncertainty closer to the data pointswhile maintaining larger uncertainty intervals in regions of parameterspace with fewer data records. The data used to fit thismodel is sensitive and represents cost estimates for off-the-shelfcommercial buses. GPR simultaneously protects the sensitivityof the database and uses the sparse nature of the database toaccount for uncertainty in cost in a useful way. For a givenset of customer technical requirements, the tool provides a costestimate distribution, the percentiles of which can be interpretedas a confidence level of finding a commercial bus under a specifiedcost cap. ABCDE dramatically pushes the boundaries ofspacecraft cost estimation models due to its Bayesian methodology(accounting for the maximum uncertainty in the underlyingregression), the mathematically advanced kriging methodology,and the novelty of its application in Team X architecture tradestudies."

Well publicized examples of high profile new developments include precision landing, the sampling and caching system, the specific instrument suite, improved mobility via Autonomous Navigation, and later the addition of the Ingenuity helicopter. Less well known are the refinements to the core flight infrastructure, primarily in the cross-cutting functions of Telecom, Avionics, Data Management, Communications Behaviors, and Parameter Management. These enhancements are introduced predominately via flight software, and represent increases in capability that justified their inclusion in an otherwise heritage-focused project environment.Perseverance’s cross-cutting flight infrastructure improvements fall into and across the following five categories. First is a trimming of the software footprint of infrastructure modules, in order to make room for memory demands elsewhere in the system. Second is the minimization of data volume to be downlinked, through various methods such as the incorporation of new compression options. Third is the maximization of the available downlink bandwidth for data, by curtailing content-less data (fill) and introducing an improved UHF proximity link protocol. Fourth is a reduction in vulnerabilities, through increased file system redundancy, robustness, and software process monitoring. Fifth is an increase in operations efficiency by lowering file system mount times, improving parallelism between simultaneous events, minimizing the time to recover from file system errors, streamlining the purging of obsolete data, and reducing the number of commands to service parameters by a factor of 100.Individually, none of the cross-cutting infrastructure improvements are likely to garner headlines, but collectively they appreciably improve the safety and operability of Perseverance over its predecessor. This paper will describe the improvements, their promise, and where applicable, their actual impact in operations."

It uses a jetpack to slow down a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH) after separation from the backshell, and reach aerodynamic conditions suitable for helicopter take-off in mid air. MAHD's lander-free approach leaves enough room in the aeroshell to accommodate larger rotors. This drastically improves flight performance compared to heritage EDL approaches, notably +60\% science payload mass. MAHD also brings cost savings, a simpler architecture, improved surface access and can reach higher elevations on Mars. This paper introduces a design for the MAHD system architecture and operations. We present a mechanical configuration which fits both MSH and the jetpack within the 2.65-m Mars heritage aeroshell, and a jetpack control architecture which fully leverages the available helicopter avionics. We discuss preliminary numerical models of the flow dynamics resulting from the interaction between the jets, the rotors and the side winds. We define a force-torque sensing architecture capable of handling the wind and trimming the rotors to prepare for safe take-off. Finally, we analyze the dynamic environment and closed-loop control simulation results to demonstrate the preliminary feasibility of MAHD."

However, the depth to a potential subsurface aquifer may be kilometers deep, which is well beyond what current surface or orbital approaches can survey while also confirming the unique signature for liquid water. Inspired by critical technology for exploring deep aquifers on Earth, we are developing the Transient H2O Reconnaissance (TH2OR) instrument at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). TH2OR operates on the principle of transient electromagnetics (TEM), which leverages induction and electromotive force to induce a current in a subsurface water body using a loop-shaped antenna that provides both transmit and receive functions when placed on the surface. On Mars, TEM may be even more effective given the relative dryness of the subsurface compared to a more conductive, saline, liquid, water body on Earth. However, to probe deep within the subsurface (below 5 km) a large enclosed antenna is needed – specifically, a 100-m diameter effective loop or a shape with roughly equivalent area that can transmit at low frequencies (kHz-Hz). The deployment of a large-scale structure on the surface is complicated by the fact that the transmit wire must be both lightweight and robust to contact with the surface. Further, TH2OR may be delivered to the surface by a non-mobile vehicle, so it is desired that the deployment can be activated from a static location. This paper provides an overview of the deployment trade study, focusing on our current, favored approach, using a projectile wire launcher. Building on past approaches in the literature, we have developed and fielded an Earth-based, gas-projectile prototype for launching a triangle-shaped antenna onto analogue terrain. Our results compare simulated launch performance to actual field tests conducted under Earth gravity and pressure conditions. We discuss how Earth performance maps to a prospective Mars deployment under reduced gravity and pressure. We also provide lessons learned and next steps towards the development of an integrated TH2OR instrument for finding water on Mars."

While the Perseverance rover was based on the Curiosity rover which landed in 2012, the Robotic Arm was redesigned to carry a much larger turret with a new suite of payloads. Shortly after Perseverance landed in Jezero Crater, a series of checkouts was completed with the RA during the first 100 sols of the mission in order to ensure proper functionality of the RA and the instruments mounted on the turret. This period of time in the mission was called Surface Operations Transition (SOX). The objective of SOX was to systematically execute checkout activities for all the basic functionality so that the RA and instruments, as well as other rover components, could be released for scientific exploration.RA activities during SOX can be divided into a few different categories: Mechanism Checkouts, Rover Visual Inspections, Performance Characterization, and Instrument Functional Checkouts. Many of these checkouts built off of each other such that each subsequent activity would verify incrementally complex functionality. Many of the defined activities were executed several times throughout the development of the rover and served as a check that the RA’s performance is consistent with testing on Earth. Other activities were developed uniquely for SOX to respond to challenges discovered during development. They were designed to be verifiable without the help of ground support equipment or previous executions on the flight hardware to compare against.This paper discusses the formulation and conception of the various RA SOX checkout activities, verification and testing required to certify them for flight, execution of the activities on Mars, issues encountered, and finally results and findings as the mission transitioned to nominal science operations. We will be presenting the results and analysis using downlinked imaging and data from the flight vehicle to show how we verified the performance of the Robotic Arm and the turret mounted instruments in order to transition to science operations with a clean bill of health."

The Operational Perseverance Twin for the Integration of Mechanisms and Instruments Sent to Mars, or OPTIMISM, is the Mars 2020 Vehicle System Testbed (VSTB) rover operated by NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California. OPTIMISM’s home is the JPL Mars Yard; an outdoor field with red soil that simulates the terrain encountered by Perseverance. The VSTB is a full-scale engineering model of the flight rover, serving a number of functions to ensure mission operations can continue smoothly and on schedule. The VSTB possesses instrumentation, computers, mechanisms, cameras, and a Mobility subsystem that are nearly identical to its extraterrestrial twin. Its high fidelity allows the rover to be a highly effective tool to fully test system functionality and performance prior to commanding the flight rover.  The early stages of building OPTIMISM began a few months prior to Perseverance departing JPL for Cape Canaveral, FL in early 2020. Electrical integration of the flight system avionics, and compatibility checkouts of the electrical ground support equipment ensured that the foundation of the electrical system was operational and in place. Next, the internal harnessing was installed and compatibility checks of the rover instrumentation and mechanisms were performed to confirm the system was prepared for full buildup. Finally, mechanical assembly of the rover chassis with its external components completed the integration of the system before it was moved to the Mars Yard for its initial phase of testing to perform verification & validation (V&V) of the Mobility subsystem requirements.  By the time Perseverance landed at Jezero Crater in February 2021, the first phase of VSTB operations was underway. Surface guidance, navigation, and control (SGNC) testing for the Mobility subsystem ensured functionality and performance requirements were met for various capabilities such as visual odometry (VO), mapping, and automatic navigation (AutoNav). Subsequent integration of the robotic arm (RA) onto the VSTB enabled the V&V campaign for surface sampling operations (SSO) to commence. As the mission’s engineering operations (EO) have gotten underway, the VSTB has been utilized for an array of purposes including troubleshooting software anomalies, and performing dry-runs for first time activities (FTAs) prior to sending the commands to Perseverance. OPTIMISM will continue to serve mission critical functions as long as Perseverance is roving the Red Planet."

Less than seven months later, the Perseverance rover touched down safely in Jezero Crater to begin its ambitious mission that includes looking for signs of ancient life and collecting samples for future return to Earth. Getting to the successful landing, or “Tango Delta Nominal,” could not have been achieved without also considering the off-nominal. One of the teams supporting this ambitious mission is the fault protection (FP) team. This team is tasked with assessing the various failures, or faults, that could prevent mission success and with ensuring that the autonomous behaviors built into the software and hardware can detect faults and recover the vehicle to a safe state. As part of its charter, the FP team designed a test campaign to provide confidence in the system’s robustness to off-nominal scenarios across all of Mars 2020’s mission phases. The greatest challenge associated with designing such a validation campaign was reducing the infinite number of anomalous scenarios into a finite test suite. In addition, the tests needed to be executed efficiently in order to utilize the team’s limited test venue access, but still needed to maintain a level of rigor that guaranteed confidence in the test outcomes. Given that each test scenario generated massive amounts of data, the team also developed methods for quickly ascertaining whether the autonomous fault protection behaviors maintained vehicle safety in the presence of an anomaly. This paper summarizes the processes that the Mars 2020 fault protection team employed to execute its off-nominal validation campaign. It captures both the methods of generating a suite of off-nominal tests, as well as reducing it to a subset that can be realistically executed within schedule and resource constraints. It also describes the various processes and philosophies that the team utilized to execute the tests efficiently, including creating a standardized procedure template, keeping the test cases modular so that they could be easily interchanged, and capturing common fault injections in a change-controlled database. Finally, it will describe the tools and processes for assessing the test data, focusing in particular on a tool that evaluated vehicle state using “secondary” sources of data to validate that the software had truly configured the spacecraft to the expected safe state."

Tour durations, flyby altitudes, propellant budgets, power consumption, and other metrics are essential to developing and managing NASA missions. But beyond the simple metrics of cost and workforce, it has been difficult to identify objective, quantitative measures that assist in evaluating choices made during formulation or implementation phases in terms of their impact on flight operations. As part of the development of the Europa Clipper Mission system, a set of operations metrics have been defined along with the necessary design information and software tooling to calculate them. We have applied these methods and metrics to help assess the impact to the flight team on the six options for the Clipper Tour that are currently being vetted for selection in the fall of 2021. To generate these metrics, the Clipper MOS team first designed the set of essential processes by which flight operations will be conducted, using a standard approach and template to identify (among other aspects) timelines for each process, along with their time constraints (e.g., uplinks for sequence execution). Each of the resulting 50 processes is documented in a common format and concurred by stakeholders. Process timelines were converted into generic schedules and workforce-loaded using COTS scheduling software, based on the inputs of the process authors and domain experts. Custom code was generated to create an operations schedule for a specific portion of Clipper's prime mission, with instances of a given process scheduled based on specific timing rules (e.g., process X starts once per week on Thursdays) or relative to mission events (e.g., sequence generation process begins on a Monday, at least three weeks before each Europa closest approach). Over a 5-month period, and for each of six Clipper candidate tours, the result was a 20,000+ line, workforce-loaded schedule that documents all of the process-driven work effort at the level of individual roles, along with a significant portion of the level-of-effort work. Post-processing code calculated the absolute and relative number of work hours during a nominal 5 day / 40 hour work week, the work effort during 2nd and 3rd shift, as well as 1st shift on weekends. The resultant schedules and shift tables were used to generate objective measures that can be related to both human factors and to operational risk and showed that Clipper tours which utilize 6:1 resonant (21.25 day) orbits instead of 4:1 resonant (14.17 day) orbits during the first dozen or so Europa flybys are advantageous to flight operations. A similar approach can be extended to assist missions in more objective assessments of a number of mission issues and trades, including tour selection and spacecraft design for operability."

Recent Lyman-alpha (Lyα) studies during the epochof reionization show growing evidence that ionized bubbles formed earlier around brighter galaxies, suggest-ing higher IGM transmission of Lyαfrom these galaxies.  We investigate this problem using IR slitless spec-troscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G102 grism observations of148 galaxies selected via photometric redshifts at6.0< z <8.2.  These galaxies have spectra extracted fromthe CANDELS LyαEmission at Reionization (CLEAR) survey. We combine the CLEAR data for 275 galaxieswith the Keck/DEIMOS+MOSFIRE dataset from the Texas Spectroscopic Search for LyαEmission at the Endof Reionization Survey. We then constrain the Lyαequivalent-width (EW) distribution at6.0< z <8.2, whichis described by an exponential form,dN/dEW∝exp(-EW)/W0, with the characteristice-folding scale width(W0). We confirm a significant drop of the Lyαstrength (orW0) atz >6. Furthermore, we compare the redshiftevolution ofW0between galaxies at different UV luminosities.  The UV-bright (MUV<−21, orLUV> L∗)galaxies show weaker evolution with a decrease of 0.4 (±0.2) dex inW0atz >6while UV-faint (MUV>−21,orLUV< L∗) galaxies exhibit a significant drop by a factor of 0.7-0.8 (±0.2) dex inW0fromz <6toz >6.Our results add to the accumulating evidence that UV-bright galaxies exhibit boosted Lyαtransmission in theIGM, suggesting that reionization completes sooner in regions proximate to galaxies of higher UV luminosity."

One of the five targets (OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 or OB110462 for short) shows a significant >1 mas coherent astrometric shift, little to no lens flux, and has an inferred lens mass of 1.6–4.4 M<sub>⨀</sub>. This makes OB110462 the first definitive discovery of a compact object through astrometric microlensing and it is most likely either a neutron star or a low-mass black hole. This compact-object lens is relatively nearby (0.70–1.92 kpc) and has a slow transverse motion of <30 kms<sup>-1</sup>. OB110462 shows significant tension between models well fit to photometry versus astrometry, making it currently difficult to distinguish between a neutron star and a black hole. Additional observations and modeling with more complex system geometries, such as binary sources, are needed to resolve the puzzling nature of this object. For the remaining four candidates, the lens masses are <2M<sub>⨀</sub>, and they are unlikely to be black holes; two of the four are likely white dwarfs or neutron stars. We compare the full sample of five candidates to theoretical expectations on the number of black holes in the Milky Way (∼10<sup>8</sup> ) and find reasonable agreement given the small sample size."

The control algorithm consists of an adaptive controller combined with feedback linearization. When a spacecraft makes contact with the surface, it must maintain a desired contact force in order to capture a sample.

The adaptive controller performs system identification online to create an input-output model of the feedback linearized system.

These challenges motivate an integrated approach to planning and execution that is able to respond intelligently to variation. We examine this problem in the context of the Europa Lander mission concept, and propose a planning and execution framework that responds to feedback and task failure using two techniques: flexible execution and replanning with plan optimization. We develop a theoretical framework to predict the value of each of these techniques, and we compare these predictions to empirical results generated in simulation. We demonstrate that an integrated approach to planning and execution that is grounded in flexible execution, replanning, and utility maximization will be an enabling technology for future tightly-constrained planetary surface missions."

The proposed algorithm uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to combine an IMU propagated state estimate with batch correction estimates computed over a sliding window of measurements. The batch correction algorithm follows the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach used in other Bundle Adjustment systems. Unlike other systems, the proposed system parameterizes the state over the entire window in terms of the state at a single epoch. By ignoring IMU error over the window duration, we obtain a state epoch MLE that jointly estimates the epoch state and terrain parameters with drastically reduced computationally cost. This paper presents the general architecture which can be adapted for various state parameterizations and measurement inputs. For space applications with high-accuracy IMUs, the reduction in computational cost comes with only a modest increase in estimation errors. The increase in error is quantified via a linear covariance analysis presented in this paper. Furthermore, we present simulation results which show the applicability of this algorithm to planetary landing problems."

Thus far these challenges have been met using the full arsenal of tools: formal methods, informal methods, testing, runtime techniques, and operations processes. Using examples from previous deployments of autonomy to the Remote Agent on DS-1, Autonomous Sciencecraft on EO-1, WATCH on MER, IPEX, AEGIS on MER, MSL, and M2020, and the M2020 Onboard planner, we discuss how each of these approaches have been used to enable successful deployment of autonomy. We next focus on relatively limited use of formal methods (both prior to deployment and runtime methods). From the needs perspective, formal methods represent the best chance for reliable autonomy as testing, informal methods, and operations accommodations do not scale well with increasing complexity of the autonomous system. However from the practice perspective, formal methods have been limited in their application due to difficulty in eliciting formal specifications and challenges in representing complex constraints such as metric time and resources.  We discuss some of these challenges as well as the opportunity to extend formal and informal methods into runtime validation systems."

In this paper, we focus on the dynamical behavior of deployable booms and the important challenge of avoiding collisions between boom’s structural elements or with other parts of the spacecraft, that can potentially have serious consequences. We define this kind of collisions as “transient instabilities” in deployable booms. A new paradigm to tackle these issues is presented in this paper, using techniques from multi-agent/swarm literature like transient instability prevention methods that avoid inter-agent collisions. We have adapted these techniques to deployable booms to guarantee safe deployment of booms and avoid collisions. We also present computational simulations of boom deployment in order to validate our techniques and demonstrate its use for future space missions."

Earlier studies have shown the complementary nature of multi-frequency microwave radiometer measurements to detect subsurface LWC distribution in addition to surface LWC, which is critical for understanding the seasonal melt dynamics of ice sheets. In this study, we used 1.4 GHz brightness temperature (TB) measurements from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, and 6.9, 10.7, 18.9, and 36.5 GHz TB measurements from the JAXA Global Change Observation Mission-Water Shizuku (GCOM-W) satellite to investigate the multi-frequency response at pan-Greenland scale.

The Mars mission vehicle would include a Mars transit habitat, an Orion spacecraft, and chemical propulsion stages. It would be launched by a combination of SLS and commercial rockets to be aggregated in high Earth orbit or at the Lunar Gateway. The crew would launch to the mission vehicle in Orion as the final element in the assembly. After transit to Mars, the crew would spend about 30 days in a high Mars orbit and then return to Earth via a Venus flyby and gravity assist. A sunshade would be deployed for thermal control of the mission vehicle inside 1 AU. The crew would return directly to Earth in the Orion crew module, with the transit habitat being expended.

The latest Martian terrain segmentation methods rely on supervised learning which is very data hungry and difficult to train where only a small number of labeled samples are available. Moreover, the semantic classes are defined differently for different applications (e.g., rover traversal vs. geological) and as a result the network has to be trained from scratch each time, which is an inefficient use of resources. This research proposes a semi-supervised learning framework for Mars terrain segmentation where a deep segmentation network trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled images is transferred to the task of terrain segmentation trained on few labeled images. The network incorporates a backbone module which is trained using a contrastive loss function and an output atrous convolution module which is trained using a pixel-wise cross-entropy loss function. Evaluation results using the metric of segmentation accuracy show that the proposed method with contrastive pre-training outperforms plain supervised learning by 2%-10%. Moreover, the proposed model is able to achieve a segmentation accuracy of 91.1% using only 161 training images (1% of the original dataset) compared to 81.9% with plain supervised learning."

The current NASA human Mars reference architecture assumes delivery of three 25 t payloads from a 1- or 5-Sol orbit to the surface with a landing precision of 50 m to ensure logistics are located near the habitat. While initial navigation estimates improve with on-orbit ground tracking, errors increase during post-deorbit coast. Likewise, Mars atmospheric variability and forecasting uncertainty means that the entry vehicle guidance, navigation, and control systems must be robust to accommodate landing during any time of day or Mars year, including during dust storms. Precision landing technologies are currently being assessed to determine if onboard navigation sensors are sufficient to enable the landing accuracy required or if additional navigation aids such as surface or orbiting beacons will be needed. This study evaluates the system performance requirements to meet the desired landing accuracy for the reference vehicle design and entry, descent, and landing concept of operations. A detailed six degree-of-freedom integrated performance simulation framework is used to perform the assessment and demonstrate that under current assumptions, onboard navigation sensors are sufficient to support precision landing."

The robustness of results to the choice of model and assimilation algorithm also warrants further study.  We investigate these issues using two Mars general circulation models (MGCMs), with particular emphasis on zonal wind and temperature fields. When temperature retrievals from the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) are assimilated into the U.K.-Laboratoire de M ́et ́eorologie Dynamique (UK-LMD) MGCM to create the Mars Analysis Correction Data Assimilation (MACDA) reanalysis, low-level zonal jets in the winter northern hemisphere shift equatorward and weaken relative to a free-running control simulation from the same MGCM. The Ensemble Mars Atmosphere Reanalysis System (EMARS) reanalysis, which is also based on TES temperature retrievals, also shows jet weakening (but less if any shifting) relative to a control simulation performed with the underlying Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) MGCM. Examining higher levels of the atmosphere, monthly mean three-dimensional temperature and zonal wind fields are in generally better agreement between the two reanalyses than between the two control simulations.  In conjunction with information about the MGCMs’ physical parametrizations, intercomparisons between the various reanalyses and control simulations suggest that overall the EMARS control run is plausibly less biased (relative to the true state of the Martian atmosphere) than the MACDA control run.  Implications for future observational studies are discussed.

Plain Language Summary 
An increasingly popular way to study Martian weather and climate is to combine atmospheric temperature observations with a computer model (specifically, a global climate model).  The process of combining model and observations is called “data assimilation”, and the resulting merged data set is called a “reanalysis”.  One advantage of reanalyses is that they include variables (such as wind) that are not directly observed.  For scientific and practical applications we want these variables to be reasonably accurate— however, it is not clear how well data assimilation algorithms compute them.  Our study investigates this issue using two Mars reanalyses and two model simulations that do not assimilate temperature data.  We focus on slowly-varying atmospheric phenomena (timescales from 10 Mars days to a season).  Assimilating temperature data into two different global climate models changes the strength and/or spatial pattern of east-west winds at low altitudes.  Furthermore, monthly mean three-dimensional temperature and east-west wind fields agree better between reanalyses than between non-assimilating model simulations. This suggests that the data assimilation process is basically successful.  One non-assimilating model simulation has less realistic representations of atmospheric physical processes than the other—we argue that this plausibly gives it larger biases relative to the true state of the atmosphere."

A comprehensive test matrix was established to determine if Motion Magnification (MM) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) can be used to determine the onset of FIV in straight and gimbaled bellows. Several of the tests were intended to determine if MM and DIC can establish the resonant frequencies of the bellows with no a priori knowledge. The results of the MM and DIC were compared with data from strain gages and microphones. Although the testing was limited to one single-ply unshielded bellows, this effort provided the proof-of-concept that MM and DIC are feasible methods for determining the onset of FIV in bellows."

However, quantification and understanding of groundwater extraction across scales have been hampered by inadequate water usage reporting and limited information on irrigation practices. Here we analyze observations from ∼15,000 groundwater monitoring wells and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites together with irrigation, agricultural, and meteorological datasets to show how drought-induced coupling between natural and anthropogenic groundwater storage variations has caused sustainability challenges in India, the world's biggest consumer of groundwater for irrigation. Notably, the mechanisms and consequences of such coupling differ significantly depending on aquifer types. In Andhra Pradesh's hard rock aquifer, groundwater declines have been limited, despite the nearly constant water scarcity that its farmers face. Moreover, its free farm power policy involves an annual irrigation energy consumption of 26 billion kWh that costs US$ 2.5 billion, possibly unparalleled compared to any other part of the world of similar size (0.27 million km2). In West Bengal's highly permeable alluvial aquifer, the water table is declining rapidly (15 cm/yr) due to a policy that encourages irrigation. Situated between these two states, Odisha's aquifer shows substantial resilience to drought, owing to the state's relatively natural landscape and forest restoration policy. The findings of this study provide new insights to understand the divergent aspects of groundwater irrigation in north versus south India, which can enable development of adaptation and mitigation strategies to avert the looming water crisis."

This wavelength range can warm and ionize terrestrial planets' upper atmospheres, which expands the planetary radius and promotes atmospheric loss. In this work, we study the contribution of the XUV flux due to flares on the atmospheric escape of Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs through numerical simulations. We considered the first Gyr of planets with initial surface water abundances between 1 and 10 terrestrial oceans (TO), a small primordial hydrogen envelope ( 10􀀀3 M), and with host star masses between 0.2 and 0.6 M. In this parameter range, we find that flares can remove up to two TO more than non flaring stars, which, in some cases, translates to a doubling of the total water loss. We also find that flaring can increase atmospheric oxygen partial pressures by hundreds of bars in some cases. These results were obtained by adding a new module for flares to the VPLanet software package and upgrading its atmospheric escape module to account for Roche lobe overflow and radiation/recombination-limited escape."

In addition to pressure gradient, the subsurface liquid in alkanofers is subject to vertical compositional grading due to the gravity and temperature gradient. The common wisdom is that the liquid would normally stay underground in a stability established by the pressure that increases with depth as observed in aquifers on Earth. However, Titan’s liquids consist of nitrogen and hydrocarbons, mainly methane and ethane, the behavior of which is very sensitive to temperature and pressure. Consequently, the liquid density does not always increase with depth, thus may introduce a reverse density profile that leads to vertical convective instability of the liquid column. If reverse density profiles are present, capillary pressures arising from liquid trapped within small pores in the crust can help with the column stability. The liquid held in the capillaries can seal the space below it thus helping with the stability, unless the overpressure built from underneath becomes larger than the capillary pressure, which causes leakage to allow the liquids to seep upward from the deep. This situation is analogous to hydrocarbon seeps on Earth, where oil and natural gas escape the reservoir and flow slowly through network of cracks to the surface. An algorithm based on an extended Gibbs equation commonly used in petroleum reservoir engineering is employed in this work to produce pressure, density, and compositional profiles for evaluating the stability and phase behavior of Titan’s subsurface fluids."

community noise surveys. Data from two NASA field surveys are used that consist of multiple responses
per survey participant. These data require an approach that accounts for the correlation among repeated
annoyance observations from the same participant. A multilevel model accounts for the correlation by
allowing estimated parameters to vary with each survey participant. On the other hand, a population
average model utilizes generalized estimating equations and accounts for the correlation via a userspecified
within-subject correlation structure. A visual comparison of the dose-response curves for these
two methods reveals similar results. When comparing specific points along the summary curves, the
multilevel model yields more precise confidence bounds than the population average model. The similarity
between the summary curves derived from each model lends validity to both approaches for approximating
a population representative summary curve, though modeling assumptions may lend favor to the multilevel
logistic modeling approach over the population average model."

The reduced-order method uses a rotor-disk model in the OVERFLOW CFD code and is an important aspect of this study. A rotor-trim option loosely coupling the Comprehensive code CAMRAD II with the OVERFLOW CFD code is included in the simulation that captures rotor blade aerodynamics, blade and rotor performance, rotor-rotor, and rotor-body interactions. Detailed comparison and validation were performed for both higher-fidelity full rotor unsteady flows and reduced-order rotor-disk methods. The tunnel geometry is included in the detailed computational effort. Computations of the low-Reynolds number flows were performed for a different number of in-plane rotors as well as for a single rotor modeled inside the tunnel."

Despite their importance, much uncertainty remains in the detection of atmospheric rivers in large datasets such as reanalyses and century scale climate simulations. To understand this uncertainty, the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) developed tiered experiments, including the Tier 2 Reanalysis Intercomparison that is presented here. Eleven detection algorithms submitted hourly tags--binary fields indicating the presence or absence of atmospheric rivers--of detected atmospheric rivers in the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' Reanalysis Version 5 (ERA5) as well as six-hourly tags in the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55). Due to a higher climatological mean for integrated water vapor transport in MERRA-2, atmospheric rivers were detected more frequently relative to the other two reanalyses, particularly in algorithms that use a fixed threshold for water vapor transport. The finer horizontal resolution of ERA5 resulted in narrower atmospheric rivers and an ability to detect atmospheric rivers along resolved coastlines. The fraction of hemispheric area covered by ARs varies throughout the year in all three reanalyses, with different atmospheric river detection tools having different seasonal cycles."

We present the most accurate spin ephemerides of the source so far: ν = 0.096008680(2) Hz,  $\dot{\n𝜈}=-6.2(1) x (10)^(-14) Hz/s, and significant second and third frequency derivative terms indicative of nonnegligible timing noise. The phase-averaged 0.8–7 keV spectrum is well fit with a double-blackbody (BB) model throughout the campaign. The BB temperatures remain constant at 0.46 and 1.2 keV. The areas and flux of each component decreased by a factor of 6, initially through a steep decay trend lasting about 46 days, followed by a shallow long-term one. The pulse shape in the same energy range is initially complex, exhibiting three distinct peaks, yet with clear continuous evolution throughout the outburst toward a simpler, single-pulse shape. The rms pulsed fraction is high and increases from about 40% to 50%. We find no dependence of pulse shape or fraction on energy. These results suggest that multiple hot spots, possibly possessing temperature gradients, emerged at outburst onset and shrank as the outburst decayed. We detect 84 faint bursts with NICER, having a strong preference for occurring close to the surface emission pulse maximum—the first time this phenomenon is detected in such a large burst sample. This likely implies a very low altitude for the burst emission region and a triggering mechanism connected to the surface active zone. Finally, our radio observations at several epochs and multiple frequencies reveal no evidence of pulsed or burst-like radio emission."

Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting). The SWAT+ (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way, where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and subtropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT+ model for northeastern Africa.

We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) ET data, respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations, especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs), which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in areas where they occur using regional to global hydrological models."

An Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to test such hypothesis across the Contiguous United States during April 2015 – December 2018. The performance of the proposed methodology is assessed for several modeled vegetation and water variables (evapotranspiration, net ecosystem exchange, and soil moisture) in terms of random errors and anomaly correlation coefficients against a set of independent validation datasets (i.e., Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model, FLUXCOM,  and International Soil Moisture Network). Results show that the assimilation of leaf area index mostly improves the estimation of evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange, whereas the assimilation of surface soil moisture alone improves surface soil moisture content, especially in the western US, in terms of both root mean squared error and anomaly correlation coefficient. The joint  assimilation of vegetation and soil moisture information combines the  results of individual vegetation and soil moisture assimilations and reduces errors (and increases correlations with the reference datasets) in evapotranspiration, net ecosystem exchange, and surface soil moisture simulated by the land surface model. However, because soil  moisture satellite observations only provide information on the water content in the top 5 cm of the soil column, the impact of the proposed data assimilation technique on root zone soil moisture is limited. This work moves one step forward in the direction of improving our estimation and understanding of land surface interactions using a multi-variate data assimilation approach, which can be particularly useful in regions of the world where ground observations are sparse or missing altogether."

The system accomplishes this reduction through a Monte Carlo optimization in which many independent MaxEnt runs, operating on a species occurrence file and a small set of randomly selected variables in a large collection of variables, converge on an estimate of the top contributing predictors in the larger collection. These top predictors can be viewed as potential candidates in the variable selection step of the ecological niche modeling process. MERRA/Max’s Monte Carlo algorithm operates on files stored in the underlying filesystem, making it scalable to large data sets. Its software components can run as parallel processes in a high-performance cloud computing environment to yield near real-time performance. In tests using Cassin’s Sparrow (Peucaea cassinii) as the target species, MERRA/Max selected a set of predictors from Worldclim’s Bioclim collection of 19 environmental variables that have been shown to be important determinants of the species’ bioclimatic niche. It also selected biologically and ecologically plausible predictors from a more diverse set of 86 environmental variables derived from NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis, an output product of the Goddard Earth Observing System Version 5 (GEOS-5) modeling system. We believe these results point to a technological approach that could expand the use global climate model outputs in ecological niche modeling, foster exploratory experimentation with otherwise difficult-to-use climate data sets, streamline the modeling process, and, eventually, enable automated bioclimatic modeling as a practical, readily accessible, low-cost, commercial cloud service."

JWST is a joint effort between NASA, ESA, and CSA and was launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) on an Ariane 5 rocket in December 2021. The three-month launch campaign utilized enhanced contamination controls to meet JWST’s strict cleanliness requirements. Prior to launch, JWST was permitted to only be exposed to ISO Class 7 cleanrooms, whereas the processing facilities at CSG are ISO Class 8.  NASA, ESA, Arianespace, and CNES implemented temporary upgrades to the nominal contamination control operations for the launch campaign unique to JWST, including the use of vetted, portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter walls, pre-entrance cleanliness acceptance surveys of each facility and the intra-plant transporter, tightened cleanroom protocols, upgraded garmenting and laundering techniques, cleaning of Self-Contained Atmospheric Protection Ensemble (SCAPE) suits, increased maintenance, staffed pre-cleaning stations, adaptation of the house purge network, and a contamination control enclosure atop the Ariane 5 launcher prior to fairing encapsulation. The Ariane 5 fairing interior and Vehicle Equipment Bay membrane also received multiple cleanings, detailed inspections, and verification sampling to achieve necessary cleanliness levels. The fairing itself was specially sealed to protect the inner environment with just a small, door porthole accessible via diving board for final closeout of the purge interface. All of these enhancements together allowed JWST to meet its contamination requirements for launch, ensuring successful post-separation deployments and mission science."

The architecture of the remotely piloted aircraft system—highlighting several of the component systems and the functions resident onboard the remotely piloted aircraft and in the ground control station—is described to provide the context for understanding the complexity of the said system for a detailed functional analysis.

A near goal is set by NASA to return humans to the Moon andestablish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface for more repeatable and affordable expeditions.The lunar dust is one of the dangerous environment hazard causing serious problems for explorationactivities. In this paper, in order to study the impact of lunar dust on the performance of a thermalmanagement system for a lunar habitat, a dynamical model of an active thermal control system that iscomprised of a vapor-compression cycle heat pump and a radiator loop is developed. A heat pump to liftthe heat rejection temperature is required due to high lunar daytime surface temperature. Parametricstudies on radiator size, percentage of dust coverage on the radiator, and lunar habitat location arecarried out. The results show that lunar deposits can significantly increase the power consumption ofthe thermal management system. A dust covered radiator panel results in net heat input to the heattransfer fluid during the period of strong solar irradiance, causing deteriorated performance of theradiator loop. The lunar dust contamination problem raises the requirement of redundancy design of asystem for fault tolerance. A synergetic design of a thermal management system, a power generationsystem and robotic maintenance system is proposed to achieve maximal mass cut for a whole lunarhabitat system."

To date the structure, we conducted Ar-40/Ar-39 analyses on glaciofluvial sand and U–Pb analyses on zircon separated from glaciofluvial pebbles of impact melt rock, all sampled immediately downstream of Hiawatha Glacier. Unshocked zircon in the impact melt rocks dates to ~1915 Ma, consistent with felsic intrusions found in local bedrock. The Ar-40/Ar-39 data indicate Late Paleocene resetting and shocked zircon dates to 57.99 ± 0.54 Ma, which we interpret as the impact age. Consequently, the Hiawatha impact structure significantly predates Pleistocene glaciation and is unrelated to either the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum or flood basalt volcanism in east Greenland. However, it was contemporaneous with the Paleocene Carbon Isotope Maximum, although the impact’s exact paleoenvironmental and climatic significance await further investigation."

REACTER is a versatile computational modeling tool for atomistic molecular dynamics simulations designed to model chemical reactions at the speed and length scales of classical force fields. In this work, several recent features of REACTER were applied to the creation and subsequent mechanical testing of two classes of carbon composites: carbon nanotube (CNT) composites and carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). A network of CNTs was grown dynamically using the new ‘create atoms’ feature of REACTER. The CNT filler was embedded into a polyarylacetylene (PAA) matrix by simulated  in situ  polymerization to obtain the final composite model. To generate the second class of carbon composite, fully carbonized (graphitic) carbon fiber morphologies were created by the method of Desai et al. [1],  but using the advanced reaction constraints framework of REACTER. Two fiber models were created, representing a circular carbon fiber core and a flat surface, and similarly infiltrated with resin to obtain the final CFRP structure. Failure mechanisms were elucidated by simulating mechanically induced bond breaking, as characterized by third order DFT-based tight-binding simulations, via a reaction constraint on the total potential energy of the involved atoms."

Telemetry pointed to a short circuit failure of a Power Rectifier Quad Diode Module.  Astronauts removed the failed unit from service which was then returned to Earth for failure analysis.  The failure analysis confirmed that the quad diode module had failed short circuit.  The investigation identified silver dendrites had grown on the insulated, sloped edge of the mesa semiconductor die of the failed diode and also a 2nd diode in the same quad diode module.  Voids between the diode’s protective encapsulating ring and the die provided space within which dendrites were able to form and cause catastrophic failure. The NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) convened a EEE Parts Sub-Team to investigate root cause and to assist with risk assessment for all of the flight diode modules (4 distinct production lots) and the flight spares (from a 5th lot).  Analysis of the original diode manufacturer’s read and record screening test data identified some lots which contained diodes with parametric instabilities that could signal conditions suited for silver dendrite formation.  Computed Tomography (CT) X-ray screening inspection was performed on flight spare modules to identify diodes that do not exhibit voids between the edge of die and encapsulating ring as a mitigation against dendrite formation."

One key to the design of a high performance electric motor driven propulsion systems is to be able to estimate the mass and efficiency of a gearbox at various motor and propellor operating speeds. Knowing how gearbox mass and efficiency trade with motor and propellor rotational speed, allows motor and propellor RPM to be traded in an overall optimization of the propulsion system.  In this paper, a genetic optimization tool for estimating the mass and efficiency of gearboxes is presented.

The results highlight the importance of considering shapes other than spherical for the snow grains, which otherwise can lead to non-negligible errors in the retrieval of snow albedo from remote sensing observations. More importantly, it is found that polarimetric measurements provide a means to partition light-absorbing impurities embedded in the snowpack from absorbing aerosols aloft, a task traditionally prohibitive for sensors capable exclusively of measurements of total reflectance. Heritage techniques to obtain snow grain size from shortwave infrared observations of total reflectance are well established, as are those that leverage polarimetric, multiangular observations across the entire optical spectrum to characterize the optical and microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosols. The polarization signatures of near-infrared (e.g., 864 nm) observations carry critical information on snow grain shape. The prospected launch of space-borne polarimeters with proven accuracy, therefore, advocates for the development of data inversion schemes, to boost the accuracy of simultaneous retrievals of atmospheric and surface parameters in the polar and snow-covered regions, critical to climate studies."

This in turn sets the stage for their further evolution and eventual supernova, and preconditions the surrounding medium for all following events, with consequences for ISM energization, chemical enrichment, and dust formation. Understanding these processes requires accurate observational constraints on the mass-loss rates of the most luminous stars, which can also be used to test theories of stellar wind driving. In the past, mass-loss rates have been characterized via collisional emission processes such as optical Hα and free-free radio emission, but these so-called “density squared” diagnostics require correction in the presence of widespread clumping. Recent observational and theoretical evidence points to the likelihood of a ubiquitously high level of such clumping in hot-star winds, but quantifying its effects requires a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of radiatively driven winds and their stochastic instabilities. Furthermore, large-scale structures initiating in surface anisotropies and propagating throughout the wind can also affect wind driving and alter mass-loss diagnostics. Time series spectroscopy of high resonance-line opacity in the UV, capable of high resolution and high signal-to-noise, are required to better understand these complex dynamics, and more accurately determine mass-loss rates. The proposed Polstar mission (Scowen et al. 2022, this volume) provides the necessary resolution at the Sobolev (∼10 km s<sup>−1</sup>) or sound-speed (∼20 km s<sup>−1</sup>) scale, for over three dozen bright galactic massive stars with signal-to noise an order of magnitude above that of the celebrated MEGA campaign (Massa et al. 1995) of the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), via continuous observations that track propagating structures through the winds in real time.

As we demonstrate, this is especially true for the rapidly-rotating Be and Bn stars, owing to their high temperatures, geometric asymmetries, binary properties, evolutionary history, as well as mass ejection and disks (in the case of Be stars). UV spectropolarimetric observations are extremely sensitive to the photospheric consequences of rapid rotation (i.e. oblateness, temperature, and surface gravity gradients), far beyond the reach of optical wavelengths. Our polarized radiative-transfer modelling predicts that with low-resolution UV spectropolarimetry covering 120–300 nm, and with a reasonable SNR, the inclination angle of a rapid rotator can be determined to within 5 degrees, and the rotation rate to within 1%. The origin of rapid rotation in Be/n stars can be explained by either single-star or binary evolution, but their relative importance is largely unknown. Some Be stars have hot sub-luminous (sdO) companions, which at an earlier phase transferred their envelope (and with it mass and angular momentum) to the present-day rapid rotator. Although sdO stars are small and relatively faint, their flux peaks in the UV making this the optimal observational wavelength regime. Through spectral modelling of a wide range of simulated Be/n+sdO configurations, we demonstrate that high-resolution high-signal-to-noise ratio UV spectroscopy can detect an sdO star even when ∼1,000 times fainter in the UV than its Be/n star companion. This degree of sensitivity is needed to more fully explore the parameter space of Be/n+sdO binaries, which so far has been limited to about a dozen systems with relatively luminous sdO stars. We suggest that a UV spectropolarimetric survey of Be/n stars is the next step forward in understanding this population. Such a dataset would, when combined with population synthesis models, allow for the determination of the relative importance of the possible evolutionary pathways traversed by these stars, which is also crucial for understanding their future evolution and fate."

By adjusting the laser irradiation time during dipping, irradiation power, number of bilayers, and the location and speed of laser irradiation, a variety of structures with controlled thicknesses can be fabricated. Laser patterned multilayer PAH/PTEBS polymer thin films were fabricated and characterized with absorbance mapping to demonstrate several patterning approaches. Results for 1) two laser patterned tracks, 2) single laser patterned track with varied average laser power across the sample from a continuously variable neutral density filter, and 3) laser patterning using a beam sent through multiple circular apertures are described. Based on the variable neutral density filter laser pattern, for 20 bilayer PAH/PTEBS films, an absorbance difference between off and on pattern of 0.1 requires an average laser power of less than 15 mW at 405 nm. The patterns produced are on the scale of several millimeters, though they could be made much smaller by focusing the laser used for patterning."

However, virtually all observations of this deep-cycle turbulence (DCT) are from 0◦N,140◦W.  Here, a hierarchy of ocean process simulations including submesoscale-permitting regional models and turbulence-permitting large eddy simulations (LES) embedded in a regional model provide insight into DCT at and beyond 0◦N,140◦W.  A regional hindcast quantifies the spatio-temporal variability of subsurface turbulent heat fluxes throughout the cold tongue from 1999-2016.  Climatologically, the mean heat flux is strongest (∼100W/m2) within2◦ of the equator. The heat flux is slightly (∼10 W/m2) stronger in the northern than southern hemisphere throughout the cold tongue. The seasonal cycle of the heat flux, which is not everywhere aligned with the surface flux, ranges from 150 W/m2 near the equator to 30 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 at 4◦N and S respectively.  Aseasonal variability of turbulent heat fluxes is logarithmically distributed and temporally uncorrelated with surface heat fluxes. The aseasonal variability of turbulence is highlighted in 34-day LES of Boreal autumn at 0◦N and 3◦N,140◦W. Intense DCT occurs frequently above the undercurrent at 0◦N and intermittently at 3◦N. Daily-mean heat fluxes scale with the bulk vertical shear and the wind stress, which together explain ∼90% of the daily variance across both LES. Observational validation of the scaling at 0◦N,140◦W is encouraging, but observations beyond 0◦N,140◦W can facilitate needed refinement of mixing parameterization in ocean models."

New capabilities always come with safety considerations, some familiar and others less so. OEMs who intend to obtain FAA type certification for their eVTOL designs must plan for and execute sufficient safety engineering processes to demonstrate that credible hazards associated with these eVTOL designs are adequately mitigated. This work provides an orientation for eVTOL stakeholders, especially new entrants and those in hybrid roles, to the safety and regulatory context for assuring eVTOL aircraft for UAM applications. We further present selections of functional hazard assessment (FHA) performed on a reference eVTOL concept, with process and decision narration. The exercise allows exploration of several safety considerations specific to eVTOL systems and demonstrates the FHA process together with negotiation of some of its options and variations."

This technique is particularly apt for time-series photometric measurements. In this work we apply compressive sensing to time-series photometric measurements specifically obtained due to gravitational microlensing events. We show through simulation modelling the error sensitivity for detecting microlensing event parameters. Particularly, we show the relation of the amount of error and its impact on the microlensing parameters of interest. We derive statistical error bounds to apply those as a baseline for analyzing the effectiveness of compressive sensing application. Our results conclude that for single and binary microlensing events we can obtain error less than 1% over a 3-pixel radius of the center of the microlensing star by using 25% Nyquist rate measurements."

This is an extension of the previous work of the first author which covered factored interaction equations consisting of load or stress-ratios which were either solely constant or solely varying quantities.  The factored interaction equations for preloaded bolts consist of an axial load-ratio that is a combination of a constant quantity, preload and thermal load at preload, and a varying quantity, tensile and bending loads, and was not covered under the previous work.  Two forms of the factored interaction equations for preloaded bolts, arising from two perspectives, are presented and compared.  Closed form solutions for the tensile, shear, and bending loads as functions of the other concurrent loads that produces zero margin of safety are presented."

The improvement project began in June 2017 and ended in March 2019, with some work stoppages in between. The main purpose of the project was to reduce the background noise of the facility to enable better signal-to-noise ratio measurements of quiet aircraft propulsion concepts. The term background noise refers to the noise measured inside the facility without a model installed. This report discusses the details of the project, the
motivation for the upgrade and the history of the facility background noise levels that motivated the upgrade. This report is one of a two-volume set documenting the 9x15 LSWT acoustic improvement. The companion report[1] documents the “supporting studies” that were conducted as part of the improvement project, but do not relate explicitly to the 9x15 LSWT.

This simulation allows us to examine aspects of small-scale air-sea interaction beyond what previous studies have reported. Our study focuses on recurring intermittent wind events in the Gulf Stream region. These events induce local air-sea heat fluxes above Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies with horizontal scales smaller than 500km. In particular, strong latent heat bursts above warm SST anomalies are observed during these wind events. We show that such wind events are associated with a secondary circulation that acts to fuel the latent heat bursts by transferring dry air and momentum down to the surface. The intensity of this secondary circulation is related to the strength of small-scale SST fronts that border SST anomalies. The study of such phenomena requires high-resolution in both the atmospheric and oceanic components of the model."

The test cases included a nearfield biconvex shock-plume interaction wind tunnel model and the C608 Low Boom Flight Demonstrator. Numerical simulations were conducted on the mixed-element and tetrahedral grids provided by the workshop committee, as well as a family of grids generated by an in-house approach known as BoomGrid. The nearfield pressure signatures were extracted and propagated to the ground, and the perceived loudness levels on the ground were computed. The USM3D nearfield pressure signatures, corresponding ground signatures, and loudness levels on the ground were compared with that of mean values from other workshop participants. The effect of three flux-limiters on the accuracy of nearfield pressure signature prediction was investigated and results were compared with that of mean values from other workshop participants.  The effect of using wall-function models for predicting nearfield pressure signatures was also evaluated. Results showed that the overpressure signatures extracted from the wall-modeled simulations and the wall-resolved simulations are in good agreement.  The use of wall functions (wall-modeled simulations) allowed for approximately 23% savings in the time to solution and yielded comparable perceived loudness levels on the ground to the wall-resolved Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes simulations."

The entry vehicle carried a set of instrumentation installed on the heatshield and backshell to measure aerodynamic and aerothermal performance, named the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation 2. This set of instrumentation included pressure transducers, thermocouples, heatflux sensors, and a radiometer, as well as a dedicated sensor support electronics system. All MEDLI2 hardware operated as expected during cruise and entry. MEDLI2 sensors gathered accurate pressure measurements in hypersonic through supersonic regimes to reconstruct vehicle attitude and atmospheric profiles. MEDLI2 on the heatshield sensors indicated that surface temperatures, caused by turbulent heating beginning 70 seconds after entry, remained at or below 1430 °C, while heatshield bondline temperatures rose less than 45 °C. Backshell surface TPS temperatures peaked at 630 °C, which was caused primarily by radiative heating measured by several separate sensors. The MEDLI2 temperature and pressure measurements enabled further detailed characterization of the Mars 2020 entry performance, and the flight dataset will provide a wealth of information for the EDL community and future mission designers."

Future space missions, including satellite servicing and large structure assembly, may involve the manipulation of massive objects, which will accentuate these limitations. Currently, astronauts use visual feedback on-orbit to mitigate oscillations and trajectory following issues. Large time delays between orbit and Earth make ground teleoperation difficult in these conditions, so more autonomous operations must be considered to remove the astronaut resource requirement and expand robotic capabilities in space. Trajectory planning for autonomous systems must therefore be considered to prevent poor trajectory tracking performance. We provide a model-based trajectory generation methodology that incorporates constraints on joint speed, motor torque, and base actuation for flexible-joint space manipulators while minimizing total trajectory time. Full spatial computer simulation results, as well as physical experiment results with a single-joint robot on an air bearing table, show the efficacy of our methodology."

This shift towards the commercial markets has changed certain ground rules in the electronics industry. Reliance of the aerospace industry, in particular, on components from supply chains dedicated to other products, or cross-vertical product integration, creates a supply web and introduces significant risks that are not necessarily present for volume-driven electronic products. Many of the unique risks in the aerospace industry emanate from the key characteristics of this industry. Although selection and usage of commercial electronics in NASA flight hardware is possible at a comparable (and in many cases lower) level of risk to that of employing parts that are screened to military or NASA specifications, for a large majority of flight projects it is difficult to distinguish the difference in on-orbit performance or reliability for parts screened at any level, or commercial parts that have no additional screening performed by the government. This paper identifies several bases for establishing context and developing unique or alternative approaches for successful parts selection and application within NASA and across the commercial space community."

In this study, we integrate satellite and modeling data that enable exploration of natural and human contributing factors to the unprecedented 2020 fires. We demonstrate that the fires were fueled by an exceptional multi-year drought, but dry conditions solely could not explain the spatial patterns of burning. Our analysis reveals how human-caused fires exacerbated drought effects on natural ecosystem within the Pantanal, with large burned fractions primarily over natural (52%), and low cattle density areas (44%) in 2020. The post-fire ecosystem and hydrology changes also had strong ecological effects, with vegetation productivity less than − 1.5 σ over more than 30% of the natural and conservation areas. In contrast to more managed areas, there was a clear decrease in evaporation (by ~ 9%) and an increase in runoff (by ~ 5%) over the natural areas, with long-term impacts on ecosystem recovery and fire risk. This study provides the first tropical evidence outside rainforests of the synergy between climate, land management and fires, and the associated impacts on the ecosystem and hydrology over the largest contiguous wetlands in the world."

The Langley center serves as a test range for unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and real-time knowledge about the location of people on campus is needed to inform least-risk UAS flight operations.  

The proposed system provides this knowledge through a camera combined with a convolutional neural network and an algorithm that projects an imaginary grid of square cells from the ground plane onto the perspective view of the camera. The position of detected objects on the camera’s projected grid determines their location in the real-world. The imaginary grid is easily mapped to a universal coordinate system, such as longitude and latitude, to provide both relative and absolute positional information of the detected objects. 

This simple system is shown to be accurate and effective, with decisive advantages over alternative multi-sensor and active sensor approaches. Extensions to the system are described to allow adaptation to a variety of other use cases."

You do not want to simply repeat what others are doing, so you must remain aware of other activities in your area of interest. You also have to maintain awareness of where the cutting edge is, because the limit of what’s possible is continually pushed and redefined. Finally, “smart” innovation involves not only seeking innovative solutions to anticipated problems but also being prepared to respond to unanticipated problems or even unanticipated solutions. As the leading U.S. agency for aeronautics development, cutting-edge scientific discovery, and human space exploration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) must remain at the forefront of innovation. NASA enables innovation in technology development through a coordinated effort among its internal mission directorates and its partners in government, commercial, and academic sectors. As an independent office, NASA’s Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy (OTPS) provides the coordination effort necessary to ensure innovation. OTPS uses and coordinates inputs from a broad community of experts. With these inputs, OTPS identifies and communicates shared needs and opportunities for partnership. OTPS provides strategic advice to synergize and ultimately facilitate innovative technology development both within and outside NASA. This paper summarizes NASA’s approach to ensuring innovation through a deliberately coordinated effort. In this paper, we first provide examples of how this coordination has enabled innovative technology development. We then describe how NASA’s mission directorates use input from a broad community of experts to inform innovative technology development. Finally, we describe OTPS’s role in coordinating inputs from both internal and external experts, including standardizing communication about technology developments, facilitating conversations with external partners on shared technology needs and solutions, and advising on strategies and policies to ensure innovative technology development. This paper can help members of the aerospace community understand their role in NASA’s innovation efforts and how to engage OTPS in conversations about potential partnership."

BACKGROUND: A Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (VIS) system is being designed for use with the European Enhanced Exploration Exercise Device (E4D) [1]. The exercise bar is attached to cables that extend and retract through openings in the E4D platform, which the subject stands on while exercising. Since the E4D is mounted on a moving VIS device, the whole system moves under the subject’s feet. While tension in the cables does help stabilize a crew member in 0g by bracing him or her against the moving platform, flexible cables do not offer full support against falling. This raises the question of whether various exercises that are successfully performed in 1g on a stationary device can be performed without losing balance in 0g on a moving device. Quantifying stability conditions and establishing stability requirements for exercise countermeasure systems is a long-standing challenge and this work helped to inform this specific need for integrated E4D/VIS flight project development.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A simplified stability analysis can be attempted based on platform accelerations generated by the VIS device simulation. In this type of analysis, the subject is conceived as standing on the platform in 0g while being held down to it by the tension in the cables. If the sideways acceleration of the platform is such that the cables cannot generate a sufficient moment relative to, e.g., the heels or the toes of the subject to overcome the tipping moment from the inertial forces on the accelerated subject’s body, the subject becomes unstable. This approach, which we refer to as the ‘static’ approximation, indicated failure of all the exercises that were considered in the comprehensive VIS analysis of the E4D. It was realized, however, that platform accelerations are not externally imposed but are themselves induced by the motion of the subject’s body during exercise, and a model calculation confirmed that this drastically altered the tipping moment on the subject, with the potential to even switch the direction in which the body would tip over. This made it imperative to consider in a coupled manner both the motion of the exercising subject’s body and the induced VIS platform motion while considering stability. The coupled dynamics requirement was met by the VIS simulation incorporating time-dependent human mass properties atop the platform and driven by the inertial forces from the prescribed subject motion relative to the platform based on motion-capture recorded human trajectories in 1g on a stationary E4D [2].
To analyze simulation results, a stability criterion was also needed. We do not know how to account for the human ‘control system’ that would take visual and vestibular cues as inputs as the platform moves in 0g. We thus chose to follow an approach we had previously used to analyze the dynamic feasibility of performing a task in lunar gravity along the human body trajectory recorded in 1g [3]. In this approach, one analyzes the center of pressure (COP) between the shoes and the ground (or platform) and checks if the COP remains within the convex hull of the footprints on the ground (or platform), commonly referred to as base of support (BOS). Since pressure is vertical and, in the absence of foot restraints, positive, the COP going outside the BOS indicates that the trajectory recorded in 1g is not dynamically feasible in microgravity and/or on the moving platform of the device.
The outcome of the COP-based analysis was that some of the key exercises, especially the deadlift and the back squat exercises, were found to be dynamically feasible for at least some number of the exercise cycles, this number increasing with the cable tension. While this type of stability analysis does not account for the likely alteration of the exercise trajectory from its 1g form in space, it does show that there exist at least some realistic trajectories that pass the dynamic feasibility criterion. This adds confidence that, with further adjustment by the subject of the exercise form in 0g on a moving device, a number of exercises can be performed without losing balance.

IDPs spiral in towards the Sun under the influence of Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag forces and are exposed to solar energetic particles (SEPs) that leave tracks of ionization damage in anhydrous silicate grains. We determined the exposure ages of track-rich IDPs using a new calibration of the SEP track production rate and show that track-rich IDPs have long exposure ages (>1 My) that preclude an origin from main-belt asteroids (MBAs) and Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). We propose that track-rich IDPs represent samples of dust produced by collisions among Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt objects (EKBOs) and that appreciable amounts of EKBO dust are contributing to the Zodiacal cloud. Many track-rich IDPs also contain abundant secondary minerals that provide direct evidence for past aqueous activity on some EKBOs.

Achieving mission objectives will require EVA systems and operations concepts that maximize human performance and efficiency while minimizing health and safety risks for crewmembers.
Currently, over 450 EVAs have been performed in microgravity using the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). The EMU space suit has enabled the successful assembly and maintenance of the International Space Station (ISS) for over 20 years, as well as deployment of payload experiments, solar arrays, satellite launches and repairs. This EVA work was accomplished at a slower cadence than is expected for Moon and Mars, with ISS crewmembers performing no more than 7 EVAs during a single mission and without any back-to-back EVAs. Despite their success, ISS EVAs have resulted in more injury to EVA crewmembers than may be acceptable for long-duration exploration missions.

The Apollo astronauts completed EVA tasks in suits that were designed for their short-duration lunar missions, although suit mobility problems were evident. The more frequent EVAs and more varied EVA tasks that are anticipated during the future longer-duration exploration missions will require EVA suits and systems that are better oriented to human health and performance than those used during the Apollo Program. Many of the problems that were encountered with the Apollo EVA suits (e.g., limited mobility and dexterity, high and aft center of gravity, and other features requiring significant crew compensation) will need to be corrected or mitigated to optimize EVA objectives of exploration missions.

It is critical that we understand how EVA system design variables such as suit pressure, weight/mass, center-of-gravity location, joint ranges of motion, and biomedical monitoring, affects the ability of astronauts to perform safe, efficient, and effective EVAs. To achieve this understanding, EVA researchers will need to develop and execute an integrated human testing program across multiple environments. The research will provide objective data that will enable informed design decisions and crewmember standards, thereby ensuring EVA systems that optimize crewmember health, safety, efficiency, and performance.

This report describes the risks to crew health, safety, performance, and efficiency caused by EVA operations, and it provides the evidence base to substantiate the importance of the risk."

for usage at the higher pressures and temperatures relevant to future combustor designs. In
the long term, results from this program can be utilized to validate high-fidelity prediction

We use the latest state-of-the-art composition-climate model simulations to contrast human exposure to fine particulate matter in Africa under a “baseline” scenario with high material consumption, population growth, and warming to that projected under a sustainability scenario with lower consumption, population growth, and warming. Evaluating the mortality impacts of these exposures, we find that under the low warming scenario annual premature deaths due to PM2.5 are reduced by roughly 515,000 by 2050 relative to the high warming scenario (100,000, 175,000, 55,000, 140,000, and 45,000 in Northern, West, Central, East, and Southern Africa, respectively). This reduction rises to ∼800,000 by the 2090s, though by that time much of the difference is attributable to the projected differences in population. By contrast, during the first half of the century benefits are driven predominantly by emissions changes. Depending on the region, we find large intermodel spreads of ∼25%–50% in projected future exposures owing to different physics across the ensemble of 6 global models. The spread of projected deaths attributable to exposure to fine particulate matter, including uncertainty in the exposure-response function, are reduced in every region to ∼20%–35% by the non-linear exposure-response function. Differences between the scenarios have an even narrower spread of ∼5%–25% and are highly statistically significant in all regions for all models. These results provide valuable information for policy-makers to consider when working toward climate change mitigation and sustainable development goals."

To calculate the N-factor, the flow variables are decomposed into a laminar basic state solution and the linear disturbances, which are assumed to be harmonic in time. The most commonly used linear stability analysis approaches include the locally parallel linear stability theory (LST) and the nonlocal, weakly nonparallel parabolized stability equations (PSE). However, these methods do not account for strong streamwise gradients that are encountered in several configurations of interest, such as those in the vicinity of roughness elements, steps, gaps, or corners. To compute the linear evolution of disturbances along such strongly nonparallel regions, the harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes equations (HLNSE) need to be solved. The discretization of the HLNSE for spanwise/azimuthally inhomogeneous laminar basic states yields a linear system of complex arithmetic with a leading dimension of the order of 10^(7) to 10^(8) even in relatively simple flows. A combined multithread and multiprocessor algorithm is implemented for the direct solution of such linear systems. Results for a supersonic boundary layer over a three-dimensional roughness patch show good agreement with experimental measurements when the evolution of the instability waves over the roughness patch is included via the HLNSE. Additionally, inflow-resolvent analysis based on the HLNSE for discrete-roughness-induced disturbances in the nose tip of a blunt cone at Mach 6 demonstrates the importance of including the disturbance amplification along the near vicinity of the roughness element and separation region."

It is currently undergoing climatic warming alongside other anthropogenic stressors, and contains a large below-ground carbon pool. Understanding how climate variability and multiple stressors impact peat accumulation in this region is critical to discerning how northern peatlands will respond to future climate and land-use changes. Pollen- and macrofossil-based paleoecological reconstructions, and analyses of aluminum (Al) and titanium (Ti) fluxes in a Holocene-aged peat core (VM375) taken from a bog in the Attawapiskat watershed were conducted to link ecosystem changes with hydroclimate and long-term carbon storage. Peat initiation is dated to 5780 cal yr B.P., coincident with land emergence driven by glacial isostatic adjustment. From 4500 to 4200 cal yr B.P., apparent rate of carbon accumulation increased, and was linked to more rapid rates of peat accretion and increases in minerotrophic indicators in the pollen record. This increase in peat accretion and shift in vegetation composition co-occur with higher rates of mineral influx as shown by Ti and Al concentrations, which may have supplied nutrients. A fen to bog transition takes place ~3300 cal yr B.P., with increases in Sphagnum spores and macrofossils, and a decline in the apparent rate of carbon accumulation relative to the earlier half of the record, where paleoecological proxies indicate treed wetland and fen stages. Since peat inception, the total carbon stock of the 260-cm peat column is 110 kg C m−2. This multi-proxy record shows an association between changing peat types and variability in apparent rates of carbon accumulation, and supports the hypothesis that mineral nutrients either supplied by surface hydrology or by eolian deposition played a role in Holocene peat carbon accumulation in eastern North American boreal peatlands."

Twelve sequential builds were conducted, each reusing powder from the previous build topped off with virgin powder to fill the powder chamber. Powder morphology, particle size distribution, flowability, and chemistry were examined for each subsequent build, along with the mechanical properties of tensile and LCF specimens built with each powder batch. It was found that only powder flowability demonstrated a trend with increasing reuse, with flowability and cohesiveness generally decreasing over the course of the 12 builds. Minor variation in powder chemistry was observed throughout the study, however, the variations did not correlate with increasing powder reuse"

As the event progresses, two flare ribbons spread away from the magnetic polarity inversion line. The width of the newly brightened front along the extension of the ribbon is highly intermittent in both space and time, presumably reflecting nonuniformities in the structure and/or dynamics of the flare current sheet. Furthermore, the ribbon width grows most rapidly in regions exhibiting concentrated nonthermal HXR emission, with sharp increases slightly preceding the HXR bursts. The light curve of the ultraviolet emission matches the HXR light curve at photon energies above 25 keV. In other regions the ribbon-width evolution and light curves do not temporally correlate with the HXR emission. This indicates that the production of nonthermal electrons is highly nonuniform within the flare current sheet. Our results suggest a strong connection between the production of nonthermal electrons and the locally enhanced perpendicular extent of flare ribbon fronts, which in turn reflects the inhomogeneous structure and/or reconnection dynamics of the current sheet. Despite this variability, the ribbon fronts remain nearly continuous, quasi-one-dimensional features. Thus, although the reconnecting coronal current sheets are highly structured, they remain quasi-two-dimensional and the magnetic energy release occurs systematically, rather than stochastically, through the volume of the reconnecting magnetic flux."

Data from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of an eruptive flare/coronal mass ejection provide ambient conditions for the evolving particle distributions. Magnetic islands, which are created by sporadic reconnection at the self-consistently formed flare current sheet, contract and accelerate the particles. The particle distributions are evolved using rules derived in our previous work. In this investigation, we assume that a prescribed fraction of particles sequentially ""hops"" to another accelerator and receives an additional boost in energy and anisotropy. This sequential process generates particle number spectra that obey an approximate power law at mid-range energies and presents low- and high-energy breaks. We analyze these spectral regions as functions of the model parameters. We also present a fully analytic method for forming and interpreting such spectra, independent of the sequential acceleration model. The method requires only a few constrained physical parameters, such as the percentage of particles transferred between accelerators, the energy gain in each accelerator, and the number of accelerators visited. Our investigation seeks to bridge the gap between MHD and kinetic regimes by combining global simulations and analytic kinetic theory. The model reproduces and explains key characteristics of observed flare hard X-ray spectra as well as the underlying properties of the accelerated particles. Our analytic model provides tools to interpret high-energy observations for missions and telescopes, such as RHESSI, FOXSI, NuSTAR, Solar Orbiter, EOVSA, and future high-energy missions."

Due to these differing mechanisms, compound daytime and nighttime heat events may respond differently to major anthropogenic forcings (greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols, land-use and land-cover change). Here, we use GISS ModelE2.1-G historical single-forcing runs from 1955 to 2014 to examine how individual anthropogenic forcings affect compound heat events—specifically warm daytime and nighttime temperatures compounded with dry precipitation or high humidity conditions. We show that greenhouse gases alone amplify the natural frequency of warm-dry events by 1.5–5 times and warm-humid events by 2–9 times in tropical and extratropical latitudes. Conversely, aerosols and land-use/land-cover change reduce the frequency of these events, resulting in more modest increases and in some regions, declines, in the historical 'all-forcings' scenario. Individually, aerosol effects are stronger and more widespread compared to land-use, oftentimes reducing the natural frequency of these events by 60%–100%. The responses of these compound events are primarily driven by changes in daytime and nighttime temperatures through large-scale warming via greenhouse gases and cooling from aerosols and land-use/land-cover change. However, changes in warm-dry events are amplified in regions with concurrent precipitation declines (e.g. Central America, Mediterranean regions) and warm-humid events are amplified by global concurrent humidity increases. Additionally, we find differences between daytime and nighttime compound responses in the historical experiment that can be traced back to the individual forcings. In particular, aerosols produce a greater cooling effect on daytime relative to nighttime temperatures, which notably results in a historical reduction of Northern Hemisphere daytime warm-dry events relative to natural conditions. Our analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of the significant impacts of different anthropogenic climate forcings on daytime and nighttime warm-dry and warm-humid events, informing future risk and impact assessments."

NASA currently trains astronauts in simulated lower gravity environments in either the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory or the Active Response Gravity Offload System (ARGOS), but neither of these systems allow for testing outdoors in field environments.  NASA, in partnership with Aquiline Drones, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and the Krenicki Arts and Engineering Institute, are working to develop a gravity offload device compatible with testing in field environments such as Desert Research and Technology Studies (Desert RATS).  This report covers the technical requirements of the gravity offload device, the design choices and justifications, options for scalability, current progress, and future goals.  Two separate teams were formed to respond to NASA’s solicitation, and this report covers the work of the weather balloon and drone side of the project.  Using a weather balloon to passively offload the user’s weight and a drone to actively respond to changes using a series of sensors, this system should create a consistent and well balanced offloading force.  The weather balloon and drone system is connected to a harness system to comfortably lift the user, offload at their center of gravity, and provide attachment points for some of the necessary sensors.  Final testing proved the comfort of the harness, mobility of the user, and passive stability of the balloon offload to exceed all expectations of the team.  The current system is a scaled model of what NASA would be able to implement with a maximum offload of 25 pounds.  The ability to scale up to NASA’s desired value of 100 pounds is easily achievable with linear scaling of the current model.  All systems should work similarly on scaled versions, but minor tweaking and enhanced controls would be needed for optimal performance."

Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida. The site is monitored under KSC’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program. This approach also meets the requirements of Chapter 62-780, Florida Administrative Code. For the purposes of this report, two separate plumes, known as the Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB)/Volatile Organic Aromatic (VOA) Plume and the Chlorinated Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Plume, were identified for this site. The contaminants of concern (COCs) for the PCB/VOA Plume consists of PCBs, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and breakdown products of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. The COCs for the Chlorinated VOC Plume are tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, and vinyl chloride.

The activities presented in this report include two field events: (1) November 2021 – PCB/VOA Plume groundwater sampling via Direct Push Technology – 70 groundwater samples were collected from 10 locations at varying intervals; and (2) December 2021 – Site-wide semi-annual water level measurements of 54 monitoring wells, redevelopment of 5 monitoring wells, and sampling of 35 monitoring wells.

Results for the PCB/VOA plume demonstrated COCs have not rebounded since the 2018 source removal, with groundwater cleanup target levels (GCTLs) exceeded in the 10-30 ft. below ground surface interval only.  

In the Chlorinated VOC plume area, there were no detections of COCs above a GCTL for at least the second consecutive sampling event for the sampled wells.  Cleanup objectives have been met, and it is recommended that VOC monitoring be discontinued.  Underground injection control parameters will continue to be monitored in three wells until those analytes return to background concentrations."

In this work, areas of high groundwater use and demand in drought-prone Kenya were identified and forecasted prior to the dry season. Estimates of groundwater use were extended from a sentinel network of 69 in-situ sensored mechanical boreholes to the region with satellite data and a machine learning model. The sensors contributed 756 site-month observations from June 2017 to September 2021 for model building and validation at a density of approximately one sensor per 3700 sq.km. An ensemble of 19 parameterized algorithms was informed by features including satellite-derived precipitation, surface water availability, vegetation indices, hydrologic land surface modeling, and site characteristics to dichotomize high groundwater pump utilization. Three operational definitions of high demand on groundwater infrastructure were considered: 1) mechanical runtime of pumps greater than a quarter of a day (6+ hr) and daily per capita volume extractions indicative of 2) domestic water needs (35+ L), and 3) intermediate needs including livestock (75+ L). Gridded interpolation of localized groundwater use and demand was provided from 2017 to 2020 and forecasted for the 2021 dry season, June–September 2021. Cross-validated skill for contemporary estimates of daily pump runtime and daily volume extraction to meet domestic and intermediate water needs was 68%, 69%, and 75%, respectively. Forecasts were externally validated with an accuracy of at least 56%, 70%, or 72% for each groundwater use definition. The groundwater maps are accessible to stakeholders including the Kenya National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). These maps represent the first operational spatially-explicit sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) estimates of groundwater use and demand in the literature. Knowledge of historical and forecasted groundwater use is anticipated to improve decision-making and resource allocation for a range of early warning early action applications."

Such tools can be built into virtual environments to support scientific investigations, as well as situational awareness, real-time decision making, and efficient communication between astronauts and ground and support systems. Understanding how these tools can be optimized for science is essential for upcoming Artemis missions. In this contribution, we discuss how measurements of surface texture at multiple length scales can greatly enhance in situ science on/of the Moon, and eventually Mars, asteroids, and beyond.

Roughness measurements at various wavelengths directly support objectives defined in the Artemis Science Plan, including (O1) “understanding planetary processes,” (O2) “understanding volatile cycles,” and (O3) “interpreting the impact history of the Earth-Moon system” . Key scientific analyses enabled by texture measurements at different length scales include:
●	Sub-centimeter scales: Texture measurements can help constrain lava flow crystallinity, lava rheology, emplacement flow dynamics, and cooling histories (O1). Measurements of lacunarity (voids in fractal fill space) can shed light on eruptive volatile content, residence time of migrating volatiles, and near-surface volume available for micro-cold trapping of volatiles (O1, O2).
●	Centimeter–meter scales: Texture measurements can be used for the differentiation of individual lava flows, the reconstruction of local stratigraphies and emplacement sequences, characterization of post-emplacement surface modification processes (O1, O3). Derived roughness (polarization) metrics can be used in the detection of water ice and characterization of ice properties (e.g., purity, grade, depth, abundance).
●	Hectometer–Kilometer scales: Texture measurements can be used to differentiate major geologic surface units and surface structures (O1), constrain the presence of abundant ground ices (O2), and analyze surface modification and estimate surface age (O3).

Real-time measurements of surface texture across these multiple length scales will enable efficient sample identification and scientific investigations by future astronauts. To support these investigations and the objective classification of surface texture, virtual environments employed by astronauts should be able to instantaneously convert raw data into processed data (e.g., digital terrain and elevation models) and derived metrics (e.g., RMS, std, Hurst, CPR) and perform statistical analyses (e.g., PCA, outliers, correlation matrices). Such tools are being developed and tested by the Resource Exploration and Science of our Cosmic Environment (RESOURCE) team, a node of NASA’s Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute (SSERVI), and are an excellent example of the powerful synergies of human and robotic ground assets critical in the return of humans to the Moon."

Achieving these ambitious missions is not feasible using the traditional paradigm of launching an integrated, fully functioning system on a single launch vehicle. For example, science and human exploration missions will desire payloads that are larger than any foreseeable launch vehicle fairing, national security missions will require persistent assets that are mobile and resilient, and commercial space missions will require cost-effective ways to update to the latest technology on orbit.

In-space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) can vastly expand the performance, availability, and lifetime of space systems compared to the traditional paradigm of launching an asset with no intent to ever touch it again. ISAM capabilities foster an ecosystem that changes the space operations paradigm, creating the foundation for sustainable exploration and serving as a multiplier for other capabilities like space logistics, power generation, and reusability.

Previous achievements in ISAM have enabled ambitious human and robotic space missions. NASA’s International Space Station (ISS) operations and maintenance, servicing missions of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Northrop Grumman’s Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV) demonstrate the dramatic operational missions that can be achieved using ISAM capabilities. Many current and upcoming flight demonstrations are advancing areas that will enable the next generation of civil, national security, and commercial space missions.

This document describes the current state of ISAM missions, capabilities, and developments. Compiling and organizing the available ISAM capabilities will help mission designers incorporate ISAM technologies into their concepts, create the starting point for technology development plans and roadmaps, and provide technologists a survey of the field they are developing. This document divides the ISAM capabilities into 11 capability areas that describe the functions or activities that would be performed in space using ISAM.

This version of the ISAM State of Play is part of a continuing journey to encourage the use of ISAM capabilities in space. Compiling and organizing the current state of ISAM provides a simple resource for those working in the ISAM ecosystem to ensure that the advancements being made build upon the investments of the past.

Upon completion of its Primary Mission in July 2020, TESS transitioned to its first Extended Mission, during which it has returned to both the southern and northern ecliptic hemispheres and revisited most of the targets it observed during the first two years of operation. With future Extended Missions likely, the end-to-end time baseline provided by TESS will significantly exceed that of Kepler, enabling a plethora of scientific investigations into time-domain exoplanet science. TESS has already established itself as an extremely productive tool for studying visible-wavelength exoplanet phase curves. During the Primary Mission, we carried out a systematic phase-curve analysis of more than 30 transiting exoplanet systems. These datasets constrained the dayside hemisphere brightness temperatures, day-night brightness contrasts, and optical geometric albedos of a wide range of gas giant planets, revealing some tantalizing trends that warrant further study. In particular, we uncovered a tentative positive correlation between geometric albedo and equilibrium temperature for gas giants with 1500 < Teq < 3000 K. The new light curves from the Extended Mission have refined the measured astrophysical parameters of the previously studied systems and yielded statistically significant secondary eclipse and phase-curve detections for dozens of more systems. By comparing the phase-curve properties obtained from TESS observations separated by months or years, we have also probed for possible atmospheric variability, as well as transit-timing variations due to orbital decay or additional companions. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of the main results from our ongoing multiyear study of TESS light curves and discuss potentially fruitful avenues for further research as TESS continues its all-sky survey into the future."

Both planets show evidence of significant aerosol opacity along the day–night terminator. The spectrum of WASP-29b is flat throughout the visible and near-infrared, suggesting the presence of condensate clouds extending to low pressures. The lack of spectral features hinders our ability to constrain the atmospheric metallicity and C/O ratio. In contrast, WASP-80b shows a discernible, albeit muted H2O absorption feature at 1.4μm, as well as a steep optical spectral slope that is caused by fine-particle aerosols and/or contamination from unocculted spots on the variable host star. WASP-80b joins the small number of gas-giant exoplanets that show evidence for enhanced atmospheric metallicity: the transmission spectrum is consistent with metallicities ranging from∼30–100 times solar in the case of cloudy limbs to a few hundred times solar in the cloud-free scenario. In addition to the detection of water, we infer the presence of CO2in the atmosphere of WASP-80b based on the enhanced transit depth in the Spitzer 4.5μm bandpass. From a complementary analysis of Spitzer secondary eclipses, we find that the day side emission from WASP-29b and WASP-80b is consistent with brightness temperatures of 937±48 and 851±14 K, respectively, indicating relatively weak day–night heat transport and low Bond albedo."

In order to transport larger assemblies, like the Optical Telescope Element / Integrated Science Instrument Module (OTIS), and ultimately JWST, the Space Telescope Transporter for Air, Road and Sea (STTARS) was designed and constructed.  STTARS is a massive mobile cleanroom (longer than 2 semi-trailers) that provides an ISO class 7 payload environment while being transported by road, airborne and marine vehicles.  Temperature, humidity, and particle counts are controlled and continuously tracked, with fallout and NVR witness samples placed in strategic locations for confirmation.  Instruments or sensitive hardware were purged continuously during transport.  STTARS has 5 main components: the upper tent frame, lower tent frame, pallet, strong back and lid.  After transporting OTIS to Northrup Grumman (NG), STTARS was modified to increase its height to house the JWST Observatory on its voyage to French Guiana.  This new configuration was designated Observatory STTARS (OSTTARS).  OSTTARS was too tall to travel by C5 aircraft, so the trip to the launch site was made by ship.  Through JWST’s land, air, and sea transports, STTARS and OSTTARS kept JWST hardware exceptionally clean and safe."

Safety and efficiency of increasingly complex AAM operations are expected to require extensive use of automation, ranging from controlling the revolutionary new aircraft to managing flights dynamically in the high tempo airspace and aerodrome operations. Both onboard and ground automation will play central roles in assisting AAM operators with managing the flight paths of their fleet. This document presents a concept for dynamic path planning (DPP) automation applicable to AAM and other flight operations. The role of the DPP automation system is fivefold: (1) it creates a flight path with desired qualities of being feasible, deconflicted, harmonized, flexible, and optimal; (2) it monitors the progress of flight in a dynamic operating environment; (3) it supports the user in evaluating continued acceptability of the flight path in changing conditions; (4) it revises the flight path as needed to maintain the desired flight path qualities; and (5) it coordinates the flight path with airspace users and service providers. Key users of the DPP automation system include flight planners, pilots, and airspace service providers The concept allows for the system to be installed onboard the aircraft as well as on the ground. The system responds automatically to the dynamic operating environment to ensure that a safe and operationally acceptable
flight path is available throughout the flight."

These findings motivate a re-examination of prior work which has identified unusual properties of the set of twenty amino acids found within the full genetic code, while leaving it unclear whether similar patterns also characterize the subset of prebiotically plausible amino acids. We have suggested previously that this ambiguity may result from the low number of amino acids recognized by the definition of prebiotic plausibility used for the analysis. Here, we test this hypothesis using significantly updated data for organic material detected within meteorites, which contain several coded and non-coded amino acids absent from prior studies. In addition to confirming the well-established idea that “late” arriving amino acids expanded the chemistry space encoded by genetic material, we find that a prebiotically plausible subset of coded amino acids generally emulates the patterns found in the full set of 20, namely an exceptionally broad and even distribution of volumes and an exceptionally even distribution of hydrophobicities (quantified
as logP) over a narrow range. However, the strength of this pattern varies depending on both the size and composition the library used to create a background (null model) for a random alphabet, and the precise definition of exactly which amino acids were present in a simpler, earlier code. Findings support the idea that a small sample size of amino acids caused previous ambiguous results, and further improvements in meteorite analysis, and/or prebiotic simulations will further clarify the nature and extent of unusual properties. We discuss the case of sulfur-containing amino acids as a specific and clear example and conclude by reviewing the potential impact of better understanding the chemical “logic” of a smaller forerunner to the standard amino acid alphabet."

Currently, there is no standard metric to assess this effect, and factors affecting ACC are not well understood. This paper discusses the benefits and drawbacks of different methods used to reveal ACC including constant voltage ramp and constant current stress and suggest a power surge testing (PST) as a procedure for screening and qualification of PTCs for space applications. The suggested test is similar to the surge current testing that is currently used for MnO2 tantalum capacitors but assures dissipation of high power in the part throughout testing. Using various types of capacitors, the reproducibility of test results for different manufacturing
lots of PTCs and from sample to sample within a lot were estimated. The impact of moisture content, test temperature, stress voltages, and preconditioning were assessed. Thermal effects associated with ACC and the possibility of catastrophic failures were studied experimentally using an IR camera and calculated at adiabatic heating conditions. Possible mechanisms of the phenomenon are discussed and recommendations for testing to avoid failures related to ACC are suggested."

Recent Lyα studies during the epoch of reionization show evidence that ionized bubbles formed earlier around brighter galaxies, suggesting higher IGM transmission of Lyα from these galaxies. We investigate this problem using IR slitless spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G102 grism observations of 148 galaxies selected via photometric redshifts at 6.0 < z < 8.2. These galaxies have spectra extracted from the CANDELS Lyα Emission at Reionization (CLEAR) survey. We combine the CLEAR data for 275 galaxies with the Keck Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph and MOSFIRE data set from the Texas Spectroscopic Search for Lyα Emission at the End of Reionization Survey. We constrain the Lyα equivalent width (EW) distribution at 6.0 < z < 8.2, which is described by an exponential form, dN / dEW ∝ exp(-EW) W(sub 0), with the characteristic e-folding scale width (W(sub 0)). We confirm a significant drop in the Lyα strength (i.e., W(sub 0)) at z > 6. Furthermore, we compare the redshift evolution of W(sub 0) between galaxies at different UV luminosities. UV-bright (M(sub UV) < −21 [i.e., L(sub UV) > L*]) galaxies show weaker evolution with a decrease of 0.4 ( ± 0.2) dex in W(sub 0) at z > 6, while UV-faint (M(sub UV) > −21 [LUV < L*]) galaxies exhibit a significant drop of 0.7–0.8 (±0.2) dex in W(sub 0) from z < 6 to z > 6. If the change in W(sub 0) is proportional to the change in the IGM transmission for Lyα photons, then this is evidence that the transmission is “boosted” around UV-brighter galaxies, suggesting that reionization proceeds faster in regions around such galaxies."

Both the radiometers and USV are commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, with the latter being only minimally modified to deploy the C-PHIRE instruments. The hybridspectral C-PHIRE instruments consist of an array of 18 multispectral microradiometers with 10 nm wavebands spanning 320–875 nm plus a hyperspectral compact grating spectrometer (CGS) with 2048 pixels spanning 190–1000 nm. The C-PHIRE data were acquired and processed using two architecturally linked software packages, thereby allowing lessons learned in one to be applied to the other. Using standard data products and unbiased statistics, the C-PHIRE data were validated with those from the well-established compact-optical profiling system (C-OPS) and verified with the marine optical buoy (MOBY). Agreement between algorithm variables used to estimate colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption and chlorophyll a concentration were also validated.

Evidence for Thermal Energy Anisotropy Using Oriented Stacking,"The cosmic web contains filamentary structure on a wide range of scales. On the largest scales, superclustering aligns multiple galaxy clusters along intercluster bridges, visible through their thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich signal in the cosmic microwave background. We demonstrate a new, flexible method to analyze the hot gas signal from multiscale extended structures. We use a Compton y-map from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) stacked on redMaPPer cluster positions from the optical Dark Energy Survey (DES). Cutout images from the y-map are oriented with large-scale structure information from DES galaxy data such that the superclustering signal is aligned before being overlaid. We find evidence of an extended quadrupole moment of the stacked y signal at the 3.5σ level, demonstrating that the large-scale thermal energy surrounding galaxy clusters is anisotropically distributed. We compare our ACT × DES results with the Buzzard simulations, finding broad agreement. Using simulations, we highlight the promise of this novel technique for constraining the evolution of anisotropic, non-Gaussian structure using future combinations of microwave and optical surveys."

This is partly due to the fact that observational rescaling approaches for bias correction used in soil moisture DA systems are less effective when unmodeled processes such as irrigation are the dominant source of systematic biases. In this article, we demonstrate an alternative approach, i.e. anomaly correction for overcoming this limitation. Unlike the rescaling approaches, the proposed method does not scale remote sensing soil moisture retrievals to the model climatology, but it extracts the temporal variability information from the retrievals. The study demonstrates this approach through the assimilation of soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission into the Noah land surface model. The results demonstrate that DA using the anomaly correction method can better capture the effect of irrigation on soil moisture in agricultural areas while providing comparable performance to the DA integrations using rescaling approaches in non-irrigated areas. These findings emphasize the need to reduce inconsistencies between remote sensing and the models so that assimilation methods can employ information from remote sensing more directly to develop representations of unmodeled processes such as irrigation."

This paper describes the procedure used to create a dynamic model of an aft-mounted jet engine on a T-tail regional jet aircraft. This model enables simulation of engine operation at extreme attitudes. The model was subsequently evaluated at various altitudes, Mach numbers, and power settings over a range of angles of attack and sideslip, and deterioration levels. Each case was simulated using both fan speed and engine pressure ratio as the engine control variable. The results show that the wing has a very large impact on the engine operation, overwhelming other sources of variation."

We show in observations that some glaciers have remained at peaks in bed topography without retreating despite enduring significant changes in climate. Observations also indicate that some glaciers which persist at bed peaks undergo sudden retreat years or decades after the onset of local ocean or atmospheric warming. Using model simulations, we show that persistence of a glacier at a bed peak is caused by ice slowing as it flows up a reverse-sloping bed to the peak. Persistence at bed peaks may lead to two very different future behaviors for a glacier: one where it persists at a bed peak indefinitely, and another where it retreats from the bed peak after potentially long delays following climate forcing. However, it is nearly impossible to distinguish which of these two future behaviors will occur from current observations. We conclude that inferring glacier stability from observations of persistence obscures our true commitment to future sea-level rise under climate change. We recommend that further research is needed on seemingly stable glaciers to determine their likely future."

This study examines information about the radio modules used by SWS and how they interact with the RF environment though analysis of historical spectrum data. This review studies the potential effectiveness of observing the power spread and occupancy methods as they apply to the flight system radios. It has been determined that viewing the frequency and time when the environment is greater than a threshold which indicates potential interference levels may give insight into the patterns of spectrum usage."

Using modulated output light from a Fourier transform spectrometer, the in-band relative spectral responses of the nine different configurations of SDSs were found along with out-of-band (OOB) sensitivity. From these spectral responses, the center wavelengths (λ0), full widths at half of the maximum, full widths at 1% of the maximum, and OOB rejection ratios were determined. All spectral parameters are within requirements. There are 2–8 repeats of each configuration, and the 1 σ spread among repeats is largest for the 1250 nm and 1615 nm high-gain configurations and is greater than 1 nm. The engineering requirement is for these values to be within ±4 nm and ±10 nm, respectively, of 19 the nominal λ0. There is also a λ0 temperature dependence, which is expected. This temperature dependence is nearly a linear function of wavelength with a 9.5 × 10−3 nm K−1 relationship on average."

By adapting readily-available equipment and supplies, this apparatus was capable of accelerating projectiles at up to 9 kilometers per second. The lack of a projectile-carrying sabot sacrifices some adaptability in projectile size, but results in a design that can be cleaned and cycled with far less labor input. Overall limitation on the projectile impact energies attainable effectively limit the applications to assessing the relatively thin shields employed for robotic spacecraft (as opposed to manned missions).

There is still much room for further advances in this area in the coming decades. Here we demonstrate this potential using recent advances in observation and understanding of the features known as solar coronal jets. Modern jet studies started in the 1990s, but have progressed substantially over the past ten years. Much of this progress is due to improved resolution and cadence in imaging, along with concurrent improved magnetic field and spectroscopic observations. Moreover, it is now clear that jets are smaller-size-scale, shorter-time-scale versions of less-frequent larger solar eruptions. Jets are also likely representative of yet more numerous eruptions occurring on smaller size scales. We propose development of instrumentation focused on multi-wavelength observations of jet-sized-scale eruptive solar activity, as a window to understanding both larger-scale and smaller-scale eruptive solar events."

Frequently, these tasks involve articulating objects such as opening or closing a valve. However, existing human-in-the-loop methods for registering objects do not consider articulations and the corresponding impact to the geometry of the object, which can cause the methods to fail. In this work, we present an approach where the registration system attempts to automatically determine the object model, pose, and articulation for user-selected points using a nonlinear iterative closest point algorithm. When the automated fitting is incorrect, the operator can iteratively intervene with corrections after which the system will refit the object. We present an implementation of our fitting procedure and evaluate it with a user study that
shows that it can improve user performance, in measures of time on task and task load, ease of use, and usefulness compared to a manual registration approach. We also present a situated
example that demonstrates the integration of our method in an end-to-end system for articulating a remote valve."

Longitudinal oscillations in prominences are common phenomena on the Sun. These oscillations can be used to infer the geometry and intensity of the filament magnetic field. Previous theoretical studies of longitudinal oscillations made two simplifying assumptions: uniform gravity and semicircular dips on the supporting flux tubes. However, the gravity is not uniform and realistic dips are not semicircular.

Aims. Our aim is to understand the effects of including the nonuniform solar gravity on longitudinal oscillations and explore the validity of the pendulum model with different flux-tube geometries.

Methods. We first derived the equation describing the motion of the plasma along the flux tube including the effects of nonuniform gravity, yielding corrections to the original pendulum model. We also computed the full numerical solutions for the normal modes and compared them with the new pendulum approximation.

Results. We find that the nonuniform gravity introduces a significant modification in the pendulum model. We also found a cut-off period; i.e., the longitudinal oscillations cannot have a period longer than 167 min. In addition, considering different tube geometries, the period depends almost exclusively on the radius of curvature at the bottom of the dip.

Conclusions. We conclude that nonuniform gravity significantly modifies the pendulum model. These corrections are important for prominence seismology, because the inferred values of the radius of curvature and minimum magnetic-field strength differ substantially from those of the old model. However, we find that the corrected pendulum model is quite robust and is still valid for noncircular dips."

We also use ∑O/N(2) derived from the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) limb measurements onboard the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite and estimated by the NRLMSISE-00 empirical model to aid our investigation. We found that the ∑O/N(2) seasonal variation is hemispherically asymmetric: in the southern hemisphere, it exhibits the well-known annual and semiannual pattern, with highs near the equinoxes, and primary and secondary lows near the solstices. In the northern hemisphere, it is dominated by an annual variation, with a minor semiannual component with the highs shifting toward the wintertime. We also found that the durations of the December and June solstice seasons in terms of ∑O/N(2) are highly variable with longitude. Our hypothesis is that ion-neutral collisional heating in the equatorial ionization anomaly region, ion drag, and auroral Joule heating play substantial roles in this longitudinal dependency. Finally, the rate of change in ∑O/N(2) from one solstice season to the other is dependent on latitude, with more dramatic changes at higher latitudes."

Consistent with previous studies, extreme sea ice loss events are associated with moisture intrusions over the Barents–Kara Sea, which are driven by the large-scale atmospheric circulation. In addition to the role of downward longwave radiation associated with moisture intrusions, which is emphasized by previous studies, our analysis shows that strong turbulent heat fluxes are associated with extreme sea ice melting events, with both turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes contributing, although turbulent sensible heat fluxes dominate.  Our analysis also shows that these events are connected to tropical convective anomalies. A dipole pattern of convective anomalies with enhanced convection over the Maritime Continent and suppressed convection over the central to eastern Pacific is consistently detected about 6–10 days prior to extreme sea ice loss events. This pattern is associated with either the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) or El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Composites show that extreme sea ice loss events are connected to tropical convection via Rossby wave propagation in the midlatitudes. However, tropical convective anomalies alone are not sufficient to trigger extreme sea ice loss events, suggesting that extratropical variability likely modulates the connection between tropical convection and extreme sea ice loss events."

Such missions will require significant countermeasures, likely both technological and biomedical, to protect biology from chronic radiation exposure. Small satellites like CubeSats can inform these countermeasures by querying relevant space environments with model organisms over relevant durations.

NASA has launched five biological CubeSats into low Earth orbit (LEO) from GeneSat in 2006 to EcAMSat in 2017. Each one of these missions increased our understanding of the effects of spaceflight, while refining technologies and imparting valuable lessons to the next generation of CubeSats. The Artemis I rocket will carry ten CubeSats, each of them with its own objective. One in particular, BioSentinel, will conduct the first study of the biological response to interplanetary space radiation beyond LEO since Apollo 17.

Once it reaches its heliocentric orbit – after a short lunar fly-by – BioSentinel will measure the DNA damage response to ambient radiation in a model organism, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which will be compared to information provided by an onboard radiation sensor and to data obtained in LEO (on ISS) and on Earth. Once in interplanetary space, fluidic cards containing desiccated yeast cells will be activated by growth medium addition at different time points throughout the mission. Growth and metabolic activity will be tracked continuously via optical density.

BioSentinel is a complete, autonomous spacecraft capable of conducting experiments in deep space. Its 4U BioSensor payload is a fully automated and adaptable platform that can perform biological measurements with a range of microorganisms in multiple space environments, including the ISS, free flyers, and other platforms like the Lunar Gateway and lander vehicles."

Though the magnitude of radiative heat flux is small, the materials used on the back shell are designed to accommodate smaller heat loads. Therefore, an accurate estimation of radiative heat flux is required. For MSL, Brandis et al.1 performed radiation analysis on the afterbody of the vehicle. They used full angular integration to accurately calculate the radiative heat flux at multiple body points. The above analysis was performed on structured CFD solutions, and the present work applies the same type of analysis to unstructured solutions using US3D."

The method of normal-mode function decomposition is used to distinguish between balanced (Rossby wave; RW) and unbalanced (inertia-gravity wave; IGW) circulation. The simulations produce the expected canonical shape of the spectra, but their spectral slopes at mesoscales, and the zonal scale at which RW and IGW spectra intersect differ significantly. The partitioning of total wave energies into RWs an IGWs is most sensitive to the turbulence closure scheme and this partitioning is what determines the spectral crossing scale in the simulations, which differs by a factor of up to two. It implies that care must be taken when using simple spatial filtering to compare gravity wave phenomena in storm-resolving simulations, even when the model horizontal resolutions are similar. In contrast to the energy partitioning between the RWs and IGWs, changes in turbulence closure schemes do not seem to strongly affect spectral slopes, which only exhibit major differences at mesoscales. Despite their minor contribution to the global (horizontal kinetic plus potential available) energy, small scales are important for driving the global mean circulation. Our results support the conclusions of previous studies that the strength of convection is a relevant factor for explaining discrepancies in the energies at small scales. The models studied here produce the major large-scale features of tropical precipitation patterns. However, particularly at large horizontal wavenumbers, the spectra of upper tropospheric vertical velocity, which is a good indicator for the strength of deep convection, differ by factors of three or more in energy. High vertical kinetic energies at small scales are mostly found in those models that do not use any convective parameterisation."

In space, concentric traveling ionosphere disturbances (CTIDs) are also observed as a manifestation of air pressure waves in New Zealand ∼0500UT and Australia ∼0630UT. As soon as the air pressure waves reached central Australia ∼0800UT, conjugate CTIDs appeared almost simultaneously in the northern hemispheres through interhemispheric coupling, much earlier than the arrival of the surface air pressure waves to Japan after 1100UT. Combining observations over Australia and Japan between 0800 and 1000UT, both direct and conjugate CTIDs show similar horizontal phase velocities of 320–390 m/s, matching with the dispersion relation of Lamb mode. The arrival of atmospheric Lamb wave to Japan later created in situ CTIDs showing the same Lamb mode characteristics as the earlier conjugate CTIDs."

The frequency and severity of flooding vary spatially due to differences in land cover, surface permeability, and infrastructure. Marginalized communities tend to experience disproportionately high flooding and damage due to infrastructural inequalities and limited access to resources. To quantify these differences, we used the Natural Capital Project’s Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Urban Flood Risk Mitigation Model to calculate and create maps of runoff retention, nominal flood depth, and economic damage to buildings in Milwaukee. Our model inputs included land cover, surface permeability, and rainfall. To inform our precipitation inputs, we used NASA’s Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM IMERG) and National Weather Service (NWS) data. We assessed the relationship between flood risk and social and environmental spatial data including redlining, racial demographics, greenspace, and community resilience. The data demonstrate that flood risk is higher in historically redlined neighborhoods, majority Hispanic and Black census block groups, areas that lack parks and trees, and areas of low community resilience as measured by the Census Bureau’s Community Resilience Estimates (CRE). These findings will support our partners, Groundwork Milwaukee and Groundwork USA, in their efforts to promote the equitable distribution of resources and support environmental health in urban spaces. The end products of this project provide our partners with tools to assess urban flooding vulnerability, guide future intervention projects, quantify the effects of environmental injustice, and improve stakeholder access to data."

The analysis considered regional O3 vertical observations from ozonesondes, surface carbon monoxide (CO) observations from flasks, and three-dimensional chemistry-transport model simulations of the global troposphere. Two 21-year-long numerical simulations, with and without biomass burning emissions, were performed to disentangle the importance of biomass burning relative to stratospheric intrusions for ambient ozone levels in the region. Tagged tracers of O3 from the stratosphere and CO from various biomass burning regions have been used to track the impact of these different regions on the southern tropical Pacific O3 and CO levels. Patterns have been analyzed based on atmospheric dynamics variability.

Considering the interannual variability in the observations, the model can capture the observed ozone gradients in the troposphere with a positive bias of 7.5 % in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) as well as near the surface. Remarkably, even the most pristine region of the global ocean is affected by distant biomass burning emissions by convective outflow through the mid and high troposphere and subsequent subsidence over the pristine oceanic region. Therefore, the biomass burning contribution to tropospheric CO levels maximizes in the UTLS. The Southeast Asian open fires have been identified as the major contributing source to CO from biomass burning in the tropical South Pacific, contributing on average for the study period about 8.5 and 13 ppbv of CO at Rapa Nui and Samoa, respectively, at an altitude of around 12 km during the burning season in the spring of the Southern Hemisphere. South America is the second-most important biomass burning source region that influences the study area. Its impact maximizes in the lower troposphere (6.5 ppbv for Rapa Nui and 3.8 ppbv for Samoa). All biomass burning sources contribute about 15–23 ppbv of CO at Rapa Nui and Samoa and account for about 25 % of the total CO in the entire troposphere of the tropical and subtropical South Pacific. This impact is also seen on tropospheric O3, to which biomass burning O3 precursor emissions contribute only a few ppbv during the burning period, while the stratosphere–troposphere exchange is the most important source of O3 for the mid troposphere of the South Pacific Ocean, contributing about 15–20 ppbv in the subtropics."

After more than 17 years in orbit the instrument is still functioning satisfactorily and in principle can continue doing so until the expected decommissioning of its platform Aura in 2025. In order to continue the datasets acquired by OMI and the Microwave Limb Sounder, the mission was extended up to at least 2023.

Actions have been taken to ensure the proper functioning of the OMI operations, the data processing, and the calibration monitoring system until the eventual end of the mission. For the data processing a new level-0 (L0) to level-1b (L1b) data processor was built based on the recent developments for the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). With corrections for the degradation of the instrument now included, it is feasible to generate a new data collection to
supersede the current collection-3 data products and reprocess the data of the entire mission up to now.

This paper describes the differences between the collection-3 and collection-4 data. It will be shown that the collection-4 L1b data comprise a clear improvement with respect to the previous collections. By correcting for the gentle optical and electronic aging that has occurred over the past 17 years, OMI’s ability to make trend-quality ozone measurements has further improved."

The most important space weather effects occur during these bursts. Previous modeling and forecasting efforts have focused on time-scales of hours-to-days and decades-to-centuries. The recent discovery of Rossby waves in the Sun, together with recently developed global models of solar MHD Rossby waves and their interactions with differential rotation and
spot-producing magnetic fields, reveal the opportunity to simulate and predict the occurrence, strength and location of enhanced activity bursts a few weeks up to several months in advance. We now have a golden opportunity to fill in this gap in time-scales of forecasting space weather. This requires a) continuous observations of solar Rossby waves by various techniques; b) development of coupled nonlinear MHD models that simulate both global Rossby waves and the much smaller spatial scale emergence of new active regions; c) application of advanced data assimilation techniques to couple surface observations to update the model-system to integrate forward in time for creating forecasts
months ahead. Then it will be possible to build operational prediction models to meet the needs of customers and stakeholders, including support of future NASA missions, regarding what kind and level of space weather to expect a few weeks to several months ahead."

(DNAPL) Source Zone (DSZ) and Hot Spot 6 (HS 6) Air Sparge (AS) System presents the results of Year 12 operation of the hydraulic containment (HC) Interim Measure (IM), the results of performance monitoring direct-push technology (DPT) sampling and monitoring well sampling conducted in the DSZ, and the results of operations and performance sampling of the HS 6 AS IM at Launch Complex 34 (LC34), located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS), Florida. Site-wide biennial LTM sampling was not conducted during this reporting period and is scheduled to be conducted in December 2022. The timeframe for activities documented in this PMR extends from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022. LC34 has been designated Solid Waste Management Unit CC054 under the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program.

The objective of the HC IM at LC34 is to contain the DSZ and deep dissolved-phase trichloroethene (TCE) high concentration plume via operation of a hydraulic containment system
(HCS). The pre-IM design 300 micrograms per liter (μg/L) TCE groundwater contour was used
to establish the deep zone capture area for deep recovery wells, and the shallow zone capture
area was defined by the DSZ. The system began operating in 2010, and in 2015, the system was
expanded to provide HC for areas within the 300 μg/L TCE groundwater isocontours of HS 3
and 4. In 2018 and 2019, an investigation was conducted to re-characterize the DSZ, which
included investigating TCE mass in Layer 7. This data was subsequently used to optimize the
pumping rates of the HCS to more adequately capture residual contaminant mass.

The operational period for Year 12 of the HCS was from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022.
Operational runtime for the system was 94 percent during Year 12, with downtime events
attributed to planned maintenance, system repairs, and power outages. As of March 31, 2022, a
total of 285,712,801 gallons of groundwater containing 84,933 pounds of VOCs have been
removed by the HCS. Influent concentrations of TCE have decreased since startup from
approximately 280,000 µg/L (January 2010) to 12,000 µg/L (March 2022). During the reporting
period, all effluent concentrations from the HCS (aqueous and vapor) were below regulatory
reporting limits, indicating the system continues to operate as intended.

Performance monitoring was conducted in December 2021 within the DSZ to evaluate TCE
contamination. Groundwater samples were collected via DPT at nine locations, consistent with
previous events in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Full vertical profile sampling was completed at
each DPT from 8 to 98 ft bls, at 5 foot intervals. The DPT performance monitoring results are
summarized in this PMR. The results revealed TCE remains at concentrations greater than
11,000 µg/L in the DSZ (1-percent solubility, indicative of DNAPL) at eight of the nine DPT
locations at depths ranging from 8 to 98 ft bls. An overall increasing trend of TCE concentrations
was observed in DPT samples during this reporting period, which may be due to several recovery
wells that were turned off during the AS Pilot Study in the DSZ that operated from July 2021 to
February 2022 (documented separately from this report). The maximum TCE concentration in
2021 was 15,400,000 µg/L in the 58 ft bls depth interval at DPT597 (previous maximum result
in 2020 was 1,690,000 at 48 ft bls at DPT596). During the 2021 DPT event, the overall majority
of TCE contamination was identified in the 58 ft bls interval (below Layer 4), where in the
previous year the majority of mass was observed in Layer 4. This trend appears to indicate
continued mass discharge from Layer 4 (fine-grained unit). In addition to DPT sampling,
monitoring well samples were collected from deep wells in the DSZ area (Layers 7 and 8) to
verify vertical delineation. All monitoring well results were non-detect or below cleanup levels,
with exception of one well (IW0162, screened 105 to 115 ft bls, which is below the existing
recovery well capture zone) where TCE was identified above cleanup target levels.

The HS 6 AS system remained operational during the reporting period covered under this report.
The HS 6 AS IM was initiated in 2018 with 160 AS wells, and expanded in 2019 with an
additional 140 AS wells. Quarterly performance monitoring was reduced to semi-annual prior to
this operational period. The results of the HS 6 system operation and semi-annual performance
monitoring are summarized in this report. Semi-annual monitoring results collected in April and
October 2021 show concentrations of contaminants of concern (cis-1,2-dichloroethene, trans-1,2-
dichloroethene, and vinyl chloride) are generally decreasing and not impacting the surface water
drainage canal, indicating the HS 6 IM is meeting objectives.

Overall, the tasks associated with Year 12 operation of the HC IM and operation of the HS 6 AS
IM were performed in accordance with the recommendations of the 2020 LC34 (Year 11) Operations, Maintenance, and Monitoring Report for DNAPL Source Zone, Site Wide LongTerm Monitoring, and Hot Spot 6 Air Sparging System PMR (NASA, 2021c). Evaluation of
results from the HC IM and HS 6 IM show that these systems are operating as designed and
meeting performance objectives."

While it has been shown to contribute significantly to surface precipitation at mid-latitudes, little is known about its occurrence at high latitudes. In Antarctica, two competing effects can influence the occurrence of riming: (i) the scarcity of supercooled liquid water clouds due to the extremely low tropospheric temperatures and (ii) the low aerosol concentration, which may lead to the formation of fewer and larger supercooled drops potentially resulting in an enhanced riming efficiency.

In this work, by exploiting the deployment of an unprecedented number of multiwavelength remote sensing systems (including triple-frequency radar measurements) in West Antarctica, during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurements West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) field campaign, we evaluate the riming incidence at McMurdo Station and find that riming occurs at much lower temperatures when compared to previous results in the mid-latitudes. This suggests the possible occurrence of a common atmospheric state over Antarctica that includes a rather stable atmosphere inhibiting turbulent mixing, and a high riming efficiency driven by large cloud droplets.

We then focus on a peculiar case study featuring a persistent layer with a particularly pronounced riming signature in triple-frequency radar data but only a relatively modest amount of supercooled liquid water. In-depth analysis of the radar observations suggests that such signatures can only be explained by the combined effects of moderately rimed aggregates or similarly shaped florid polycrystals and a narrow particle size distribution (PSD). Simulations of this case study performed with a one-dimensional bin model indicate that similar triple-frequency radar observations can be reproduced when narrow PSDs are simulated. Such narrow PSDs can in turn be explained by two key factors: (i) the presence of a shallow homogeneous droplet or humidified aerosol freezing layer aloft seeding an underlying supercooled liquid layer, and (ii) the absence of turbulent mixing throughout a stable polar atmosphere that sustains narrow PSDs, as hydrometeors grow from the nucleation region aloft to ice particles of several millimeters in size, by vapor deposition and then riming."

During solar minimum, it is in principle more straightforward to follow eruptive events and solar wind structures from their birth at the Sun throughout their interplanetary journey. In this paper, we report analysis of the origin, evolution, and heliospheric impact of a series of solar transient events that took place during the second half of August 2018, that is, in the midst of the late declining phase of Solar Cycle 24. In particular, we focus on two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and a following high-speed stream (HSS) on their way toward Earth and Mars. We find that the first CME impacted both planets, whilst the second caused a strong magnetic storm at Earth and went on to miss Mars, which nevertheless experienced space weather effects from the stream interacting region preceding the HSS. Analysis of remote-sensing and in-situ data supported by heliospheric modeling suggests that CME–HSS interaction resulted in the second CME rotating and deflecting in interplanetary space, highlighting that accurately reproducing the ambient solar wind is crucial even during “simpler” solar minimum periods. Lastly, we discuss the upstream solar wind conditions and transient structures responsible for driving space weather effects at Earth and Mars."

Employing the conservative cell magnetic field model for the magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and ignoring the conversion in the intracluster medium (ICM), we find the upper bounds on axion-photon couplings to be around 5 × 10^(−12) (nG/B) √(Mpc/s) Ge/V for axion masses m(a) below 10^(−13) eV, where B is the strength of the IGM magnetic field, and s is the comoving size of the magnetic domains. When including the conversion in the ICM, the upper bound is lowered and could reach 5 × 10^(−13) Ge/V for m(a) < 5 × 10^(−12) eV. While this stronger bound depends on the ICM modeling, it is independent of the strength of the IGM magnetic field, for which there is no direct evidence yet. These constraints could be placed on firmer footing with an enhanced understanding and control of the astrophysical uncertainties associated with the IGM and ICM. All the bounds are determined by the shape of the Hubble rate as a function of redshift reconstructable from various distance measurements, and insensitive to today’s Hubble rate, of which there is a tension between early and late cosmological measurements. As an appendix, we discuss the model building challenges of the use of photon-axion conversion to make type Ia supernovae brighter to alleviate the Hubble problem/crisis."

The third flight model is set to be launched as one of a complement of instruments onboard the Joint Polar–orbiting Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2) satellite. In addition to its 14 reflective solar bands and 7 thermal emissive bands, VIIRS has a unique Day-Night Band (DNB). The DNB is a panchromatic imager based on CCD detectors, covering a spectral range of about 500 – 900 nm. The DNB is made up of three gain stages, allowing the sensor to operate over a large dynamic range (3×10(−9) - 0.02 W⁄cm(2)/sr). As part of VIIRS pre-launch ground testing, the DNB has been characterized to determine its functionality and performance under a space-like environment. The results are compared against the design specification and to previous VIIRS flight models when applicable. This paper presents a comprehensive summary of the VIIRS DNB prelaunch testing and the results of radiometric and spectral assessments. The expected impact to 
on-orbit operations and calibrated data products are also discussed."

Since each participant will report his or her categorical level of annoyance in response to multiple events, the responses from any single individual may be correlated with one another.  Several models within the class of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) are pertinent to the analysis of correlated categorical outcomes; the random intercept logistic regression model is one example.  Both Bayesian and frequentist methods for fitting these models are available, with frequentist methods relying on some form of approximation (of either an integral or the integrand) that appears in  the  marginal  likelihood  function.   Given  several  anticipated  similarities  of  the  X-59  CRT  data  to data collected during a past risk reduction, Quiet Supersonic Flights 2018 (QSF18), this short note is intended to create awareness.  It documents an instance in which a reported population average dose-response relationship derived from QSF18 single event data was distorted by the integral approximation applied in likelihood-based methods.

A complete set of aerosol measurements were deployed around the volcano within the first month of the eruptive activity. This paper describes the results of the observations made at Tazacorte on the west bank of the island where a polarized micro pulse lidar was deployed. The two and a half months analyzed (16 October – 31 December) reveal that the peak height of the lowermost and strongest volcanic plume did not exceed 3 km (mean of 1.43±0.45 km over the whole period) and was highly variable. It steadily increased until week 11 after the eruption start (and 3 weeks before its end) and started decreasing afterwards. The ash mass concentration has been assessed with a method based on the polarization capability of the instrument. Considering the limitation of current remote sensing techniques to detect large to giant particles, the ash mass concentration on one of the days with the highest ash load is estimated to have peaked in the range 800-3200 μg m(exp -3) in the lowermost layer below 2.5 km."

precipitation observations declines, precipitation estimates, such as those provided by the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) mission, provide a critical source of information. Here, we present a new gauge-enhanced dataset [the Climate Hazards Center IMERG with Stations (CHIMES)] designed to support global crop and hydrologic modeling and monitoring. CHIMES enhances the IMERG Late Run product using an updated Climate Hazards Center (CHC) high-resolution climatology (CHPclim) and low-latency rain gauge observations. CHPclim differs from other products because it incorporates long-term averages of satellite precipitation, which increases CHPclim ’s fidelity in data-sparse areas with complex terrain. This fidelity translates into performance increases in unbiased IMERGlate data, which we refer to as CHIME. This is augmented with gauge observations to produce CHIMES. The CHC’s curated rain gauge archive contains valuable contributions from many countries. There are two versions of CHIMES: preliminary and final. The final product has more copious and better-curated station data. Every pentad and month, bias-adjusted IMERGlate fields are combined with gauge observations to create pentadal and monthly CHIMESprelim and CHIMESfinal. Comparisons with pentadal, high-quality gridded station data show that IMERG late performs well (r = 0.75), but has some systematic biases which can be reduced. Monthly cross-validation results indicate that unbiasing increases the variance explained from 50% to 63% and decreases the mean absolute error from 48 to 39 mm month −1. Gauge enhancement then increases the variance explained to 75%, reducing the mean absolute error to 27 mm month −1."

In the tropics, the response of surface O3 to changing climate is relatively understudied but has important consequences for air pollution and human and ecosystem health. In this study, we evaluate the change in surface O3 due to climate change over South America and Africa using three state-of-the-art Earth system models that follow the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0 emission scenario from CMIP6. In order to quantify changes due to climate change alone, we evaluate the difference between simulations including climate change and simulations with a fixed present-day climate. We find that by 2100, models predict an ozone–climate penalty in areas where O3 is already predicted to be high due to the impacts of precursor emissions, namely urban and biomass burning areas, although on average, models predict a decrease in surface O3 due to climate change. We identify a small but robust positive trend in annual mean surface O3 over polluted areas. Additionally, during biomass burning seasons, seasonal mean O3 concentrations increase by 15 ppb (model range 12 to 18 ppb) in areas with substantial biomass burning such as the arc of deforestation in the Amazon. The ozone–climate penalty in polluted areas is shown to be driven by an increased rate of O3 chemical production, which is strongly influenced by NOx concentrations and is therefore specific to the emission pathway chosen. Multiple linear regression finds the change in NOx concentration to be a strong predictor of the change in O3 production, whereas increased isoprene emission rate is positively correlated with increased O3 destruction, suggesting NOx-limited conditions over the majority of tropical Africa and South America. However, models disagree on the role of climate change in remote, low-NOx regions, partly because of significant differences in NOx concentrations produced by each model. We also find that the magnitude and location of the ozone–climate penalty in the Congo Basin has greater inter-model variation than that in the Amazon, so further model development and validation are needed to constrain the response in central Africa. We conclude that if the climate were to change according to the emission scenario used here, models predict that forested areas in biomass burning locations and urban populations will be at increasing risk of high O3 exposure, irrespective of any direct impacts on O3 via the prescribed emission scenario."

We combined a new model emulator and comprehensive emissions scenarios for air pollutants and greenhouse gases to assess climate and human health co-benefits of emissions reductions. Fossil fuel use is projected to rapidly decline in an increasingly sustainable world, resulting in far-reaching air quality benefits. Despite human health benefits, reductions in sulfur emissions in a more sustainable world could enhance Arctic warming by 0.8 °C in 2050 relative to the 1995–2014, thereby offsetting climate benefits of greenhouse gas reductions. Targeted and technically feasible emissions reduction opportunities exist for achieving simultaneous climate and human health co-benefits. It would be particularly beneficial to unlock a newly identified mitigation potential for carbon particulate matter, yielding Arctic climate benefits equivalent to those from carbon dioxide reductions by 2050."

Some wind tunnel fan blades, such as those in the National Transonic Facility at NASA Langley Research Center, have been in use for far longer than their planned 10-year lifetime.  No detailed analytical models of the fan blades from their initial fabrication were created.  To support the fabrication of either new, nominally identical fan blades or newly designed fan blades, accurate analytical models of the existing fan blades are necessary to demonstrate an understanding of the capabilities of the existing fan blades.  Additionally, the existing documentation of the testing of the existing fan blades has gaps.  In this report, a process for improving test-analysis correlation for these wind tunnel fan blades is discussed.  This process involved a detailed study of unknown parameters in test fixture parameters from the old and incomplete test documentation.  To improve correlation, these unknown parameters were used as design variables in an optimization study to minimize the error between test data and computed structural responses.  Legacy strain gage data from tests conducted in 1981 were compared with results from a finite element model created in 2019.  The use of test data from 1981 was necessary because none of the existing fan blades could be spared for use in destructive structural testing.  While this process was demonstrated for wind tunnel fan blades, this process could be utilized for evaluating unknowns in test fixtures for other structural test configurations."

The TMR includes the technical work plans for the DAC Demonstration for the six-year effort of the NASA ERA Project.  System studies indicated that DAC would reduce structural weight by 20% for both hybrid wing body and tube and wing aircraft.  A lighter vehicle requires less energy to fly so weight savings becomes reduced fuel burn.  Additionally, the hybrid wing body configuration has improved lift-to-drag ratios compared to the tube and wing aircraft, further reducing fuel burn."

In the journey to implementing space networking, NASA has considered several strategies. From direct translations of Internet Protocol (IP) to satellite networks to pre-planned routing structures in Contact Graph Routing (CGR), each potential solution for DTN has come with its fair share of setbacks and challenges. Frequently, these challenges can be traced back to specific assumptions made in the development of each protocol that do not carry over from ground networks to space networks.

To address these fundamental assumptions, a more general and foundational networking theory is required. In this paper, we survey a novel mathematical foundation for networking using the theory of cellular sheaves. Sheaves form a mathematical tool for modeling local phenomenon that leads to global effects. Sheaves have been introduced a number of times, and our goal here is to summarize the applications and point towards important future work that must be done to build a stronger, cohesive theory for networking."

Spray plasma associated with the CME is found to exhibit a Doppler blue-shift of 850 km s−1 – one of the largest values reported from spectroscopy of the solar disk and inner corona. The observation is unusual in that the emission line (Fe xii 193.51 Å) is not observed directly, but the Doppler shift is so large that the blue-shifted component appears in a wavelength window at 192.82 Å, intended to observe lines of O v, Fe xi and Ca xvii. The Fe xii 195.12 Å emission line is used as a proxy for the rest component of 193.51 Å. The observation highlights the risks of using narrow wavelength windows for spectrometer observations when observing highly-dynamic solar phenomena. The consequences of large Doppler shifts for ultraviolet solar spectrometers, including the upcoming Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) mission, are discussed."

While magnetic reconnection is considered to play an important role in this energization, it still remains unclear how electrons are energized and how energy is partitioned between thermal and non-thermal components. Here, we show, based on in situ observations by NASA's magnetospheric multiscale mission combined with multi-component spectral fitting methods, that the average electron energy ε¯(or equivalently temperature) is substantially higher when the locally averaged electric field magnitude |𝐸| is also higher. While this result is consistent with the classification of “plasma-sheet” and “tail-lobe” reconnection during which reconnection is considered to occur on closed and open magnetic field lines, respectively, it further suggests that a stochastic Fermi acceleration in 3D, reconnection-driven turbulence is essential for the production and confinement of energetic electrons in the reconnection region. The puzzle is that the non-thermal power-law component can be quite small even when the electric field is large and the bulk population is significantly heated. The fraction of non-thermal electron energies varies from sample to sample between ∼20% and ∼60%, regardless of the electric field magnitude. Interestingly, these values of non-thermal fractions are similar to those obtained for the above-the-looptop hard x-ray coronal sources for solar flares."

However, these whistler-mode branches, can implicitly participate in the heating processes of the core plasma thermal electron population by triggering the electron precipitation over a broad energy range from the magnetosphere and subsequent atmospheric ionization processes leading to the production of superthermal electron population. These superthermal electrons play a large role in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere energy interplay with participation of both magnetically conjugate hemispheres, and their Coulomb interaction with background magnetospheric thermal electrons. Using strong hiss and chorus wave events measured by the Van Allen Probes and SuperThermal Electron Transport code, we evaluate the formation of electron heat fluxes at the upper ionospheric altitudes and discuss their consequences on the formation of electron temperature. It is found that chorus and hiss waves that initiate the precipitation of magnetospheric electrons with energies below 30 keV and the follow-up production of secondary electrons play an important role in the energy balance of ionosphere-magnetosphere system."

These reports are often mandatory to submit, resulting in the culmination of large repositories of text-based documents. Simultaneously, these reports and corresponding repositories are often only manually analyzed and queried by users via out-of-date search engines. As a consequence, we have been developing the Manager for Intelligent Knowledge Access (MIKA) toolkit, which uses natural language processing to improve information access and reuse. In this presentation, we discuss natural language processing techniques for knowledge discovery and apply these methods to a repository of aerial wildfire mishap reports. Two methods are used for knowledge discovery: topic modeling and named-entity recognition. We use topic modeling to identify hazards and perform a trend analysis to produce a data-driven risk matrix. A custom named-entity recognition model, build from fine tuning a pre-trained language model, is used to identify failure modes, failure causes, failure effects, control processes, and recommendations to aid in failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). Throughout the presentation, we discuss and apply natural language processing techniques to better leverage the vast amount of information contained in report repositories."

Such media encompass planetary atmospheres and surfaces (including water/snow/ice), and plant canopies. In many situations the signals emerging from such media can be described by a linear transport equation which in the case of EM radiation is the radiative transfer equation (RTE). Solutions of the RTE can be used as a forward model to solve the inverse problem to determine the medium state parameters giving rise to the emergent (reflected/transmitted/emitted) EM signals. A novel method is developed to determine layer-by-layer contributions to the emergent signals from such stratified, multilayered media based on the solution of the pertinent RTE. As a specific example of how this approach may be applied, the radiation reflected from a multilayered atmosphere is used to solve the problem relevant for EM probing by a space-based lidar system. The solutions agree with those obtained using the standard lidar approach for situations in which single scattering prevails, but this novel approach also yields reliable results for optically thick, multiple scattering aerosol and cloud layers that cannot be provided by the traditional lidar approach."

In microgravity, vehicle thrusters can produce necessary phase separation, but in the absence of thrust, surface tension is the driver of fluid behavior. Liquid in microgravity will tend to form a sphere to minimize surface area. If a LAD can be made more “attractive” to a propellant (omniphilic), then it should perform its function more effectively. This paper presents preliminary results on using femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP) to change the wetting properties of a vane LAD. FLSP can make metals superhydrophilic or omniphilic; by controlling the applied laser parameters, the resulting micro and nanoscale surface features can be tailored to control and optimize hydrophilic/omniphilic properties. Two LAD galleries with guide vanes were recently fabricated, a control sample and an FLSP-treated sample. The LADs were ground tested and also implemented in a parabolic flight experiment. Based on contact angle and roll-off angle measurements of the surface-treated vane, FLSP appears to be a promising technique to improve efficiency of LADs"

We examine the 3D structure of plasma above an active region in a radiativemagnetohydrodynamic simulation to locate volume counterparts for coronal loops. In many cases, a loop cannot belinked to an individual thin strand in the volume. While many thin loops are present in the synthetic images, thebright structures in the volume are fewer and of complex shape. We demonstrate that this complexity can formimpressions of thin bright loops, even in the absence of thin bright plasma strands. We demonstrate the difficulty ofdiscerning from observations whether a particular loop corresponds to a strand in the volume, or a projectionartifact. We demonstrate how apparently isolated loops could deceive observers, even when observations frommultiple viewing angles are available. While we base our analysis on a simulation, the mainfindings areindependent from a particular simulation setup and illustrate the intrinsic complexity involved in interpretingobservations resulting from line-of-sight integration in an optically thin plasma. We propose alternativeinterpretation for strands seen in Extreme Ultraviolet images of the corona. The“coronal veil”hypothesis ismathematically more generic, and naturally explains properties of loops that are difficult to address otherwise—such as their constant cross section and anomalously high density scale height. We challenge the paradigm ofcoronal loops as thin magneticflux tubes, offering new understanding of solar corona, and by extension, of othermagnetically confined bright hot plasmas"

Using Chandra observations of a sample of 30 galaxies at D ≈ 200–450 Mpc that have high specific star formation rates of 3–9 Gyr^(−1) and metallicities near Z ≈ 0.3Z_⊙, we provide new measurements of the average 0.5–8 keV spectral shape and normalization per unit star formation rate (SFR). We model the sample-combined X-ray spectrum as a combination of hot gas and high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) populations and constrain their relative contributions. We derive scaling relations of log L^(HMXB)_(0.5-8keV) / SFR = 40.19 ± 0.06 and log L^(gas)_(0.5-2keV) / SFR = 39.58 ^(+0.17)_(-0.28), significantly elevated compared to local relations. The HMXB scaling is also somewhat higher than L^(HMXB)_(0.5-8keV) -SFR-Z relations presented in the literature, potentially due to our galaxies having relatively low HMXB obscuration and young and X-ray luminous stellar populations. The elevation of the hot gas scaling relation is at the level expected for diminished attenuation due to a reduction of metals; however, we cannot conclude that an L^(gas)_(0.5-2keV) -SFR-Z relation is driven solely by changes in ISM metal content. Finally, we present SFR-scaled spectral models (both emergent and intrinsic) that span the X-ray-to-IR band, providing new benchmarks for studies of the impact of ISM ionization and IGM heating in the early universe."

In this paper, we demonstrate a colorimetric sensing system that enables the rapid detection of gas-phase analytes released from a flowing micro-volume fluid sample. The sensor platform is an analyte-responsive metal-insulator-metal (MIM) thin-film structure integrated with a large area quartz micropillar array. This allows precise planar alignment and microscale separation (310 μm) of the optical and fluidic structures. This configuration offers rapid and homogeneous color changes over large areas that permits detection by low-resolution optics or eye, which is well-suited to portable/wearable devices. For our proof-of-principle demonstration, we utilized a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) spacer and evaluated the sensor's response (color change) to ethanol vapor. We show that the RGB color value is quantitatively linked to the spacer swelling, which is reversible and repeatable. The optofluidic platform reduces the sensor response time from minutes to seconds compared with experiments using a conventional chamber. The sensor's concentration-dependent response was examined, confirming the potential of the reported sensing platform for continuous, compact, and quantitative colorimetric analysis of volatile analytes in low-volume samples, such as biofluids."

With this in mind, we have created a Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences Research Topic ’The Future of Space Physics 2022’, to provide a format for a reference-able, peer reviewed, archived, accessible collection of these ideas from around the world. We wish to make these ideas available to the national academies decadal survey committees, the broader research community and a wider audience, by developing this collection.

In order to use current operational forecasting tools, a sensor capable of measuring both high-energy electrons and protons is needed. By combining high-TRL Timepix technology with a CdTe layer, this project leverages known technology to fill a critical gap for surface operations. Typical space weather sensors are at least an order of magnitude higher in mass than is expected from Timepix-based devices and are deployed on robotic assets away from human crews. High fidelity measurements at the crew location and subsequent ability are needed to provide warnings to crews to shelter with a device that can easily be carried on the Lunar and Martian surfaces.​ 

The aim of this project is the development of compact, low power space weather sensors for crew protection based on the combination of AES flight heritage Timepix hardware with novel CdTe (Cadmium Telluride) sensors. CdTe technology has only recently matured to a point where it can be reliably used with Timepix detectors. These detectors will be able to measure electron spectra in an energy range relevant to the RELEASE model, which is used operationally by NASA to provide crew early warning of Solar Energetic Particle Events as well as protons in the energy ranges relevant to human health allowing for event ‘nowcasting’ and total event crew dose prediction. Compared to existing solutions these detectors will be compact enough to travel with crew, providing a significant advantage to space environment situation awareness. 

Project results indicate that CdTe-based Timepix sensors respond well to energetic electrons, and particle tracks are sufficiently distinct to be able to measure in a mixed radiation field. Thermal testing results point to a needed design modification to mitigate high temperatures the detector will see in space. Radiation susceptibility testing was conducted to assess the radiation hardness of the CdTe-Timepix assembly. Overall, the assembly continued to operate up to 100 kRad of gamma-ray exposure. The system calibration did show drift over time but recovered once exposure was complete."

The team used land cover imagery from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Landsat 9 OLI-2 to map urban extent, and surface reflectance data from Maxar Worldview to identify roofing material types. Socioeconomic and environmental data were used to assess vulnerability. Results depict how the two cities have expanded from 2000 to present day and highlight areas of greatest vulnerability within each urban area. The supervised classification of roofing materials performed well but could be improved with a few enhancements. Findings can help partner organizations improve monitoring of urbanization and inform their planning and decision-making while prioritizing disaster prevention, public health, and environmental integrity. Additionally, these case studies can be used to inform future, similar work elsewhere in Central America to aid in understanding urbanization and its associated challenges."

In partnership with the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve and the California Department of Environmental Quality, NASA DEVELOP utilized satellite imagery to visualize and analyze the water quality of the Tijuana Estuary and southern California coast after major storm and wastewater events. Using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), we estimated the extent and severity of plumes released from the Tijuana River Estuary. We used remotely sensed turbidity to map the extent of plumes, and used remotely sensed turbidity, Chlorophyll-a (chl-a), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to quantify and visualize stormwater, wastewater, and mixed plumes from 2013 to 2022. Furthermore, remotely sensed CDOM, turbidity, and chl-a were validated with in-situ data from NOAA and the San Diego Public Utilities in the San Diego coastal area to evaluate the accuracy of water quality data derived from satellite imagery. End products of this project include maps of stormwater, wastewater, and mixed plumes, tables illustrating the average area, CDOM, turbidity, and chl-a of each plume type, and validation graphs between satellite and in-situ data sources. These end products informed the environmental management of the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve and the public beaches in San Diego."

We assert that resiliency can emerge from a layered approach of deliberately chosen capabilities with overlap and flexibility that, in aggerate, result in a resilient system. The challenge is to identify capabilities that contribute to resiliency and to accurately characterize their value. Resiliency is discussed through the lens of future architecture planning, outlining how the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) can benefit from a shift in approach when transitioning focus to the cislunar environment."

Extreme urban heat disproportionately affects Black and Latine communities due to systematic disinvestment in infrastructure and lack of resources to cope with heat. Our partner, Groundwork Milwaukee, supports Environmental Justice organizing around urban heat in historically redlined neighborhoods. This study explores heat mitigation in Metcalfe Park, one such neighborhood that is a focus area for our partner, as well as across the city and county of Milwaukee. Our team utilized the Natural Capital Project’s Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Model for urban cooling to model heat mitigation scenarios for Milwaukee in support of Groundwork’s climate resilience and heat mitigation work. The data inputs used in our analysis were Land Use Land Cover (LULC), evapotranspiration, and surface temperature derived from NASA Earth observations, as well as a biophysical table containing land cover class attributes. We developed a heat vulnerability index from American Community Survey datasets and satellite imagery to identify areas in most need of heat mitigation intervention. We found that central and northwest city areas, home to a majority of Milwaukee’s Black and Latine population, have low heat mitigation and high vulnerability to heat impacts compared to the rest of the county. We also found that tree canopy increases across scales are effective in promoting heat mitigation. Our results and end products will bolster the efforts of our partners to make decisions on heat mitigation strategies, build community resilience, and reverse legacies of environmental racism in the face of extreme heat and climate change."

To make this possible, however, there needs to be flexible means for manufacturing in space to enable tooling or resources to be created when needed to handle unexpected situations. Next-generation manufacturing paradigms offer significant potential for the kind of flexibility that might be needed; however, they can result in increases in computation time compared to traditional control methods that could make many of the computing resources already available on earth attractive for use. Furthermore, resilience is a significant focus of next-generation manufacturing strategies, and one way to enable resilience for space manufacturing would be to have backup controllers available on earth. These types of considerations raise questions about remote control and monitoring, as well as privacy of the data involved in such practices, that must be considered. This work provides a perspective on several topics tied to remote control and monitoring for manufacturing in space."

These types of hoses are found in a wide range of applications at KSC (Exploration Ground Systems Program in particular) with various fluid commodities such as fuel, oxidizers, coolant, and cryogenics. However, flexibility of design comes at a price: due to increased levels of turbulence generated by the hose geometry, the necessary supply pressure must increase to achieve the same flow rate. Furthermore, the convolutes of the flexhoses interact with the flow field to generate areas of flow separation which leads to a phenomenon known as vortex shedding. When the frequency of vortex shedding couples with the natural frequency of the hose, this can be detrimental and cause premature failure. There are a limited amount of software that can correctly model the coupled fluid structure interactions(FSI) between the solid and fluid physics. This project aims to develop a computer model that can predict Flow-Induced Vibration (FIV) on flexhoses in one of the atypical configurations found in the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) standard for hoses in an angulated state.

Our research seeks to extend the literature and expand NASA’s FIV standard. The computational rigor and resources available in the Apollo Era did not allow for flow coupling between fluids and structure interfaces to evaluate FIV of the flexhose. Our team believes that modern techniques and methods of evaluation should be used to reevaluate and extend the database of FIV and stiffness properties of flexhoses to assess the risk of failure. The core performance criteria is a computer model that is able to predict the FIV frequency within 10%."

This work established a standing, quick-turnaround quantitative GCMS methodology for KSC-specific VOCs associated with launching and landing spacecraft at trace-levels far below previous detection limits. 

Closeout Summary: This project established a standing methodology for rapid turnaround identification and quantification of 119 targeted VOCs considered most likely to be encountered at KSC. Of these, 111 of the calibration files are based on manufacturer-certified gas standard mixes. The other eight were generated using standards generated in-house from neat, certified reference materials using procedures for standard generation that were developed under this project. 

Additionally, the spectral signatures of two hydrofluorocarbon precision cleaning solvents, that are widely used in flight hardware processing, have been added to the mass spectral library for rapid qualitative identification."

In this Review, we synthesize understanding of compound heat and moisture extremes, their impacts on global crop yields and implications for adaptation. Heat and moisture extremes and their impacts become compounded through crop-physiological interactions, heat–moisture couplings in the climate system and crop–atmosphere interactions. Since around 2000, these compound extremes, and hot droughts in particular, have been linked to especially poor harvests (up to 30% yield losses) in regions such as India, Ethiopia, the USA, Europe and Russia. However, in some cases, combinations of crop stresses might generate compensating effects. Compound extremes are projected to increase in frequency and amplitude in the future, but, owing to the biophysical interdependence among temperature, water and crop physiology, the net yield effects of such future compound extremes remain uncertain. Accordingly, compound extremes will necessitate comprehensive agricultural adaptation strategies geared towards multi-stress resilience, as adaptations that work for single climate stresses could be maladaptive under combined stresses. An integrated understanding of heat and water in soil–plant–atmosphere dynamics is urgently needed to understand risks and suitably adapt cropping systems to compounding climate impacts."

Their origin in the largely unipolar coronal holes has long been a mystery. Earlier spectroscopic and imaging observations revealed blue-shifted plasma and propagating disturbances (PDs) in plumes that are widely interpreted in terms of flows and/or propagating slow-mode waves, but these interpretations (flows vs waves) remain under debate. Recently we discovered an important clue about plume internal structure: dynamic filamentary features called “plumelets”, which account for most of the plume emission. Here we present highresolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory’s Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) that revealed numerous, quasiperiodic, tiny jets (so-called “jetlets”) associated with transient brightening, flows, and plasma heating at the chromospheric footpoints of the plumelets. By analogy to larger coronal jets, these jetlets are most likely produced within the plume base by magnetic reconnection between closed and open flux at stressed 3D null points. The jetlet-associated brightenings are in phase with plumelet-associated PDs, and vary with a period of ∼3 to 5 minutes, which is remarkably consistent with the photospheric/chromospheric p-mode oscillation. This reconnection at the open-closed boundary in the chromosphere/transition region is likely modulated or driven by local manifestations of the global p-mode waves. The jetlets extend upward to become plumelets, contribute mass to the solar wind, and may be sources of the switchbacks recently detected by the Parker Solar Probe."

The archipelagic country of the Maldives is of critical concern due to being one of the lowest lying areas in the world. The development of reclaimed land in the Maldives by sand dredging has been a frequent response to both increasing sea levels and population increase. Such disturbance can lead to increased sedimentation off the coast and negatively impact coastal environments. Remote sensing tools such as satellite imagery have proved to be an effective tool in observing coastal changes in response to climate change and development. NASA DEVELOP created a methodology to analyze both water quality and shoreline erosion in the Maldives utilizing satellite imagery. Methods relied on open-source software such as QGIS and Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Satellite Imagery from PlanetScope, Landsat 8 Operational Land Instrument (OLI), Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI), and Aqua & Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Radiospectrometer (MODIS) to analyze the changes in shorelines and assess water quality of select atolls within the Maldives. Findings show less shoreline change in developed parts of the island and more shoreline change in natural parts of the island. Additionally, water quality varies throughout the year and our data did not indicate seasonal trends. The methodology will be replicated to continue to monitor island erosion and water quality with the Maldives and will be applicable to other island and coastal systems."

These ecosystems contain unique species that are only found in areas where near-surface groundwater is present, such as aspen groves and fens. These species contribute to the high biodiversity found in Bryce Canyon, which boosts an ecosystem’s productivity and the services it provides to the park. Unfortunately, many of these GDEs are too small to identify with traditional Earth observation platforms and are difficult to physically reach for monitoring purposes. This project partnered with the National Park Service to identify springs and seeps as a proxy for GDEs within Bryce Canyon from 2013–2022. Furthermore, this project tested the feasibility of various methods to detect and monitor springs and seeps and therefore facilitate the partner’s efforts to conserve these ecologically valuable GDEs in Bryce Canyon. The team mapped groundwater discharge with high resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and assessed park vegetation trends with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and PlanetScope imagery. In-situ precipitation data and the Western Land Data Assimilation System (WLDAS) were used to produce time series of climatic variables.

The stamp sands have been capped with sandy-loam soils and restored native species, but erosion and flooding threaten to re-deposit these stamp sands onto wetlands and into the bay. Erosion and flooding also threaten loss of beaches and shoreline, infrastructure, wetland restoration projects, and coastal highways, which has driven shoreline armoring. However, while shoreline armoring can be effective in protecting the intended areas, it can also exacerbate erosion in nearby unarmored areas, so its net impact on the shoreline is yet to be quantified. The DEVELOP team partnered with KBIC and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to utilize imagery from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) in order to analyze turbidity proxies. The results from these analyses showed that seasonal variation in study area was greatest during the season dominated by rain, but spatial variability across our study period did not show a clear trend.

These jeopardize population centers through increased risks to ecosystem services, local economies, and livelihoods. The Idaho Office of Emergency Management, Water Resources, and Department of Lands are seeking methods to dynamically monitor these conditions and update models that inform hazard mitigation planning and resource allocation. Towards this, these agencies partnered with NASA DEVELOP to produce drought-enhanced wildfire hazard models. Part of a two-term project, the two teams revised the state’s static wildfire hazard model with refined data layers and remotely-sensed data to reflect dynamic ecosystem responses to drought conditions and wildfire potential. Our team distinguished between rangeland and forestland ecosystems, and investigated relationships between drought metrics and vegetation condition using TerrSet Earth Trends Modeler. This analysis determined that total precipitation at a 5-month lag interval (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.72) along with the Evaporative Stress Index (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.69); and precipitation at a 5-month interval (r<sup>2</sup>  = 0.42) were important drivers in rangeland and forestland, respectively. These driver variables were incorporated into a temporally dynamic wildfire hazard map. Our team used linear regression to correlate hazard ratings with wildfire frequency. For the year 2020, neither the enhanced hazard model (p < 0.10, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.01) nor the state’s static model (p < 0.05, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.03) were strongly correlated with actual wildfire frequency as they expressed an inverse relationship between wildfire hazard and frequency. This suggests wildfire occurrence is complex and not necessarily driven by the variables used."

The presence of the 3.3 μm PAH feature within the DIRBE 3.5 μm band and the corresponding lack of significant PAH spectral features in the adjacent DIRBE bands (1.25, 2.2, and 4.9 μm) enable estimation of the PAH contribution to the 3.5 μm data. Having the shortest wavelength of known PAH features, the 3.3 μm feature probes the smallest PAHs, which are also the leading candidates for carriers of anomalous microwave emission (AME). We use this map to investigate the association between the AME and the emission from PAH molecules. We find that the spatial correlation in λ-Orionis is higher between AME and far-infrared dust emission (as represented by the DIRBE 240 μm map) than it is between our PAH map and AME. This finding, in agreement with previous studies using PAH features at longer wavelengths, is in tension with the hypothesis that AME is due to spinning PAHs. However, the expected correlation between mid-infrared and microwave emission could potentially be degraded by different sensitivities of each emission mechanism to local environmental conditions even if PAHs are the carriers of both."

This review summarises recent developments in the field of mineral complexity and outlines possible directions for its future elaboration. The database of structural and chemical complexity parameters of minerals is updated by H-correction of structures with unknown H positions and the inclusion of new data. The revised average complexity values (arithmetic means) for all minerals are 3.54(2) bits/atom and 345(10) bits/cell (based upon 4443 structure reports). The distributions of atomic information amounts, chemIG and strIG, versus the number of mineral species fit the normal modes, whereas the distributions of total complexities, chemIG,total and strIG,total, along with numbers of atoms per formula and per unit cell are log normal. The three most complex mineral species known today are ewingite, morrisonite and ilmajokite, all either discovered or structurally characterised within the last five years. The most important complexity-generating mechanisms in minerals are: (1) the presence of isolated large clusters; (2) the presence of large clusters linked together to form three-dimensional frameworks; (3) formation of complex three-dimensional modular frameworks; (4) formation of complex modular layers; (5) high hydration state in salts with complex heteropolyhedral units; and (6) formation of ordered superstructures of relatively simple structure types. The relations between symmetry and complexity are considered. The analysis of temporal dynamics of mineralogical discoveries since 1875 with the step of 25 years show the increasing chemical and structural complexities of human knowledge of the mineral kingdom in the history of mineralogy. In the Earth’s history, both diversity and complexity of minerals experience dramatic increases associated with the formation of Earth’s continental crust, initiation of plate tectonics and the Great Oxidation event."

The initial explosion and subsequent plume triggered atmospheric waves that propagated around the world multiple times. A global-scale wave response of this magnitude from a single source has not previously been observed. Here we show the details of this response, using a comprehensive set of satellite and ground-based observations to quantify it from surface to ionosphere. A broad spectrum of waves was triggered by the initial explosion, including Lamb waves propagating at phase speeds of 318.2 ± 6 m s^(−1) at surface level and between 308 ± 5 to 319 ± 4 m s^(−1) in the stratosphere, and gravity waves propagating at 238 ± 3 to 269 ± 3 m s^(−1) in the stratosphere. Gravity waves at sub-ionospheric heights have not previously been observed propagating at this speed or over the whole Earth from a single source. Latent heat release from the plume remained the most significant individual gravity wave source worldwide for more than 12 h, producing circular wavefronts visible across the Pacific basin in satellite observations. A single source dominating such a large region is also unique in the observational record. The Hunga Tonga eruption represents a key natural experiment in how the atmosphere responds to a sudden point-source-driven state change, which will be of use for improving weather and climate models."

These structures have been observed in situ and in remote data as fluctuations in proton and electron density. However, only two events of this type have been reported regarding the elemental and ionic composition. Composition measurements are especially important in gaining an understanding of the origin of the solar wind as the composition is frozen into the plasma at the Sun and does not evolve as it advects through the heliosphere. Here, we present the analysis of four events containing mesoscale periodic solar wind structure during which the Iron and Magnesium number density data, measured by the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS)on board the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft, are validated at statistically significant count levels. We use a spectral analysis method specifically designed to extract periodic signals from astrophysical time series and apply it to the SWICS 12-minute native resolution dataset. We find variations in the relative abundance of elements with low first ionization potential, mass dependencies, and charge state during time intervals in which mesoscale periodic structures are observed. These variations are linked to temporal or spatial variations in solar source regions and put constraints on the solar wind formation mechanisms that produce them. Techniques presented here are relevant for future, higher-resolution studies of data from new instruments such as Solar Orbiter’s Heavy Ion Sensor."

Balance of Sources,"The accurate determination of auroral precipitation in global models has remained a daunting and rather inexplicable obstacle. Understanding the calculation and balance of multiple sources that constitute the aurora, and their eventual conversion into ionospheric electrical conductance, is critical for improved prediction of space weather events. In this study, we present a semi-physical global modeling approach that characterizes contributions by four types of precipitation—monoenergetic, broadband, electron, and ion diffuse—to ionospheric electrodynamics. The model uses a combination of adiabatic kinetic theory and loss parameters derived from historical energy flux patterns to estimate auroral precipitation from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) quantities. It then converts them into ionospheric conductance that is used to compute the ionospheric feedback to the magnetosphere. The model has been employed to simulate the 5–7 April 2010 Galaxy15 space weather event. Comparison of auroral fluxes show good agreement with observational data sets like NOAA-DMSP and OVATION Prime. The study shows a dominant contribution by electron diffuse precipitation, accounting for ∼74% of the auroral energy flux. However, contributions by monoenergetic and broadband sources dominate during times of active upstream solar conditions, providing for up to 61% of the total hemispheric power. The study also finds a greater role played by broadband precipitation in ionospheric electrodynamics which accounts for ∼31% of the Pedersen conductance."

A growing portfolio of satellite data products is available to support this transition. Satellite data complement other information sources to provide a more complete picture of the global energy system, often with continuous spatial coverage over targeted areas or even the entire Earth. We find that satellite data are already being applied to a wide range of energy issues with varying information needs, from planning and operation of renewable energy projects, to tracking changing patterns in energy access and use, to monitoring environmental impacts and verifying the effectiveness of emissions reduction efforts. While satellite data could play a larger role throughout the policy and planning lifecycle, there are technical, social, and structural barriers to their increased use. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for satellite data applications to energy and recommendations for research to maximize the value of satellite data for sustainable energy transitions."

The purpose of this research is to obtain data at P-band for the dielectric constant of seawater that can be combined with previous L-band data for developing a model function valid from 500 MHz to 2000 MHz.  A transmission-type cylindrical cavity has   been   constructed   with   the   TM010   mode   resonance   occurring near 700 MHz.  The seawater is introduced via a capillary quartz tube. The dimensions of the cavity have been determined by electromagnetic modelling.  The model takes the cavity wall loss into account and can provide accurate estimation of resonance condition for both the empty cavity and cavity with seawater. The errors between the theory and measurement are about 0.07% for the resonant frequency and 0.4%   for   the quality   factor, Q.   The   cavity   design, experimental   setup   and   measurement   schedule   will   be   presented in the paper."

processes from the corona out through the extent of the heliosphere, and provide insight into processes of particle acceleration and transport that are widely applicable in astrophysics. From the operations perspective, SEP events pose a radiation hazard for aviation, electronics in space, and human space exploration, in particular for missions outside of the Earth’s protective magnetosphere including to the Moon and Mars. Thus, it is critical to improve the scientific understanding of SEP events and use this understanding to develop and
improve SEP forecasting capabilities to support operations. Many SEP models exist or are in development using a wide variety of
approaches and with differing goals. These include computationally intensive physics-based models, fast and light empirical models,
machine learning-based models, and mixed-model approaches. The aim of this paper is to summarize all of the SEP models currently
developed in the scientific community, including a description of model approach, inputs and outputs, free parameters, and any published

Its payload consists of three instruments, a primary hyperspectral imaging radiometer being built at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and two multispectral, multiangle polarimeters, the combination of which advances far beyond heritage capabilities. The Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) offers one-day global coverage with a ground sample distance of 1 km2 at nadir. As described in this OceanShot, this leap in technology will enable improved understanding of aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemistry, as well as provide new information on phytoplankton community composition and improved detection of algal blooms.

OCI will be complemented by two small multi-angle polarimeters with spectral ranges that span the visible to near infrared spectral region. When sunlight interacts with clouds or aerosols, it comes away from that interaction changed. By measuring changes in how reflected light oscillates within a geometric plane (i.e., its viewing angle-specific polarization), we can infer useful properties of the clouds or aerosols. This information is crucial to deciphering the way sunlight is reflected and absorbed by our planet and how aerosols affect cloud formation. The polarimeters include the Spectro-polarimeter for Planetary Exploration (SPEXone) and the Hyper Angular Research Polarimeter (HARP2), both of which will significantly improve aerosol and cloud characterizations and provide opportunities for novel ocean color atmospheric correction. (Figure 3). These instruments offer complementary capabilities: SPEXone is hyperspectral, multiangular, and narrow swath to support advanced atmospheric aerosol characterizations, whereas HARP2 is multispectral, hyper-angular, and wide swath to advance cloud property retrievals. In total, the combined PACE instrument suite will revolutionize studies of global biogeochemistry, carbon cycles, and air–sea exchanges in the ocean–atmosphere system."

We applied this new catalog of well-vetted disk candidates to search for new members of nearby young stellar associations (YSAs) using a novel technique based on Gaia data and virtual reality (VR). We examined AB Doradus, Argus, β Pictoris, Carina, Columba, Octans-Near, Tucana–Horologium, and TW Hya by displaying them in VR together with other nearby stars, color coded to show infrared excesses found via Disk Detective. Using this method allows us to find new association members in mass regimes where isochrones are degenerate. We propose 10 new YSA members with infrared excesses: three of AB Doradus (HD 44775, HD 40540 and HD 44510), one of β Pictoris (HD 198472), two of Octans-Near (HD 157165 and BD+35 2953), and four disk-hosting members of a combined population of Carina, Columba, and Tucana–Horologium: CPD-57 937, HD 274311, HD 41992, and WISEA J092521.90-673224.8. This last object (J0925) appears to be an extreme debris disk with a fractional infrared luminosity of 3.7 × 10−2. We also propose two new members of AB Doradus that do not show infrared excesses: TYC 6518-1857-1 and CPD-25 1292. We find HD 15115 appears to be a member of Tucana–Horologium rather than β Pictoris. We advocate for membership in Columba–Carina of HD 30447, CPD-35 525, and HD 35841. Finally, we propose that three M dwarfs, previously considered members of Tucana–Horologium are better considered a separate association, tentatively called ""Smethells 165."""

We investigated the evolution of the ozone enhancement from analysis of meteorological data, backward trajectories, and model sensitivity experiments. In spring, air masses over Hanoi exhibit strong height dependence. At 3km, the high-ozone air masses originate from the land area to the west of Hanoi, while low-ozone air masses below about 1.5 km are from the oceanic area to the east. Above 4 km, the air masses are mostly traced back to the farther west area. The chemical transport model simulations revealed that precursor emissions from biomass burning in the inland Indochina Peninsula have the largest contribution to the lower  tropospheric ozone enhancement, which is transported upward and eastward and overhangs the clean air intrusion from the ocean to the east of Hanoi. At this height level, the polluted air has the horizontal extent of about 20 degrees in longitude and latitude. The polluted air observed in Hanoi is transported further east and widely spread over the northern Pacific Ocean."

However, while soil moisture has been globally well-validated, VOD validation has been sparse. Furthermore, simultaneously retrieval of these parameters results in uncertainties both individually in soil moisture and VOD retrievals as well as in compensation between the parameters. Here, we show global locations where soil moisture and VOD retrievals will have lower uncertainty, based on complementary brightness temperature information content and signal-to-noise ratio metrics. In these same locations, we show that error still propagates more into VOD. However, using VOD regularization algorithms, this error is greatly reduced, especially at sub-weekly timescales where algorithmic error can be most apparent. Despite these regularization approaches that reduce errors, there are yet vast differences in available global regularized retrievals originating from different algorithmic choices."

Sodium is a moderately volatile element that is a lithophile, which can be utilized as a tracer of the volatile history in planetary bodies. It is also well observed in the exosphere of several bodies in our solar system and exoplanetary systems. But lunar surface sodium abundances have so far been measured only in samples brought back to Earth. We report on results from the first effort to provide a global-scale measurement of sodium on the lunar surface using X-ray fluorescent spectra from Chandrayaan-2. A global average of 1.33 ± 0.03 wt% derived here is higher than previously known. Trends in the sodium abundance indicate a long-lived adsorbate component that could explain the higher abundances reported here, which would act as a reservoir that sustains the lunar sodium exosphere."

The switchbacks’ formation mechanism and sources are still unresolved, although candidate mechanisms include Alfvénic turbulence, shear-driven Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities, interchange reconnection, and geometrical effects related to the Parker spiral. This Letter presents observations from the Metis coronagraph on board a Solar Orbiter of a single large propagating S-shaped vortex, interpreted as the first evidence of a switchback in the solar corona. It originated above an active region with the related loop system bounded by open-field regions to the east and west. Observations, modeling, and theory provide strong arguments in favor of the interchange reconnection origin of switchbacks. Metis measurements suggest that the initiation of the switchback may also be an indicator of the origin of slow solar wind."

While their precise production mechanisms are still unknown, the two main theories are via interchange reconnection events and in situ generation. In this work, density and abundance variations of alpha particles are studied inside and outside individual switchbacks. We find no consistent compositional differences in the alpha particle abundance ratio, nαp, inside versus outside switchbacks, nor do we observe any signature when separating the switchbacks according to Vαp/Vpw, the ratio of the alpha–proton differential speed to the wave phase speed (the speed at which the switchback is traveling). We argue that these measurements cannot be used to rule in favor of one production mechanism over the other, due to the distance between PSP and the postulated interchange reconnection events. In addition, we examine the 3D velocity fluctuations of protons and alpha particles within individual switchbacks. While switchbacks are always associated with increases in proton velocity, alpha velocities may be enhanced, unchanged, or decrease. This is due to the interplay between Vpw and Vαp, with the Alfvénic motion of the alpha particles vanishing as the difference |Vpw – Vαp| decreases. We show how the Alfvénic motion of both the alphas and the protons through switchbacks can be understood as an approximately rigid arm rotation about the location of the wave frame, and illustrate that the wave frame can therefore be estimated using particle measurements alone, via sphere fitting."

We compared DESIS and Hyperion surface reflectance magnitude and variability at a pseudo-invariant site (PICS) and a vegetated flux site (VFS). VNIR reflectance magnitudes between the two sensors did not significantly differ at the PICS. However, DESIS variability was higher, likely due to differences in the data acquisition time and observation geometry. Using empirical and biophysical models, both DESIS and Hyperion datasets captured the seasonal variations in gross primary production (GPP) and canopy bio-physical parameters such as chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), and senescent material at the VFS. Differences in the magnitudes of the bio-physical parameters were observed, likely due to the differences in the sensors spectral range and resolution. Using VNIR reflectance from EO-1 Hyperion with DESIS convolved to Hyperion spectral resolution to estimate canopy chlorophyll and GPP, we demonstrate that combining historic and current space-based reflectance data in a common multi-sensor approach is feasible. This is of importance for extending the reflectance record established with EO-1 Hyperion to provide continuity with the current orbital instruments (e.g., DESIS/ISS, PRISMA/ASI) and the forthcoming NASA Surface Biology and Geology (SBG), ESA CHIME and DLR EnMAP satellite missions, which is of key importance for comparisons of current and past trends in the seasonal dynamics of vegetation traits and photosynthetic function."

During its singular observed outburst in 2009–2010, the black hole X-ray binary XTE J1752−223 spent ∼1 month in a long-stable hard spectral state at a luminosity of ∼0.02–0.1 L<sub>Edd</sub>. It was observed with 56 RXTE pointings during this period, with simultaneous Swift-XRT daily coverage during the first 10 days of the RXTE observations. While reflection modeling has been extensively explored in the analysis of these data, there is disagreement surrounding the geometry of the accretion disk and corona implied by the reflection features. We reexamine the combined, high signal-to-noise, simultaneous Swift and RXTE observations, and perform extensive reflection modeling with the latest relxill suite of reflection models, including newer high disk density models. We show that reflection modeling requires that the disk be within ∼5 R<sub>ISCO</sub> during the hard spectral state, while weaker constraints from the thermal disk emission imply higher truncation (Rin = 6–80 R<sub>ISCO</sub>). We also explore more complex coronal continuum models, allowing for two Comptonization components instead of one, and show that the reflection features still require only a mildly truncated disk. Finally we present a full comparison of our results to previous constraints found from analyses of the same data set."

This paper provides a projection of the specific power and efficiency of power converters, (AC-DC, DC-AC, or DC-DC), through the year 2050. Data was first collected on state of the art power converters in multiple application areas, creating a power converter database. Relevant specific powers were added to a set of historical data from 1976-2020, and then three different logistic curves were fit through the historical data to represent S-curve shaped growth through the year 2050. The three curves were differentiated by conservative, nominal, and aggressive assumptions for the year in which the logistic curve begins to bend down towards slower growth. With a 30% knockdown factor accounting for the additional weight required for a high altitude converter, projections range from the aggressive specific power projection of 52.9 kW/kg in 2050 to a much more conservative specific power of 12 kW/kg in which growth is limited due to certifiability concerns. Little historical data was found on converter efficiencies to project efficiency based on historical trends. Projections are based on expert opinion on yearly decreases in converter losses. 2050 projections range from 0.987 to 0.997."

Comparison of observed resonant line profiles with CMFGEN model profiles allows separation of wind–wind collision and shell absorptions from the primary wind P Cygni profiles. The dissipating occulter preferentially obscured the central binary and interacting winds relative to the very extended primary wind. We are now able to monitor changes in the colliding winds with orbital phase. High-velocity transient absorptions occurred across the most recent periastron passage, indicating acceleration of the primary wind by the secondary wind, which leads to a downstream, high-velocity bow shock that is newly generated every orbital period. There is no evidence of changes in the properties of the binary winds."

Arc-jets are often used to evaluate important design factors that include heat shield materials and vehicle design. Characterization of these facilities is important, as studies often aim to match specific in-flight environments during experiments. Due to the complex environment produced by an arc-jet, with effects such as thermodynamic and chemical non-equilibrium occurring in the flow, characterization experiments are significantly more difficult than in conventional blow-down wind tunnels. The current work aims to characterize an arc-jet facility through spatially-resolved measurements of flow unsteadiness, temperature, and velocity. To achieve this goal, a non-intrusive imaging technique called “planar laser-induced fluorescence” was performed in the NASA Langley Hypersonic Materials Environmental Test System arc-jet facility. The experimental data was analysed to produce the quantitative measurements in multiple regions of the flow around a blunt body specimen. A three-temperature low fidelity numerical solver was created to simulate the flow in order to investigate thermal non-equilibrium effects occurring outside the imaging region in the arc-jet nozzle. Unsteadiness in the test section of the arc-jet was minimized by analyzing a subset of data assessing the gas injection configuration. Radial velocity, rotational temperature and translational temperature measurements are provided that can be used to validate future computational studies. The temperature measurements revealed rotational non-equilibrium occurring behind the bow-shock near the specimen surface. Computational results show the facility is capable of producing thermal non-equilibrium flow in the arc-jet nozzle. This work provides the first experimental and computational evidence of thermal trans-rotational non-equilibrium occurring in multiple regions of this arc-jet facility. Significant improvements to the methodology are also identified as recommendations for future arc-jet characterization studies."

We assessed the efficacy of polychromatic short-wavelength-enriched light to improve vigilant attention, alertness and mood immediately after waking from slow-wave sleep at night. Twelve participants (six female, 23.3 ± 4.2 years) maintained an actigraphy-confirmed sleep schedule of 8.5 hr for 5 nights, and 5 hr for 1 night prior to an overnight laboratory visit. In the laboratory, participants were awakened from slow-wave sleep, and immediately exposed to either dim, red ambient light (control) or polychromatic short-wavelength-enriched light (light) for 1 hr in a randomized crossover design. They completed a 5-min Psychomotor Vigilance Task, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, and Visual Analogue Scales of mood at 2, 17, 32 and 47 min after waking. Following this testing period, lights were turned off and participants returned to sleep. They were awakened from their subsequent slow-wave sleep period and received the opposite condition. Compared with the control condition, participants exposed to light had fewer Psychomotor Vigilance Task lapses (χ<sup>2</sup>[1] = 5.285, p = 0.022), reported feeling more alert (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale: F<sub>1,77</sub> = 4.955, p = 0.029; Visual Analogue Scale<sub>alert</sub>: F<sub>1,77</sub> = 8.226, p = 0.005), and reported improved mood (Visual Analogue Scale<sub>cheerful</sub>: F<sub>1,77</sub> = 8.615, p = 0.004). There was no significant difference in sleep-onset latency between conditions following the testing period (t<sub>10</sub> = 1.024, p = 0.330). Our results suggest that exposure to polychromatic short-wavelength-enriched light immediately after waking from slow-wave sleep at night may help improve vigilant attention, subjective alertness, and mood.

Yet there remains significant uncertainty about the mangrove change trajectories and the drivers of change at national scales. In Colombia, the absence of historical satellite imagery and persistent cloud cover have impeded the accurate mapping of mangrove extent and change over time. We create a temporally consistent Landsat-derived dataset using the LandTrendr algorithm to track the historical land cover and mangrove conversion from 1984-2020 across Colombia. Over this period, mangrove extent decreased by ~48.000ha (14% of total mangrove area). We find a gradual reduction of mangrove extent along the Pacific coast since 2004, whereas, in the Caribbean, mangrove cover declined around during 1984-1988 and also after 2012. Our time-series analysis matches with drivers of mangrove change at three local sites. For instance, hydroclimatic events, dredging activities, and high sediment loads transported by the rivers have collectively improved mangrove recovery in some sites. In contrast, human activities pressure linked to agricultural expansion and road construction have degraded mangroves. The transition from dense mangrove to other vegetation types is the most significant conversion affecting mangrove cover in Colombia, impacting an area of 38,469 ± 2,829 ha. We anticipate increased mangrove loss, especially along the Pacific coast, resulting from intensified human activity. Prioritization of conservation areas is needed to support local institutions, maintain currently protected areas, and develop strategies (e.g. payment for ecosystem services) to preserve one of the most pristine mangrove regions in the Western Hemisphere."

However, several key questions and uncertainties remain with these assessments. Here we used results from an ensemble of 19 state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation models from the TRENDYv9 project to improve these estimates and study the drivers of its interannual variability. Our results show that North America has been a C sink with a magnitude of 0.37 ± 0.38 (mean and one standard deviation) PgC year−1 for the period 2000–2019 (0.31 and 0.44 PgC year−1 in each decade); split into 0.18 ± 0.12 PgC year−1 in Canada (0.15 and 0.20), 0.16 ± 0.17 in the United States (0.14 and 0.17), 0.02 ± 0.05 PgC year−1 in Mexico (0.02 and 0.02) and 0.01 ± 0.02 in Central America and the Caribbean (0.01 and 0.01). About 57% of the new C assimilated by terrestrial ecosystems is allocated into vegetation, 30% into soils, and 13% into litter. Losses of C due to fire account for 41% of the interannual variability of the mean net biome productivity for all North America in the model ensemble. Finally, we show that drought years (e.g., 2002) have the potential to shift the region to a small net C source in the simulations (−0.02 ± 0.46 PgC year−1). Our results highlight the importance of identifying the major drivers of the interannual variability of the continental-scale land C cycle along with the spatial distribution of local sink-source dynamics."

Monitoring the tool wear online is vital to prevent degradation in machining quality. However, direct real-time tool wear measurement is not practical. This paper presents residual-based anomaly detection models, combining a hybrid model comprised of a physics-based model and a data-driven model (a decision tree or a neural network) to predict signals of interest (e.g., power or forces) under nominal conditions, followed by Page’s cumulative sum test for detecting tool wear on-line using the computer numerical control machine measurements. The most informative features are ranked using dynamic programming and its approximation variants from real-time measurements and machine settings, such as the width of cut, depth of cut, feed rate and spindle speed, that serve as inputs to the predictive models. The baseline nominal model is incrementally updated with experimental data via a gradient boosted adaptation model to generate the residuals that account for discrepancies between the actual machine data under normal conditions and the baseline nominal model predictions. The hybrid model is validated against 20 Mazak milling machine experimental tests and one Haas run-to-failure experiment. The proposed anomaly detector is applied to synthetic data from simulations of the physics-based model at different operating conditions, measurement noise levels, and tool wear levels, and the methods were able to achieve an overall 92% accuracy in data with 1% noise. The anomaly detection methods based on hybrid model reduced the false alarms of either the data-driven or physical-based models alone, and are found to be capable of good online detection of tool wear."

Characterization of directly imaged exoplanets is one of the most eagerly anticipated science functions of the <i>James Webb Space Telescope</i>. MIRI, the mid-IR instrument, has the capability to provide unique spatially resolved photometric data points in a spectral range never before achieved for such objects.

<i>Aims</i>. We aim to present the very first on-sky contrast measurements of the MIRI coronagraphs. In addition to a classical Lyot coronagraph at the longest wavelength, this observing mode implements the concept of the four-quadrant phase mask for the very first time in a space telescope.

<i>Methods</i>. We observed single stars together with a series of reference stars to measure raw contrasts as they are delivered on the detector, as well as reference-subtracted contrasts.

<i>Results</i>. The MIRI coronagraphs achieve raw contrasts better than 10<sup>−3</sup> at the smallest angular separations (within 1″) and about 10<sup>−5</sup> farther out (beyond 5 ~ 6″). Subtracting the residual diffracted light left behind the coronagraph has the potential to bring the final contrast down to the background- and detector-limited noise floor at most angular separations (a few times 10<sup>−5</sup> at less than 1″).

<i>Conclusions</i>. The MIRI coronagraphs behave as expected from simulations. In particular, the raw contrasts for all four coronagraphs are fully consistent with the diffractive model. Contrasts obtained by subtracting reference stars also meet expectations and are fully demonstrated for two four-quadrant phase masks (F1065C and F1140C). The worst contrast, measured at F1550C, is very likely due to a variation in the phase aberrations at the primary mirror during the observations, and not an issue with the coronagraph itself. We did not perform reference star subtraction with the Lyot mask at F2300C, but we anticipate that it would bring the contrast down to the noise floor."

Together,these data products can be used to enable safe and preciselanding on celestial bodies for which a priori orbital reconnaissanceis insufficient for hazard detection and avoidance.Unlike camera images used in visual terrain relative navigation,LiDAR scans are insensitive to changes in illumination; as aresult, the technique can be used to land in poorly lit areas,or at times of day when the lighting conditions are incongruentwith existing orbital imagery. In this paper, we extend previouswork in which we introduced a factor graph based smoothingapproach for LiDAR-inertial navigation and mapping. Whereasthe algorithms were previously tested on simulated data, thispaper presents testing on real-world data. Data from theAutonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT)airplane flight tests in the Yucca Flats and Death Valley in2009 (FT3), the Morpheus vertical take off and landing flighttests at Kennedy Space Center in 2014 (FT6), and the landingof Perseverance and Ingenuity on Mars in 2021 (M2020) wereused to evaluate algorithm performance. In this paper, weextend our LiDAR-inertial technique to work with a variety ofranging technologies: single point laser altimetry (FT3), denseflash LiDAR (FT6), and six-beam radar (M2020). A thoroughperformance analysis for all three datasets is presented. Datasetpreparation, improvements in algorithm robustness, and outlierrejection, which were necessitated by the transition to realworlddata, are discussed."

Immediately after the successful landing of Mars 2020 Perseverance rover at Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021, the rover autonomously initiated mission critical commanding necessary to transition the vehicle from a Cruise/EDL to Surface operations configuration. This began the surface operations commissioning phase, referred to as Surface Operations Transition (SOX). The objective of SOX phase is to establish vehicle health and safety and to verify that the operational characteristics of the vehicle, now operating in the Martian environment, are as-expected and safe to proceed into nominal operations. The SOX commissioning phase is organized into six logical sub-phases occurring in the following chronological order; (1) SOX1a, (2) FSW Transition, (3) SOX1b, (4) SOX2a, (5) Heli, (6) SOX2b. In total, the SOX commissioning phase was expected to take up-to 111 sols (Martian days). The Perseverance rover is an extremely complex, highly-integrated, robotic system-of-systems that requires numerous activities to incrementally and methodically verify their safe operations. This paper will discuss the development process used to plan, test, and execute the SOX commissioning phase for Mars 2020 Perseverance rover surface operations. We will discuss key challenges associated with SOX development as well as actual operations execution experience."

This technology addresses a need for more aggressive sampling and drilling techniques, for both scientific purposes and to obtain In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) resources for future NASA missions and human crew support. Using a spool of lightweight, high-pressure capillary, a DTH drill assembly would be moved in and out of the hole that could be a kilometer or more in depth. The CO2 drill is designed so that Mars atmospheric CO2 could be collected, compressed, and supplied down the hole and routed through microducts, valves, and reservoirs for the purpose of controlling miniature mechanical actuation in the assembly. By using compressed CO2, the drill system avoids the need for heavy electrical cabling and actuator systems or a liquid media for carrying away particulates as is typically used in terrestrial drilling systems. Instead, the liquid CO2 that powers the drill expands to a gas and could be channeled around the drill housing to carry cuttings to be collected in a bailing bucket. Where terrestrial systems often use drill depth vs time as a metric, a Mars drilling system would need to be extremely low mass, but would have no need to perform under tight schedules. In this paper, we will document our trade studies, progression for the design of microduct logic verified through multiple generations of prototypes, and provide predictive performance data on energy consumption, hole depth, and drill time."

It carried with it a technologydemonstration, the Ingenuity helicopter, which hasdemonstrated the first controlled, powered flight on anotherplanet. This paper describes how an iconic, April 2021 imageof the Perseverance rover with the Ingenuity helicopter wasdesigned and executed as the rover was getting ready todeploy the helicopter. WATSON is a camera mounted at theend of the rover’s robotic arm and was used to acquire theself-portrait. WATSON is designed to take close up picturesof rocks and regolith on Mars but can also provide views ofthe terrain. A single image covers a small portion of thescene. In order to a create a mosaic covering the full roverand helicopter, 62 WATSON images were acquired. To allowthe images to be mosaicked together, the camera needs to bekept in the same spot. The robotic arm has five degrees offreedom for motion; small changes in orientation can requiresignificant repositioning of the robotic arm joints. Todocument this, a movie of the arm motion was acquired bythe rover’s mast-mounted left navigation camera pointed atthe WATSON and robotic arm while it was simultaneouslymoving to acquire the selfie. For the first time, we alsocaptured the sound of the arm motion as it was acquiring theselfie. In the case of the Perseverance selfie with the Ingenuity helicopter, we also had to think about how toposition the rover with respect to the helicopter and fit theselfie acquisition into the helicopter prime mission timeline.This paper also describes the history of NASA Mars roverselfies."

During each closest approach, called perijove, the spacecraft comes within 4,000 km of the cloud tops and the motion of the spacecraft becomes perturbed by the gravitational field of Jupiter. These small changes in the motion of the spacecraft are detected using the Juno Gravity Science Instrument by measuring the Doppler shift of the radio link between the Juno spacecraft and NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN). During a majority of these closest approach passes, the 34-meter DSS-25 antenna transmits simultaneous X-band and Ka-band uplink to the spacecraft. Juno’s onboard X-band transponder and Ka-band translator phase-coherently return the signals back to Earth for reception at the same DSS-25 antenna. The precise frequency of these signals is measured by processing open-loop recordings of the signal. These measurements, characterized by ~5-10 micron/sec accuracies (after calibration of charged particle noise and Earth troposphere), have probed the gravity field of Jupiter to unprecedented precision, allowing for discoveries of Jupiter’s core size and depth of the zonal winds. Successful operations of the instrument during perijoves requires careful planning and coordination between DSN engineers, the Juno project, and the Juno science team. This work discusses the operations of the Juno Gravity Science Instrument after five years of prime mission operations. Lessons learned are documented to be applied to future missions and the Juno extended mission. Although the Juno extended mission formally started on August 1, 2021, on June 7, 2021, the trajectory was modified with a flyby of Ganymede, the third Galilean moon of Jupiter. Gravity and radio science investigations of Jupiter and its moons will continue to play a key role in Juno’s objectives during the extended mission."

This new phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) has density 10 $\cmv \le n(e) \le$ 100 $\cmv$, and has effectively been identified throughout much of the Milky Way and in nearby galaxies. :The unexpected conditiosn in the D-WIM immediately raise important questions both about this phase of the ISM and its relationship to the ISM as a while. These include: what is the structure of the D-WIM -- e.g. filling factor, distribution, and morphology?; what is the origin of the D-WIM?; what supports its ionization and what is its evolution given huge overpressure relative to the $\ge$ 100 times more diffuse Warm Ionized Medium (WIM)?; what is its possible relationship to stars - is it the the remnants of very old HII regions that were produced by clusters of masive stars? The PRIMA survey requires a coverage of a large fraction of the plane, plus selected regions at high galactic latitudes. A sensitivity of 10$^{-9}$ $Wm^{-2}sr^{-1}$ would be highly desirable. A spectral resolution $R$ of 10$^4$ will isolate individual spectral features. $R$ = 10$^3$ would be acceptable to measure the total intensity. This PRIMA survey could be part of a broader survey of the ISM, and include a number of other important ISM tracers such as [CII] 158 \um, [OI] 63 \um\ and [OI] 146 \um, depending on wavelength coverage of the instrument. The sensitivity requirement for study of the D-WIM is likely more stringent than for the other lines, and may require special consideration for successful implementation as well as for determining the area that can be observed."

To fully resolve these openquestions, scientists need a closer look at an interstellar objectvia a dedicated spacecraft and close approach. However, ISOspose unique engineering challenges for close encounters becauseof their extremely high relative velocity, unfavorable approachgeometry, and limited alert time; ISOs often are only discovereda few months before a spacecraft would need to launch toencounter it.Typical encounters with small bodies have occurred at relativevelocities on the order of 10 km/s with approach phase below90 deg (at least half-lit). Except for the Halley Armada in the80s, the most extreme flybys have been of comet Borrelly ata relative velocity of 16.6 km/s (but only a phase angle of 65deg) and Annefrank at a phase angle of 150 deg (but a relativevelocity of only 7.2 km/s). Furthermore, planetary missionsgenerally target bodies whose ephemerides are well constrainedbecause of many years of Earth based observations. On theother hand, ISOs typically have relative velocities of 30-90 km/s,phase angles biased towards over 90 deg, and larger positionuncertainties because of shorter ground-based observationalarcs, and thus represent much more difficult targets.Our team has been developing the flight system architecturesand technologies necessary to enable future reconnaissance ofan interstellar object by flyby, potentially including an impactor.This endeavor seeks to catalyze planetary exploration and itsintersection with exo-planet science.

The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is engaged at three separate experiment sites to improve its SM retrieval algorithm in forested areas. Two of the sites are located in the deciduous forest region in Massachusetts and New York, US and one is located in southern boreal forest zone in Saskatchewan, Canada. Each site has a SM measurement network of about 20 stations spread out over an area of about 30 km, which covers the SMAP radiometer footprint. In 2022, intensive observations will be carried out at each site which involve deployments of an airborne instrument, which is similar to the SMAP instrument, and intensive manual measurements of SM, surface and vegetation. The measurements also include tower-based radiometer observations with ground truth measurements within the instrument footprint. Here we show some early results using the networks and SMAP measurements to analyze the sensitivity of the SMAP L-band measurements to SM changes in forested area and the impact of the vegetation to the signal. The results suggest an upper limit for vegetation attenuation accounting for surface roughness effect and relate that to the values used in the current SMAP SM products."

NASA’s Psyche Mission plans to host the DSOC flight subsystem for testing space-to-ground high-bandwidth laser communications en route to the 16 Psyche asteroid.  We review the design, performance, and qualification of the LTA Engineering Model and Flight Model (EM and FM) delivered to JPL. The LTA uses a master-oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) design and delivers up to 4.5 W at 1550 nm, with a highly efficient, cladding-pumped, polarization-maintaining erbium-ytterbium fiber amplifier. The master oscillator generates a range of pulse widths and repetition rates to support modulation formats from 16- to 128-PPM for optical data transmission at >100 Mbps. The LTA was designed for high reliability and radiation hardness, and includes redundant signal and pumping paths to reduce single points of failure, hardware interlocks to ensure safe operation and protection against damage, closed-loop control of optical power, and detailed health and status via telemetry. The LTA EM and FM were subjected to unit-appropriate space qualification testing. We describe the performance testing of the EM and FM, for the characterization of key metrics such as wavelength stability, signal linewidth, optical pulse width, jitter, and extinction ratio, and polarization extinction ratio. The management of optical nonlinearities (self-phase modulation, Brillouin scattering, or pulse-to-pulse energy variation), which could result in an optical link penalty or damage to the LTA, is also detailed, and factors affecting the power efficiency are discussed."

The Blue Box architecture is centered around COTS motor controllers and COTS input-output modules communicating over an EtherCAT bus. A custom, low-level safety subsystem ensures no harm can be done to the flight articles. The modular architecture of the EGSE reduces cost and complexity while expediting assembly time. The Blue Box drives the 19 actuators of the SCS which span the main robotic arm, the corer system, the internal sample handling arm, the sample tube sealing system and the gas dust removal tool; mimicking the Rover Motor Control Assembly (RMCA). Due to the limited availability of RMCA’s, the EGSE enabled and performed the bulk of testing activities for SCS. The majority of the SCS actuators are composed of a 3-phase DC brushless motors, hall sensors for commutation, dual resolvers for output angular measurement, brakes, heaters and platinum thermistors. Additionally, the EGSE read 12 strain gauges forming part of a force torque sensor, and switches used for external positioning references. Over the 3-year span of the V&V campaign for the SCS, over 32 EGSE systems were built, tested and deployed to test venues at JPL and externally. The EGSE tested several families of the SCS subsystem, ranging from engineering units, life test units and two flight units. Test venues that this EGSE supported included lab benches, ultra-clean cleanrooms, ATLO facilities, and thermal vacuum chambers. Together with the test software systems, SSDEV and SSDEV-ECAT, the Blue Box EGSE enabled the team to efficiently test flight hardware and flight software together. We go over the safety features and fault management techniques employed to protect flight hardware. The effects of the long, 50-feet, EGSE harnesses on motor performance, EMI, electrical noise, and motor control performance are explained. Mitigations to these unwanted effects, including shielding strategy and inductance compensation, are summarized. We go over an excerpt of notable anomalies that this EGSE suffered through its operation, along with investigations and resolutions. Lessons learned, areas of improvement as part of future work, and recommendations for future implementations for similar EGSE’s, are shared."

Charging is especially severe in certain earth orbits such as geostationary orbit, medium earth orbit and highly inclined orbit. A spacecraft that travels to other planets such as Jupiter also encounters high level of charging due to Jupiter’s radiation belt. The major concern for spacecraft operation due to charging is the survival of sensitive electrical circuits. Dielectrics and floating metal can charge up and discharge onto interface circuits. The electrical circuits need to be evaluated for survival from the electrostatic-discharge (ESD) threat. Both ESD induced upset and damage need to be assessed. The interface circuits are often located inside a shielded unit in the spacecraft structure or a shielded vault with sufficient radiation shielding to avoid surface and internal charging. The materials external to the highly shielded area can charge up and discharge onto wires that can directly dissipate the ESD onto the interface circuits. 	Figure 1 shows a possible discharge mechanism onto the interfacing circuits. If the wire has an external shield or a coaxial line, some or most of the discharge can flow on the shield to chassis ground. There is always coupling from external discharge. If the wire has no shield, the discharge flows onto the interface circuit.  Fig. 1	Possible discharge paths onto the interface circuits. 	The purpose of this article is to address how to model the ESD threat to be used as the discharge source onto the interface circuit based on the electron beam test data. Different models are needed for different impedances associated with the interface circuits. Once those models are derived, one needs to analyze the interface circuit with the corresponding model using an electrical simulation tool. Then, the circuit’s front-end components can be assessed for damage and upset. Upset is highly dependent on the circuit operation and system requirements, and thus it is not addressed any further. Damage of electrical parts is often rated under Human-Body-Model (HBM) ESD. One can utilize this industry-wide available information to assess the damage vulnerability due to space discharges. However, the HBM waveform does not always match the discharge waveform. To estimate the damage vulnerability of the circuit and set margin, one needs to compare the equivalent energy delivered to the victim between a HBM discharge and the results from an ESD source model based on actual discharges. This paper presents such a comparison for a few select cases."

Validating autonomy, therefore, is a matter of validating that the system makes intelligent decisions even when there might be discrepancies between the observed and the expected state of the world as well as when the possible outcome of each of the possible courses of action is uncertain. During the requirements engineering phase, the functions, including those that are required to be autonomous and their expected behavior are specified. However, in the case of autonomous software system, it is challenging to specify all possible scenarios that the software may encounter. Additionally, since autonomous behaviors cannot always be fully predetermined, it is difficult to reason about their completeness and correctness. While these challenges are also faced with non-autonomous system, they are more prevalent for autonomous system due to their complexity and emergent behavior. Our efforts have been three-fold. On one hand, we have developed a goal-based method for requirements decomposition. We have embedded this approach into a higher-level systems engineering framework and then developed methods for decision and reliability analysis within this framework. And finally, we use simulation analysis to validate the more theoretical methods and provide a feedback mechanism.  The decision analysis approach (DA) helps in identifying and mitigating the run-time risks, by bringing to the forefront the uncertainties, decisions, interactions, and other factors that may cause autonomous software to make erroneous decisions. The DA framework is used to quantify, for each decision that the software can make, failure risk due to uncertainties. The information about the key decisions and circumstances that can cause autonomous system to make incorrect decisions are used to generate test scenarios to be run in a simulator to ensure that the system can handle error-prone circumstances. The results or outcomes from decisions, based on the simulated scenarios, can then be leveraged to further gain insight of the assured system.  We combine a goal-based approach with simulation analysis to facilitate requirements development for autonomous systems and further provide a method for run-time systems level reliability considerations during the autonomous software development process. The DA and the reliability analysis methods provide a formalism for the consideration of uncertainty in the run time decision-making process for autonomous software. This formalism considers the uncertainty involved in the outcome of different courses of action, in terms of performance and cost, as well as a method to consider the system level reliability implications. System level reliability considerations for autonomous software decision making contribute to the satisfaction of the system level goals over the lifecycle of a given mission. We demonstrate our approach using a hypothetical rover path planning example. The requirements for our rover simulator are based on existing literature about Mars rovers and lessons learned from real world observations at JPL. The specifics of the autonomy design for the Mars rovers, that have not been previously cleared for external release, are not used for our demonstrations."

Triton’s physical and orbital characteristics make it a unique planetary target for scientific exploration, providing opportunities for investigations in a wide variety of scientific fields, including geomorphological, atmospheric, geophysical, magnetospheric, and ionospheric studies. The science objectives of the Trident mission encompassed an in-depth interior-to-exterior set of objectives, focused on multiple outstanding questions resulting from the 1989 encounter of Voyager 2, and subsequent analysis.Ball Aerospace Corp. was tasked with building the Trident spacecraft, with JPL responsible for providing Engineering Support (Mission Design & Navigation, Mission Planning, Flight Operations, Ground Data Systems, Systems Engineering) and leading Project Management. The observatory would carry a wide-ranging suite of scientific instruments onboard, including an Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) and Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) to be provided by Ball Aerospace Corp., a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) from JPL, a Magnetometer from UCLA, a contributed Plasma Science Suite from IRF (Sweden), and a contributed Radio Science instrument from ASI (Italy). All of these instruments would be used to collect unique datasets during the Triton encounter. Trident would have taken advantage of an ~13-yr, nearly-ballistic trajectory to Triton, utilizing a timely Jupiter Gravity Assist, to execute a 10-day long encounter in the Neptunian system. Launch was planned for October 2025, with Triton arrival scheduled for December 2038. The timeline for this mission would have been sub-divided into seven major phases: Launch, Commissioning, Inner Planet Cruise, Outer Planet Cruise, Approach, Encounter, and Science Data Return. Multiple planetary flybys were planned to be performed during the cruise, including three Earth flybys and one Venus flyby in the Inner Planet Cruise phase, and one Jupiter flyby in the Outer Planet Cruise phase. Along with conventional (Range and Doppler) tracking data, Delta-DOR and Optical Navigation data were also to be acquired to assist with spacecraft navigation during the Approach and Encounter phases. A 3 meter X-Band High Gain Antenna would allow playback of all science data at 1 kbps within 1 year after the Triton Encounter. The Mission Planning element on Trident encompassed and informed multiple aspects of this proposal, ranging from science observation planning during the Triton Encounter phase, to generation of activity timelines for all mission phases; performing ground coverage analysis for science observations to be acquired by all instruments and tracing them to science requirements; evaluation of spacecraft resources including data volume stored onboard, power/energy consumption, telecom (commanding/telemetry) requirements, and overall, working at the interface of science and engineering teams on the mission.

SBG includes spaceborne measurements of hyperspectral imagery in the visible to shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5 um) and multispectral imagery in the mid and thermal infrared (3-12 um) that provide the remote sensing data needed to inform each research and applications area. High-level TIR data products include Earth surface temperature & emissivity, evapotranspiration, substrate composition, volcanic plumes, and high-temperature features. While the science, applications, and technology build on prior mission studies conducted for more than a decade, it has only been recently that a joint team of scientists and engineers from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Volcanologia (INGV), and the Istituto Nazionale Astrofisica (INAF) have developed a compelling concept for a TIR free-flyer. In this concept, the TIR instrument is an eight-band radiometer. Seven of the bands are between 3 and 12 um with an additional band at 1.65 um. The instrument’s 68.8 deg total viewing angle and the free-flyer’s 665 km operational altitude results in a ground sampling distance (GSD) of <60 m at nadir, produces a swath width of 935 km, and allows for a 2-3-day revisit time. A two-band visible and near infrared (VNIR) camera, with <30 m GSD at nadir and 935 km swath width, will complement the TIR instrument. VNIR high-level data products include top & bottom of atmosphere reflectance and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI). The TIR instrument and VNIR camera will be mounted on a PLATiNO+ spacecraft, a multi-application, reconfigurable, and scalable platform. The launcher selected for the TIR free-flyer is the VEGA-C. To maximize the science and applications benefits the SBG-TIR free-flyer team are collaborating with personnel from the ESA Land Surface Temperature Monitoring mission (LSTM) as well individuals from the Thermal Infrared Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment (TRISHNA), a joint mission by CNES and ISRO. Pre-Phase A concept studies for the SBG-TIR free-flyer commenced in the spring 2021. This allows for the concept to be refined; for technical risks to be identified and mitigated, as necessary; and strategies for reducing the development schedule to be defined and assessed before conducting a NASA-ASI Mission Concept Review (MCR) in the spring of 2022 and a NASA Key Decision Point-A (KDP-A) as early as the summer of 2022. These are key milestones in being able to launch and begin operating the SBG-TIR free-flyer in the second half of the decade, so that many of the questions posed by the National Academies in the 2017 decadal survey can be answered."

Using the updated surface-based and satellite cloud data, we find that low cloud amount is not as strongly correlated with LTS, and not as sensitive to LTS, as established in the past. EIS does not provide a stronger correlation with low cloud amount than LTS over all eight regions (including the midlatitudes). Further analyzing the relationships between LTS and EIS with different types of low clouds, we find that there is a strong correlation of LTS and EIS with stratocumulus only. This explains the weaker correlation of low cloud fraction (including cumulus, stratocumulus, and stratus) to both LTS and EIS. These results also suggest the need to re-evaluate these relationships in Earth system models.

Plain Language Summary:
Low-level clouds play an important role in the global radiation budget. Low cloud amount has two established linear relationships with lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and estimated inversion strength (ETS). These two relationships are re-evaluated here using three separate observational cloud and two reanalysis datasets for three distinct but overlapping time periods. The analysis shows that the strength of the LTS and ETS relationships with low cloud amount varies, depending on the cloud data used. They have a strong relationship with stratocumulus cloud amount only."

In this work, we describe a simple method to control Halo Orbits with a single maneuver at the XZ-plane crossing for each revolution of the orbit in the Bicircular Problem. Examples of up to 500 revolutions of the Halo Orbit are controlled using this method. With optimization and adjustment of the maneuver design, the 𝚫V can be significantly reduced. The simplicity of the method and the infrequency of the maneuvers make this a good candidate for future autonomous control of libration orbits."

Experimental measurements demonstrated that magnetic forces in the pump motor contributed to significant amounts of radial loading on the bearings, potentially causing wear over long periods of operation and premature failures. The magnitude of these magnetic forces was determined for the rotor and stator separately, as well as for the rotor-stator assembly by designing various experimental setups able to recreate the pump motor without hydrodynamic bearings. Characterization of these magnetic forces led to changes in manufacturing processes and enabled selective choices of components, improving the pump motor hardware in order to meet NASA’s Europa Clipper project requirements."

To this end, this work proposes a system that performs continuous multi- resolution height map reconstruction and safe landing spot detection. Structure-from-Motion measurements are aggregated in a pyramid structure using a novel Optimal Mixture of Gaus- sians formulation that provides a comprehensive uncertainty model. Our multiresolution pyramid is built more efficiently and accurately than past work by decoupling pyramid filling from the measurement updates of different resolutions.To detect the safest landing location, after an optimized hazard segmentation, we use a mean shift algorithm on multiple distance transform peaks to account for terrain roughness and uncertainty. The benefits of our contributions are evaluated on real and synthetic flight data."

These challenges motivate an integrated approach to planning and execution that is able to respond intelligently to variation. We examine this problem in the context of the Europa Lander mission concept, and evaluate a planning and execution framework that responds to feedback and task failure using two techniques: flexible execution and replanning with plan optimization. We develop a theoretical framework to estimate gains from these techniques, and we compare these predictions to empirical results generated in simulation. These results indicate that an integrated approach to planning and execution leveraging flexible execution, replanning, and utility maximization shows significant promise for future tightly-constrained space missions that must address significant uncertainty."

At the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN), these standards are distributed through a network of underground fiber cables to support several Goldstone antennas. Independently developed frequency-measuring instruments generate tremendous quantities of data to monitor and validate the antennas’ stringent frequency requirements. In this paper, we propose a lightweight processing tool capable of detecting disturbances on the frequency signal caused by DSN antenna motions. Our training data is sampled from the movement log of the antenna of interest and the generated data from the fiber optic metrology instrument linked to the antenna. We demonstrate that a convolutional neural network (CNN) model can achieve high accuracies on classifying instances of antenna movements and is an effective predictor when used iteratively on longer, variable stretches of metrology data. The simplicity, low training cost, and high accuracies of our model strongly suggest its efficacy in identifying and troubleshooting frequency disturbances caused by the antenna."

The patch antenna gives a wideband impedance and axial ratio bandwidth of 24% over the 0.3-0.38 GHz frequency band with 90% efficiency. The main advantage is the use of a single feed point to generate circular polarization (CP). The antenna can be used to set up a dual-band (0.3-0.32 GHz and 0.36-0.38 GHz) communication link, with an axial ratio better than 3 dB and a realized CP gain better than 8 dBiC and 10 dBiC, respectively. The interaction between the cavity walls and the patch element, results in near-field coupling and improves the impedance bandwidth as well as the axial ratio bandwidth of the antenna. Being a high gain, high aperture efficiency, low profile, light weight, and single feed point radiating element, this single patch antenna is an excellent candidate for future antenna array."

NISAR mission will provide a very high-resolution (200m) soil moisture product globally with a temporal resolution of 6 days, using L-band SAR observations. A data-driven approach is developed for disaggregating the coarse resolution (9 km) soil moisture data to a very high-resolution (200 m) soil moisture product using fine-scale (~ 10 m) NISAR L-band observations. In this study, we used ALOS PALSAR-2 L-band SAR observations in place of expected NISAR L-band observations. The developed disaggregation approach was tested on two different locations of India and USA and showed that the proposed approach has a great potential to estimate soil moisture at a very high resolution of 200m with very low uncertainties (0.02 m3/m3 – 0.04 m3/m3)."

Transmitting at a ~1.9 mm wavelength, VIPR is highly sensitive to scattering from small particles comprising clouds and precipitation. Variation of VIPR’s cloud and precipitation echo power with frequency is often dominated by water vapor absorption, allowing humidity profiles to be retrieved along the radar’s beam path. One confounding effect in practical measurements is phase noise carried by the radar’s transmit signal, which can result in strong range sidelobes extending from bright targets and obscuring the echo signals of more weakly scattering clouds. Here we show that the magnitude and shape of phase-noise induced clutter from extended, bright cloud signals can be accurately modeled using a combination of empirical measurements of surface-echo phase noise and an analytic model based on the phase-noise sidelobe magnitude from a theoretical point target. This improved understanding of a potential clutter source in millimeter-wave imagine radar can lead to better performance modeling, and it provides motivation to improve the phase noise of very high frequency local oscillators."

The mission uses an electric propulsion (EP) system to rendezvous with and orbit the large metal asteroid (16) Psyche. Spacecraft development is a hybrid approach with deep-space avionics provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and a solar electric propulsion chassis based on Maxar’s 1300-series GEO communications satellites. The payload suite is comprised of a magnetometer, multispectral imager, and gamma ray & neutron spectrometer science instruments and the Deep Space Optical Communications advanced technology demonstration.The spacecraft is currently in the final integration and test phase to support a planned launch period open in August 2022.

The Spacecraft Bus is a carrier of the Payload Module, which includes all the science instruments. The Spacecraft Bus components have been environmentally verified by CNES and the Payload Module components verified by JPL. The Payload Module was delivered to CNES in June 2021 for integration with the Spacecraft Bus to form the Observatory, which is in the process of undergoing a full set of environmental tests before launch. This paper focuses on the environmental test and analysis program at the assembly (unit), subsystem, and module level for the Payload Module hardware that JPL is responsible for verifying.

Advantages of using a HSC flexure includes additional thermal stability, lesser part count and passive deployment mechanism using the stored strain energy. The proposed design is to use two flat HSC strips of thickness ℎ, length 2𝐿ℎ, width 𝑊ℎ that attach to the core-reflector panel interface. The flexure satisfies two main requirements: ability to fold to a specific compaction 𝑑 without material failure and sufficient stiffness in the deployed configuration. The elastica analysis was implemented to identify the maximum strains in the flexure when folded and provide relations that combine Δ, ℎ, 𝐿ℎ with the maximum allowable strain. A simplified analysis was performed of the vibration of a panel-flexure combination using a two degree of freedom system. The vibration analysis reveals a dimensionless length parameter 𝛽 = (𝐿ℎ/𝐿𝑃) (Δ/ℎ) that determines the transition between bending and shear modes. A non-dimensional relationship was obtained between the natural frequency and 𝛽 that captures the impact of each parameter on the response of the structure. Our current work involves fabricating and testing of the proposed flexures using High Strain Composite materials, with plans to build a prototype for a deployable reflectarray."

These are environments described by large temperature excur- sions, large pressure excursions, and large radiation excursions from the nominal conditions near sea level which are largely populated by humans. These extreme locales represent such places as the ocean ice, the briny pools of Death Valley and deep mines, the acidic hot springs of the High Sierra or Yellowstone, or even the clouds of our upper atmosphere. The preponderance of bacterial life in these extreme environments here on earth suggests that bacterial life might likely exist in the extreme environments of our own solar system, such as the icy moons of Europa or Enceladus. Thus, architecting instruments for detect- ing life in these extreme environments on earth builds confidence that we can architect such instruments for flight missions. In this paper, we discuss our experience with designing digital holo- graphic microscope instruments to enable detection of bacteria in several extreme environments. In particular we discuss three different instruments. The first is our field instrument which is a small, portable instrument for examination of remote sites. The second is submersible instrument which enables exploration of deep aquatic environments and is deployed on a ocean-going drone. The third is a balloon-borne instrument to examine the bacterial content of the upper atmosphere. We will provide a review of each instrument and discuss aspects of instrument engineering for each particular application."

However, the dynamics of these winds is understood primarily via their illumination from a single central source. The Doppler shift seen in resonance lines is a useful tool for inferring these dynamics, but the mapping from that Doppler shift to the radial distance from the source is ambiguous. Binary systems can reduce this ambiguity by providing a second light source at a known radius in the wind, seen from orbitally modulated directions. From the nature of the collision between the winds, a massive companion also provides unique additional information about wind momentum fluxes. Since massive stars are strong ultraviolet (UV) sources, and UV resonance line opacity in the wind is strong, UV instruments with a high resolution spectroscopic capability are essential for extracting this dynamical information. Polarimetric capability also helps to further resolve ambiguities in aspects of the wind geometry that are not axisymmetric about the line of sight, because of its unique access to scattering direction information. We review how the proposed MIDEX-scale mission Polstar can use UV spectropolarimetric observations to critically constrain the physics of colliding winds, and hence radiatively-driven winds in general. We propose a sample of 20 binary targets, capitalizing on this unique combination of illumination by companion starlight, and collision with a companion wind, to probe wind attributes over a range in wind strengths. Of particular interest is the hypothesis that the radial distribution of the wind acceleration is altered significantly, when the radiative transfer within the winds becomes optically thick to resonance scattering in multiple overlapping UV lines."

Scattering can also be an important source of polarization, especially at short wavelengths. Because of both grain alignment and scattering physics, the wavelength dependence of the polarization, generally, traces the size of the aligned grains. Similarly because of the differing wavelength dependencies of dichroic extinction and scattering polarization, the two can generally be reliably separated. Ultraviolet (UV) polarimetry therefore provides a unique probe of the smallest dust grains (diameter<0.09 μm
), their mineralogy and interaction with the environment. However, the current observational status of interstellar UV polarization is very poor with less than 30 lines of sight probed. With the modern, quantitative and well-tested, theory of interstellar grain alignment now available, we have the opportunity to advance the understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) by executing a systematic study of the UV polarization in the ISM of the Milky Way and near-by galaxies. The Polstar mission will provide the sensitivity and observing time needed to carry out such a program (probing hundreds of stars in the Milky Way and dozens of stars in the LMC/SMC), addressing questions of dust composition as a function of size and location, radiation- and magnetic-field characteristics as well as unveiling the carrier of the 2175 Å extinction feature. In addition, using high-resolution UV line spectroscopy Polstar will search for and probe the alignment of, and polarization from, aligned atoms and ions - so called “Ground State Alignment”, a potentially powerful new probe of magnetic fields in the diffuse ISM."

Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of the nitrogenase complex prepared under enzymatic turnover conditions.

The event generated a broad range of atmospheric waves observed globally by various ground-based and spaceborne instrumentation networks. Most prominent was the surface-guided Lamb wave (≲0.01 hertz), which we observed propagating for four (plus three antipodal) passages around Earth over 6 days. As measured by the Lamb wave amplitudes, the climactic Hunga explosion was comparable in size to that of the 1883 Krakatau eruption. The Hunga eruption produced remarkable globally detected infrasound (0.01 to 20 hertz), long-range (~10,000 kilometers) audible sound, and ionospheric perturbations.

The airship uses both buoyancy and aerodynamic lift to control its altitude. In addition, solar panels distributed over the aircraft provide energy to the propellers and allow for battery recharging. Our approach uses a sampling-based planner that relies on Dubins’ Airplane paths deformed under the influence of the winds to create a tree of kinematically feasible trajectories. We use the battery state to prune energetically unfeasible trajectories and we propose a cost function that accounts for the energy expenditure of the propulsive system and that considers battery charging by using the Economics notion of opportunity cost. The method is illustrated through a series of simulations that show how the vehicle takes longer and high-altitude paths to minimize the use of energy and favor battery recharge. Our results also show that naive trajectories are not feasible in terms of energy, justifying the need for more efficient solutions."

Glenn Research Center (GRC), an effort was undertaken to extend our current computational capabilities of OpenNCC in some important ways with the implementation of a modeling approach to account for the droplet breakup caused by a shock-induced gas motion, & a vaporization model valid over a wide range of pressure conditions encountered in multiphase detonation.

With the modified code, a study was undertaken to investigate the individual droplet behavior
followed by the passage of a shock front. The study is carried out by tracking a sparse group of droplets to gain some understanding of shock induced droplet behavior under various shock strengths & fuel injector conditions. The study also looks into the effect of randomization involved in determining the droplet breakup outcomes. Over a wide range of sub-critical conditions examined, larger droplets are observed to undergo significant changes in droplet behavior following their breakup. However, smaller droplets (10 µm or less ) remain unaffected by any shock induced breakup.

In a follow-on work, we investigated the impact of shock and droplet interaction in a detonation
study involving both gaseous as well as gas/liquid (droplet clouds) fuel/air stoichiometric mixtures in a simple 3D shock-tube configuration. The droplet clouds are made up of different initial droplet sizes of either 6, 10, or 30 µm. We also investigated the individual droplet behavior followed by the passage of a detonation front. The results represent conditions that lead to both overdriven and C-J (ChapmanJouguet) detonations. Under both test conditions, most of the droplet vaporization is completed within a short distance (duration) behind the detonation front & well within the region of complete combustion observed in a corresponding equivalent gas-phase
fuel/air mixture. The impact of the shock-induced droplet breakup is found to be significant in the calculations involving the 30-µm droplets. Subsequent to the breakup, the drop sizes vary from 1 to 10 µm. Another factor that contributed to the observed rapid vaporization is the result of vaporization taking place under supercritical conditions. The overall detonation properties of various droplet clouds (made up of different initial sizes) are similar to those observed in a corresponding gaseous fuel/air mixture. In the calculation involving a gaseous fuel, the calculated C-J detonation velocity is 1822 m/s involving Jet-A/air and φ = 1. In the overdriven detonation, it is 2044 m/s. In the calculations involving droplet clouds, the corresponding detonation velocities are lower. The impact of increased droplet size is primarily seen in a higher reduction in the detonation velocity."

As solar energy is a clean, renewable energy form, its integration into the region’s power grids lowers energy costs and incentivizes sustainable development. We partnered with the Washington D.C. Department of Energy & Environment (DOEE) to determine how urban areas surrounding D.C. can better be incorporated into decisions regarding renewable energy policy. The team used NASA’s Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) solar data and a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived digital surface model, to estimate and visualize rooftop solar potential for Maryland’s Prince George’s and Montgomery counties. POWER provided solar irradiance data adjusted for tilt angle while the digital surface model contributed aspect and slope data. This methodology factored out areas that were unsuitable for solar panel installation while displaying areas that possess a high potential for energy return. The team found the total rooftop solar potential for the study area to be almost 32 million kW, which is equivalent to roughly 660 kW per building. The methodology used to generate the solar potential maps can be applied to other regions of the country seeking to efficiently utilize solar energy. The end users at the DOEE can use our resulting solar potential map and data table to effectively target buildings that have the highest potential to generate solar energy."

The work described in this report demonstrates an application of RTA and examines the implications for design and analysis of aircraft functions and systems; aircraft safety hazards; safety assurance; development assurance; and pilot tasks and performance. This research effort also seeks to assess the efficacy of the combined application of traditional Functional Hazard Analysis (FHA) and the more modern System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) techniques to perform hazard analyses on aircraft with complex automated and autonomous systems and an onboard pilot. During the research effort we developed architectural designs of two alternate eVTOL aircraft, generally following the process characterized in the SAE standards ARP4754 and ARP4761. The design has focused on the control architectures of these aircraft, which are identical except that one incorporates RTA techniques to reduce the criticality of some key software components. Artifacts of this process include a taxonomy of aircraft-level functions, aircraft-level architecture diagrams, aircraft-level functional hazard assessments (AFHA), function allocations onto aircraft systems and subsystems, functional block diagrams for a select set of control-related functions, and system-level functional hazard assessments (SFHA) for those functions. This project has highlighted the notion that DAL D is something of a sweet spot for low-confidence controllers in an RTA-based design. Among the many activities described in DO-178C, the activities related to requirement verifiability, algorithmic accuracy, and test coverage can be the most challenging for the kinds of advanced control techniques that may be desirable in novel UAM designs, such as adaptive control, machine-learning, artificial intelligence, numerical search, and Monte Carlo based algorithms. Moreover, the standard requires that development teams demonstrate that errors leading to unacceptable failure conditions have been removed from the software. The RTA architecture, which cordons off the low-confidence function, makes it much easier to show this for these kinds of algorithms. With regard to the use of STPA and FHA as complementary hazard analysis techniques, our research effort led us to the conclusion that STPA should be used to derive requirements for hardware and software systems and/or components. Also, STPA is a natural complement to other processes in ARP4754A involving design studies and iteration."

In low earth orbit, those impacts could be the result of collisions with pieces of orbital debris or with meteorites. Beyond LEO, and especially beyond GEO, those impacts will likely be caused by meteorites. Such high-speed impacts on spacecraft surfaces create debris clouds that travel towards and eventually impact other downstream spacecraft components. In addition to the impulsive load that such debris clouds would impart to the spacecraft elements with which they subsequently collide, the largest fragment in these debris clouds poses a significant threat on its own to those spacecraft elements. In order to be able to assess the severity of the threat posed by such a fragment, it is important to be able to predict the extent of damage sustained by the impacted spacecraft element. In this paper, we present a new process for determining the penetration depth in a shielded TPS tile system. The requirements for the process were that it be applicable across a full spectrum of impact low velocities (i.e. from ~ 7 km/s to above 50 km/s), that it be applicable over a wide range of projectile materials densities (i.e. ranging from water to steel, for example), and that it be applicable over a wide range of trajectory obliquities (i.e. not just normal impacts). Furthermore, the process developed should be sufficiently flexible so that it can be used for shield design parameter and / or system configuration trade studies (i.e. be written in terms of as many shield and TPS tile system parameters as possible). Following the initial impact of the projectile on the outer wall of the dual-wall shield, a debris cloud (i.e. the primary debris cloud) is created that travels towards and impacts the inner wall of the shield. Within this debris cloud is a combination of solid, liquid, and vaporized material, depending on the impact velocity and the impedance mismatch of the projectile and outer wall materials. The impact of this debris cloud on the inner wall creates another debris cloud (i.e. the secondary debris cloud) that then travels towards and impacts the TPS tile. Within the particulate distribution of the material in each of these debris clouds is a so-called largest fragment. The process used to calculate the penetration depth in a shielded TPS tile system developed herein consists of the following three steps:
1.	Does the initial projectile perforate the outer wall of the shield? If NO, the TPS tile remains undamaged. If YES, calculate the size and speed of the largest fragment exiting the outer wall of the shield and traveling towards the shield’s inner wall.
2.	Does the largest fragment in the debris cloud exiting the outer wall of the shield perforate the inner wall of the shield? If NO, the TPS tile again remains undamaged. If YES, calculate the size and speed of the largest fragment exiting the rear of the shield inner wall.
3.	Calculate the penetration depth of the largest fragment in the debris cloud exiting the inner wall into the TPS.
Perforation of the inner and outer shield walls is predicted using the Cour-Palais penetration depth equation and an associated failure criterion [1]. The largest debris cloud fragment diameters and associated velocities are calculated using regression equations developed from a mix of hydrocode and experimental diameter and velocity information [2]. Finally, TPS penetration depths are calculated using an empirical penetration depth predictor equation based on high-speed impact test data and are calibrated using a limited number of hydrocode penetration depth predictions for water, nylon, aluminum, Dunite, and steel projectiles
The predictions of the penetration depth calculation process are compared against the predictions of more than 60 SPHC hydrocode runs. These comparisons show that the process used to calculate TPS tile penetration depths usually yields values that are within 1 mm of the predictions of hydrocode simulations. If a maximum allowable TPS penetration depth is known, the process developed herein can now be used to develop a failure limit equation that would predict whether or not an impacting particle would penetrate deeply enough into the TPS to result in a “failed” or “not failed” end state.

We leverage NASA’s Formal Requirement Elicitation Tool (FRET), and the RV system Copilot.  We extend FRET with mechanisms to capture additional information needed to generate monitors, and introduce OGMA, a new tool to bridge the gap between FRET and Copilot.

We  use  the  flexible  Bayesian  spectral  energy  distribution  (SED)  fitting  code Prospector with a range of star-formation histories (SFHs), a flexible dust attenuation law and a self-consistent modeling of emission lines.  This approach allows us to assess how different priors affect our results, and how well we can break degeneracies between dust attenuation, stellar ages, metallicity and emission lines  using  data  which  probe  only  the  rest-frame  ultraviolet  to  optical  wavelengths.   We  measure  a median observed ultraviolet spectral slope β= −1.87+0.35−0.43 for relatively massive star-forming galaxies (9<log(M?/M)<10), consistent with no change from z=4 to z=9−10 at these stellar masses, implying rapid enrichment.  Our SED-fitting results are consistent with a star-forming main sequence with  sub-linear  slope  (0.7±0.2)  and  specific  star-formation  rates  of  3−10  Gyr−1.   However,  the stellar  ages  and  SFHs  are  less  well  constrained.   Using  different  SFH  priors,  we  cannot  distinguish between median mass-weighted ages of ∼50−150 Myr, which corresponds to 50% formation redshifts of z50∼10−12 atz∼9 and is of the order of the dynamical timescales of these systems.  Importantly, the models with different SFH priors are able to fit the data equally well.  We conclude that the current observational data cannot tightly constrain the mass-buildup timescales of these z=9−11 galaxies, with our results consistent with SFHs implying both a shallow and steep increase of the cosmic SFR density with time at z >10"

The ultimate goal has been to develop the Flow Boiling and Condensation Experiment (FBCE) for the International Space Station (ISS). Based on the findings from prior flow boiling experiments both at different orientations in Earth gravity and onboard parabolic flights simulating short durations of microgravity, a final refined experiment design, construction, and operating procedure have been arrived at for long-duration microgravity flow boiling experiments onboard the ISS. This study investigates flow boiling of n-Perfluorohexane with subcooled inlet in a rectangular channel of dimensions 114.6 mm heated length, 2.5 mm width, and 5 mm height. These pre-launch experiments (Mission Sequence Testing) were conducted in vertical upflow orientation in Earth gravity using the same experimental rig that was launched to the ISS in August 2021. The various operating parameters varied are heating configuration (single- and double-sided), mass velocity (180 – 3200 kg/m2s), inlet subcooling (+0 – 32°C, encompassing both highly subcooled and near-saturated inlet conditions), and inlet pressure (119 – 191 kPa). High-speed video flow visualization images are presented to explain the two-phase interfacial physics within the channel’s heated section. Heat transfer results in terms of flow boiling curves, streamwise profiles of wall temperature and heat transfer coefficient, and averaged heat transfer coefficients are analyzed and parametric effects elucidated. Severe temporal thermodynamic equilibrium is observed for near-saturated inlet at very low velocities. Nucleate boiling degradation starts at larger heat fluxes for single-sided heating than double sided at low mass velocities with highly subcooled inlet, and conversely at high mass velocities with near-saturated inlet. Nucleate boiling degradation can be delayed to higher heat fluxes by highly subcooling the inlet and increasing mass velocity. The entire local heat transfer coefficient profiles are degraded at higher heat fluxes for near-saturated inlet, but only the downstream part for highly subcooled inlet. This study also confirmed reliability of the upcoming ISS experimental data for subcooled inlet conditions and the collected Earth-gravity data will be used for comparison against the ISS data."

Whether these conditions are sufficiently abundant and collocated to support life remains unknown and cannot be determined from Cassini data. However, thanks to the plume of oceanic material emanating from Enceladus’ south pole, a new mission to Enceladus could search for evidence of life without having to descend through kilometers of ice. In this article, we outline the science motivations for such a successor to Cassini, choosing the primary science goal to be determining whether Enceladus is inhabited and assuming a resource level equivalent to NASA's Flagship-class missions. We selected a set of potential biosignature measurements that are complementary and orthogonal to build a robust case for any life detection result. This result would be further informed by quantifications of the habitability of the environment through geochemical and geophysical investigations into the ocean and ice shell crust. This study demonstrates that Enceladus’ plume offers an unparalleled opportunity for in situ exploration of an Ocean World and that the planetary science and astrobiology community is well equipped to take full advantage of it in the coming decades."

As NASA continues to refine the reference designs to meet the needs of an evolving architecture, it is expected that this information will also be updated as a result. Where appropriate, relevant publicly released documents will be referenced to provide further detail.

NASA’s human lunar exploration plan under the Artemis program calls for achieving the goal of sending the first woman and first person of color to the surface of the Moon in the mid- 2020s and working toward sustainable exploration by the end of the decade. Working with both commercial and international partners, NASA will establish a permanent human presence on the Moon to uncover new scientific discoveries and lay the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy. Longer duration missions on the lunar surface and in lunar orbit will also serve as a test bed for technologies to support future Mars exploration campaigns. The agency will use what we learn on the Moon to prepare for humanity's next giant leap – sending astronauts to Mars.

NASA intends to establish a sustained lunar presence with the development of the Artemis Base Camp to prove technologies and capabilities that will one day enable humans to live and work on Mars, beginning with core elements including the Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV), the Pressurized Rover (PR), the lunar Surface Habitat (SH), power systems, and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems. For in space operations and eventual transport of humans to Mars, NASA will utilize a Mars Transit Habitat (TH). Following deployment, the TH will complete a series of longer duration missions and shakedown testing while docked at Gateway, leveraging Gateway’s habitation redundancy for safety measures. Proposed Gateway-TH missions will far exceed the longest duration cislunar human missions to date. They will be the first operational readiness tests of our long-duration deep space systems, and of the split crew (two crew on the surface, two crew in space) operations that are vital to the approach for the first human Mars mission.
 
Both the SH and TH are major architectural elements of NASA’s Moon to Mars (M2M) approach, each with very different concepts of operation. The SH is intended for use on the lunar surface as a home for astronauts, surface operations base, science facility, hub for communications, extravehicular activity (EVA) equipment repair site, waste processing facility, and supply hub. It serves as an enabler for a sustained surface presence and preparation for partial gravity operations during Mars missions. The SH will be designed to be self-sufficient for operations on the lunar surface. The SH will independently provide several functions, including its own power generation, energy storage capability, sleep quarters, hygiene areas, work areas, and dining areas. It will be capable of communicating with surface assets, orbital assets, and directly with Earth ground stations. It is planned to operate with two crew in the habitat for ~28- day stays with crew swap-outs in which the PR crew of two trades places with the habitat crew. During the swap-out, the habitat will nominally support four crew for a short period of time. For contingency scenarios, the habitat must also be capable of supporting four crew for up to 7 days.

The TH will be designed to be capable of up to ~1,200-day Mars missions with the ability to carry all food and supplies needed to support a crew of four for this duration. An assumed Mars mission profile for the TH is to carry crew and supplies for ~850-day roundtrips between Earth and Mars orbit that allows 30-day stays on the Martian surface. To test the systems for this long journey, the TH will be used to extend the duration of missions at Gateway, enabling the orbiting outpost to be used as a Mars analog. These analog missions will be accomplished by attaching the TH to Gateway and conducting lunar surface operations from the TH. The TH may also need to perform free-flying shakedown missions to test out all systems prior to leaving for Mars. The habitat provides many critical functions including: a contingency airlock, crew quarters, galley, hygiene areas, safe haven capability, and science equipment. It can receive docked items from either axial end or on a radial port."

Observations of boundary layer winds can be  used  for  multiple  applications,  including serving  as  input  to toxic  dispersion  models and characterizing winds for low-level aborts. In fall 2020 the USSF requested NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center  (MSFC) Natural Environments Branch (NE) to evaluate wind output from the False Cape(FC) DRWP system (MSFC NE 2021). In that analysis, it was found that data availability was low in the lowest few hundred meters of a profile, shown in Figure 1. To increase the available data, the USSF modified the quality control (QC)  algorithm for the FCDRWP,  which  collected  data from October 2020 to January 2021.

Furthermore, because cheatgrass readily establishes in disturbed landscapes, it can potentially increase fuel loads and exacerbate wildfire risk. In 2020, the Mullen Fire burned 176,878 acres in Carbon and Albany Counties, Wyoming and Jackson County, Colorado. Large fires such as this one raise concern for partners at the United States Forest Service and the United States Geological Survey Fort Collins Science Center, who are tasked with rapidly detecting and controlling invasive species in the post-fire environment. We developed a Random Forest model trained by in-situ field data and spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, and Enhanced Vegetation Index derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission to detect and map cheatgrass presence during the 2021 growing season. The team successfully created a spectral cheatgrass detection map in the study area (RMSE = 13.71, R2 = 0.34). We also produced a NDVI time-series derived from Sentinel-2 MSI to analyze vegetation recovery patterns."

The existing methods either rely on chemical transport models (CTMs) to forecast spatial distribution of PM2.5 with nontrivial uncertainty or statistical algorithms to forecast PM2.5 concentration time-series at air monitoring locations without continuous spatial coverage. In this study, we developed a PM2.5 forecast framework by combining the robust Random Forest algorithm with a publicly accessible global CTM forecast product – NASA’s Goddard Earth Observing System “Composition Forecasting” (GEOS-CF), providing spatiotemporally continuous PM2.5 concentration forecasts for the next five days at a 1-km spatial resolution. Our forecast experiment was conducted for a region in Central China including the populous and polluted Fenwei Plain. The forecast for the next two days had overall validation R2 of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively; the R2 was around 0.5 for the following three forecast days. Spatial cross-validation showed similar validation metrics. Our forecast model, with validation normalized mean bias close to zero, substantially reduced the large biases in GEOS-CF. The proposed framework requires minimal computational resources compared to running CTMs at urban scales, enabling near-real-time PM2.5 forecast in resource-restricted environments."

Ongoing research proposes a paradigm of airspace communications, such that resources are autonomously and dynamically allocated via intelligent agents; this allocation requires accurate representations of the NAS, including the predicted positions of aircraft. State-of-the-art research emphasizes the importance of a hybrid-recurrent framework for trajectory prediction and compares the impact of commonly considered weather data on prediction accuracy.
However, current research has been limited in its scope of efforts, frequently utilizing a unique flight route, architecture, set of weather data, and date range. This article considers the challenges of generalizing hybrid-recurrent predictive models for flight trajectories. Results illustrate an increase in error variance when identical models are trained over a generalized set of flights; this may be mitigated with careful tuning of hyperparameters, both in the network structure and optimization algorithms. Even so, an irreducible vertical error was identified,
resulting from the complex takeoff and landing procedures which can not be correlated to functions of weather or additional assumptions of aircraft behavior. Finally, the use of a test route indicates that generalized models still do not possess sufficient knowledge for general aircraft predictions, with mean error increases ranging from 70-500%. These results illustrate the need for continued efforts on improving model versatility, as well as potential limitations for spectrum allocation near airports and other centers."

On younger surfaces with thinner regolith, smaller, more frequent impacts are sufficient to excavate rocks. We quantify the correlation between observed rock abundances and age on the lunar surface by comparing Diviner rock abundance data to the surface ages of inter-crater parts on the maria. Our observations show the expected negative correlation between age and rock abundance. The commonality of non-zero rock abundance values on ancient surfaces, combined with a simple Monte Carlo model of the rock excavation process, suggest that rocks re-excavated from the regolith volume contribute to the presently observed rock population on the lunar surface. The half-life of meter-scale surface rocks most consistent with our observations is 80±20 Myr."

Changing energy flows sparked by sea ice decline, spotlight atmosphere-surface coupling processes as central to Arctic system function and its climate change response. Despite this, the representation of surface turbulent flux parameterizations in models has not kept pace with our understanding. The large uncertainty in Arctic climate change projections, the central role of atmosphere-surface coupling, and the large discrepancy in model representation of surface turbulent fluxes indicates that these processes may serve as useful observational constraints on projected Arctic climate change. This possibility requires an evaluation of surface turbulent fluxes and their sensitivity to controlling factors (surface-air temperature and moisture differences, sea ice, and winds) within contemporary climate models (here Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6). The influence of individual controlling factors and their interactions is diagnosed using a multi-linear regression approach. This evaluation is done for four sea ice loss regimes, determined from observational sea ice loss trends, to control for the confounding effects of natural variability between models and observations. The comparisons between satellite- and model-derived surface turbulent fluxes illustrate that while models capture the general sensitivity of surface turbulent fluxes to declining sea ice and to surface-air gradients of temperature and moisture, substantial mean state biases exist. Specifically, the central Arctic is too weak of a heat sink to the winter atmosphere compared to observations, with implications to the simulated atmospheric circulation variability and thermodynamic profiles. Models were found to be about 50% more efficient at turning an air-sea temperature gradient anomaly into a sensible heat flux anomaly relative to observations. Further, the influence of sea ice concentration on the sensible heat flux is underestimated in models compared to observations. The opposite is found for the latent heat flux variability in models; where the latent heat flux is too sensitive to a sea ice concentration anomaly. Lastly, the results suggest that present-day trends in sea ice retreat regions may serve as suitable observational constraints of projected Arctic warming."

COSI’s energy resolution of ∼0.2% at 1.8 MeV, single-photon reconstruction, and wide field of view make it capable of studying astrophysical nuclear lines, particularly the 1809 keVγ-ray line from decaying Galactic 26Al. Most 26Al originates in massive stars and core-collapse supernova nucleosynthesis, but the  path from stellar evolution models to Galaxy-wide emission remains unconstrained. In 2016, COSI had a successful 46-day flight on a NASA super pressure balloon. Here, we detail the first search for the 1809 keV26Al line in the COSI 2016 balloon flight using a maximum likelihood analysis. We find a Galactic 26Al flux of (8.6±2.5) ×10−4ph cm−2s−124 within the Inner Galaxy (|ℓ|≤30◦,|b|≤10◦) with 3.7σ significance above background. Within uncertainties, this flux is consistent with expectations from previous measurements by SPI and COMPTEL. This analysis demonstrates COSI’s powerful capabilities for studies of γ-ray lines and underscores the scientific potential of future compact Compton telescopes.

of the spacecraft so as to view the entire sky that is not occulted by the Earth. The LAT is a pair production telescope based on silicon strip trackers, a Cesium Iodide calorimeter, and a plastic scintillator anticoincidence system. It covers the energy range from about 20 MeV to more than 500 GeV, with a field of view of about 2.4 steradians. Thanks to their huge fields of view, the instruments can observe the entire sky with a cadence of about an hour for GBM and about three hours for LAT. All γ-ray data from Fermi become public immediately, enabling a broad range of multiwavelength and multimessenger research. Over 3000 γ-ray bursts (GRBs), including GRB 170817A associated with a neutron star merger detected in gravitational waves, and 5000 high-energy sources, including the blazar TXS 0506+056 associated with high-energy neutrinos, have been detected by the Fermi instruments. The Fermi Science Support Center provides a wide array of resources to enable scientific use of the data, including background models, source catalogs, analysis software, documentation, and a Help Desk."

This is a highly scalable parallel FORTRAN 2003 code for simulating the thermodynamic evolution of materials at the atomic level,  and  predicting  their  thermodynamic  state,  phase  diagram,  chemical  composition  and mechanical  properties.  The  code  is  specifically  designed  to  simulate  multi-component  alloy systems, predict solid-state phase transformations such as austenite-martensite transformations, precipitate formation, recrystallization, capillary effects at interfaces, surface absorption, etc., which can aid the design of novel metallic alloys. While the software is mainly tailored for modeling metal alloys, it can also be used for other types of solid-state systems, and to some degree for liquid or gaseous systems, including multiphase systems forming solid-liquid-gas interfaces. In addition to performing Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the code can also perform Molecular Dynamics  (MD)  and  Langevin  Dynamics  (LD)  simulations,  which  can  be  combined  and interchanged with MC for faster and more efficient system evolution.

members have reported increased or even new allergic reactions to environmental allergens after their return. (2) Methods: Blood samples from five overwintering crews were analyzed using the chip based multiplex ALEX Allergy Explorer (MacroArray Diagnostics GmbH, Austria). (3) Results: About one third of the 39 participants displayed specific IgEs against pollen. In most individuals, kinetics showed a reduction in the specific IgE at the time about nine months after deployment to Antarctica. Five participants had the highest specific IgE levels after returning to the “normal” world. The examination of the specific IgE relative to house dust mites and storage mites showed different kinetics. Six out of 10 had the highest specific IgE concentrations at the inner Antarctic measurement time point. These data corresponded well to the general situation in the stations. At the stations themselves, there were almost no pollen particle load, especially at Concordia. (4) Conclusions: Antarctic long-term confinement can induce an altered immune function, which is in some individuals pronounced after return to the familiar allergen environment. Future prospective studies in larger cohorts are needed to further specify these first results."

Previous studies and recent history have shown that volcanically-driven climate cooling can occur through reflection of sunlight by H2SO4 aerosols, while longer-term climate warming can occur via CO2 emissions.  We use the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model to simulate a four-year duration volcanic SO2  emission of the scale of the Wapshilla Ridge member of the Columbia River Basalt eruption.  Brief cooling from H2SO4 aerosols is outweighed by dynamically and radiatively driven warming of the climate through a three orders of magnitude increase in stratospheric H2O vapor."

As a result, the ubiquitous triboelectric charging mechanism can lead to high levels of charge on surfaces. This static charge can result in damage to sensitive devices, interfere with communications, and electrostatic levitation of lunar dust. At the NASA Electrostatics and Surface Physics Laboratory (ESPL), we use different apparatuses and techniques to tribo-charge materials in high-vacuum (10-5 torr), including a tribo-robot and a triboelectric regolith-material stage (TRMS). The tribo-robot is used to rub two materials together, and fieldmeters and electrometers can be used to determine how much charge is on the materials. The TRMS is used to drag different materials onto a bed of lunar simulant. This system is used to characterize how materials may interact with lunar dust using fieldmeters, electrometers, and laser scattering. Using these methods, we are building a database of how different space materials charge when contacting each other at high-vacuum, and how materials triboelectrically interact with the lunar surface."

In this talk, we present a novel quantum algorithm based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) to apply an arbitrary operator K to some input state and subsequently estimate the expectation value of some observable. Our construction then immediately yields a route to estimating observables of states undergoing open quantum dynamics, whose effect is captured by a set of non-unitary Kraus operators. Our algorithm succeeds deterministically given the Sz-Nagy dilation, and we provide details on the algorithm's query and gate complexity, numerical verification, and comparisons with prior methods."

This paper covers NASA’s understanding of the current state-of-the-art for electric motor winding insulation reliability, life modeling and qualification testing in the context of UAM. The needed improvements to the accepted practice for qualification of high reliability UAM motors are highlighted.

Researchers have typically applied these experimental results by assuming that high laboratory fluxes cause the same effects as do the significantly lower fluxes found in nature. New work, however, shows that this assumption may often be invalid. In particular, experiments using charged particle fluences  cm−2 without adequate steps to neutralize the targets risk causing dielectric breakdown, or “sparking”—a process that may affect some airless bodies. Consequently, it is critical to understand the laboratory conditions under which breakdown occurs, both to ensure that experiments properly simulate the effects of charged particles and to study the possibility that dielectric breakdown can, in some locations, contribute to space weathering."

The 730,000 gallons of propellants that will be loaded into the rocket are liquid oxygen (LO2) and liquid hydrogen (LH2). 

Pauses in the countdown, or ""holds,"" are built into the countdown to allow the launch team to target a precise launch window, and to provide a cushion of time for certain tasks and procedures without impacting the overall schedule.

Thus Variable Hard/Soft Sphere (VHS/VSS)collision parameters are not available for most molecules of interest in the decomposition of methane, a significant pyrolysis gas product and potential atmospheric species for Titan re-entries. As these properties are essential for accurate modeling of gas transport and thermochemical effects, a method must be devised to compute them for use in DSMC. In this study, the methodology outlined in Stephani et al is utilized to compute the VHS/VSS parameters by fitting the Ω(1,1)and Ω(2,2) collision integrals [1]. 

These  collision  integrals  are  typically  computed  from  intermolecular  potentials  and  are  used  in  CFD  simulations  to calculate  transport  properties  such  as  viscosity,  thermal  conductivity, and  diffusion.  This  approach  ensures  consistency between micro-scale collisions and macro-scale transport properties. To produce the necessary collision integrals needed for the fitting routine, we utilize the method described by Laricchiuta et al, where collision integrals are computed based on the constituent particles’ polarizability and effective electron number [2].Preliminary  computations  of  pure-species Ω(1,1)and Ω(2,2)collision integrals produced from the coupled approach of Stephani et al and Laricchiuta et al for methane show good agreement with those computed via available ab-initio Potential Energy Surface Computations, as seen in Figure 1. Above 300K, no more than 12% deviation is observed between the two results over the temperature range of the fitted PES data [3].Current results of this study include full collision-specificVSS transport properties for a complex-species mixture involving major byproducts of pure methane decomposition. Targeted final results will include a comprehensive list of VSS parameters relevant toDSMC simulations of Titan atmospheric entry, based on the reduced kinetic model of Savajano et al [4]."

This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI’s footprint-level (~25 m) AGBD (GEDI04_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI’s waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of AGBD, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available."

The ice resulting from these plumes forms the E Ring of Saturn. Missions are under study to fly through these plumes and collect and analyze samples to look for evidence of life. To support design and instrument selection for these missions, there is a critical need to understand what happens to microbial life adapted to a liquid environment when suddenly ejected into the vacuum of space. We experimentally determined the structural changes in microbial cells in liquid medium when ejected into vacuum. We first developed a vacuum chamber fitted with a feedthrough and nozzle allowing fluid to be injected into vacuum. The nozzle dispersed the fluid into micron-sized droplets. Fluid containing a population of E. Coli microbes was injected into the chamber and droplets were collected on microscope slides and small cups for imaging with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Epifluorescence microscopy, using a lipid stain, and SEM imaging were used to evaluate the cellular integrity of E. coli after injection through the pressurized nozzle into vacuum. The experimental samples showed a 94% decrease in visible intact E. coli cells as compared with control samples but showed a fluorescent residue in the shape of the sublimated droplets that indicated the presence of lipids. E. coli was selected for testing although other cell types could vary physiologically which could affect their response to a vacuum environment. More testing is needed to determine whether other types of microbial cells can survive the plume environment. However, these results suggest that lipids may be directly detectable evidence of life in icy world plumes, but organisms are unlikely to survive due to disruption of their cell walls."

CALET observations were compared with the measurements of the Van Allen Probes in the near-equatorial plane to investigate the global radiation belt dynamics and the REP drivers. The magnetically conjugate observations from these two missions demonstrate that the significant MeV precipitation directly detected by CALET in low-Earth orbit during a period of radiation belt depletion following the passage of a high-speed stream, was associated with dusk-side electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves. In addition, the combined wave, REP and trapped electron data suggest that the reported radiation belt depletion can be likely ascribed to the concomitant loss effects of EMIC wave scattering driving the atmospheric precipitation, as well as outward radial diffusion associated with magnetopause shadowing."

In this paper, a geometrical comparative analysis is performed between different approaches making use of the Floquet modes reference frame. Two particular station-keeping procedures are considered: the commonly used velocity constraint at the plane crossing, and the Floquet mode approach. The first method finds the Δv that ensures that the x component of the velocity vector is zero at a plane crossing, whereas the Floquet mode approach finds the Δv that cancels the unstable mode in the Floquet reference frame. It will be seen that both approaches have some basic common geometrical features, even when they are compared using high-order techniques."

Mill.; BF). We used Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms for LAI and BAPH modeling. The results showed that RF outperformed MLP by reducing the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) by 0.01 and 0.06 for LAI and BAPH, respectively. The final variables selected for modeling of both LAI and BAPH indicated the superiority of Sentinel-2 variables over the Sentinel-1 SAR with minor contributions of site variables (mainly elevation). The red-edge spectral vegetation indices played a significant role in both LAI and BAPH estimation. We attained the lowest nRMSEs of 0.12, and 0.16 for the final LAI model of RS, and BF, respectively using Sentinel-2 and site variables. The lowest nRMSE for both RS and BF BAPH models was 0.12. As RS and BF are the primary host species for a cyclically occurring and most destructive pest of the region, eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; SBW), these estimations will be useful to evaluate SBW dynamics in the region."

The position of a rigid body mounted on a motorized linear stage is compared to its position reported by the motion tracking system as it travels through the facility's 777m$^3$ capture volume of interest.  Experiments show that the mean error reported by the motion tracking system for the aggregate capture volume is in-line with independent measurements collected using the motion stage.  Error within regions of the capture volume exceed the mean error reported by the motion tracking system, likely due to occlusion, and suggests that additional cameras should be used to increase measurement accuracy in these regions.  Overall, results show that error values reported by the motion tracking system are representative of the measurement error in a collected data set and validates the system's use for characterizing the mobility and tractive performance of robots, rovers, and other vehicles for planetary exploration."

The test fixture was used to impose displacement conditions consistent with those in an analytical tool being developed to predict panel behavior in the vicinity of a central notch, which included the assumption that there would be no out-of-plane displacement and no buckling. However, pretest analysis using finite element models for a panel loaded without any out-of-plane restraint in the region of the notch indicated that with an imperfection magnitude equal to 20 percent of the thickness of the thin-skin panel, an unacceptable amount of out-of-plane deformation would occur as Poisson effects induced compression loads in the region of the notch. Therefore, to validate this tool in a test program, a restraint fixture which would suppress out-of-plane motion was required. The panel could not be encased in restraining plates because instrumentation and visibility were required in the vicinity of the notch. Therefore, a fixture that would restrict out-of-plane motion while still allowing access to the surface of the panel at the notch edges for instrumentation and line-of-sight access for cameras was required. To satisfy these requirements, a fixture was designed to restrict only out-of-plane motion near the center of the notch. Two 1.78-m-long test panels were loaded in tension to failure using this fixture. Out-of-plane deformations were not directly measured during testing, so back-to-back strain gages were used to obtain an indication of buckling. Strain results indicated that the restraint fixture performed as designed and buckling did not occur."

Recent advancements in computational capabilities and access to computing tools has outpaced the functionality and extensibility of previously available modeling platforms. Here we present VESIcal (Volatile Equilibria and Saturation Index calculator), the first comprehensive modeling tool for H2O, CO2, and mixed (H2O-CO2) solubility in silicate melts that: a) allows users access to seven popular models, with easy inter-comparison between models; b) provides universal functionality for all models (e.g., functions for calculating saturation pressures, degassing paths, etc.); c) can process large datasets (1,000’s of samples) automatically; d) can output computed data into an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file for post-modeling analysis; e) integrates plotting capabilities directly within the tool; and f) provides all of this within the framework of a python library, making the tool extensible by the user and allowing any of the model functions to be incorporated into any other code capable of calling python.Here we will provide a demonstration of VESIcal and its capabilities with applications to various volcanic processes affected by volatiles. VESIcal represents the first tool capable of directly comparing multiple solubility models and equations of state. We find that commonly used models predict surprisingly different volatile solubilities, particularly for pure CO2 or mixed CO2-H2O fluids. Even for melt compositions that are well represented in the calibration datasets of multiple models (e.g., MORBs), calculated solubilities for pure CO2 and pure H2O can deviate from one another by factors of >2 leading to 2x deviations in calculated saturation pressures (e.g., 5 to 10 kbar). The solubility of CO2 predicted by different rhyolitic models also differs substantially, overwhelming other sources of uncertainty such as analytical errors on measurements of volatile contents or uncertainties in crustal density profiles. This highlights the importance of model choice when drawing geological conclusions based on volatiles in magmas."

problem as well as the study of classical simulability. In particular, stoquastic Hamiltonians can
be straightforwardly simulated using Monte Carlo techniques. We address the question of whether two or more Hamiltonians may be made simultaneously stoquastic via a unitary transformation. This question has important implications for the complexity of simulating quantum annealing where quantum advantage is related to the stoquasticity of the Hamiltonians involved in the anneal. We find that for almost all problems no such unitary exists and show that the problem of determining the existence of such a unitary is equivalent to identifying if there is a solution to a system of polynomial (in)equalities in the matrix elements of the initial and transformed Hamiltonians. Solving such a system of equations is NP-hard. We highlight a geometric understanding of this problem in terms of a collection of generalized Bloch vectors."

To predict locations where wildfires were likely to start, the Corporación Nacional Forestal (CONAF) created a wildfire risk model within ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine (GEE) that utilized the NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS) and the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (STRM) 90-meter datasets. The previous CONAF model was very resource-heavy and time-intensive to run. NASA DEVELOP, in partnership with CONAF, automated the previous model and transferred it fully into GEE where all Earth observation datasets could be used without downloading.

Over the range of flow rates tested, the capillary force is the dominant contributor to the pressure gradient, which is found to be linear with the superficial liquid velocity but is a much weaker function of the superficial gas velocity, and varying inversely with the particle diameter."

Particles were collected in sediment traps deployed at locations in the North Pacific subtropical gyre and the California Current. DNA was isolated from individual
particles, bulk-collected trap particles, and the surface seawater. The relative sequence abundance of exported phytoplankton taxa in the surface water varied across functional groups and ecosystems. Of the sequences detected in sinking particles, about half were present in large (>300 μm), individually isolated particles and primarily belonged to taxa with small cell sizes (<50 μm). Exported phytoplankton taxa detected only in bulk trap samples, and thus presumably packaged in the smaller sinking size fraction, contained taxa that typically have large cell sizes (>500 m). The effect of particle degradation on the detectable 18 S rRNA gene community differed across taxa, and differences in community composition among individual particles from the same location largely reflected differences in relative degradation state. Using these data and particle imaging, we present an approach that incorporates genetic diversity into mechanistic models of the ocean's biological carbon pump, which will lead to better quantification of the ocean’s carbon cycle."

With this emerging transportation industry, there is motivation to characterize the noise of vehicles to determine their potential impacts on the community. An experimental testing campaign was conducted on a representative model of a small unmanned aircraft system in the NASA Langley Low Speed Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel as a continuation of a previous testing campaign. The goals of the current test are to identify sources of interactional noise as well as to test custom-designed rotors and noise reduction devices. The tested noise reduction methods involve increasing the vertical distances between the rotors and the vehicle airframe as well as between the forward and aft rotor disk planes. These methods are intended to reduce rotor-airframe interaction noise in hover and fore-aft rotor wake ingestion noise in forward flight. A phased microphone array is also utilized to identify the locations of prominent noise generation for the different vehicle configurations in forward flight. Elevation of the rotors from the vehicle airframe yielded nearly 8 dBA overall noise reduction in forward flight, while yielding up to 4 dB reduction in overall tonal levels for one of the rotors in hover."

The presented simulator platform is envisioned to serve as a toolkit to visualize, evaluate, and configure future advanced air mobility (AAM) operations. Highlighting features of this toolkit include a modular architecture that allows multiple smart unmanned aerial systems (UASs) to remotely connect to the simulation server and participate in decentralized decision-making scenario simulations. As an example of the decentralized decision-making scenario, an inter-agent negotiation-based conflict resolution use case is considered in this paper, where the UASs leverage the on-board/on-the-edge artificial intelligence (AI) capability to continually build situational awareness, and use this information to predict future conflicts and resolve them through machine-to-machine negotiation. As such operations are non-existent at scale currently, the presented simulation platform offers a viable and cost-effective alternative for assessing the efficacy of AAM research outcomes and challenges in future shared airspace usage. The simulation platform allows plug-n-play connectivity with AI and non-AI compute modules representing individual UAS’s flight control. Each module can interact with the simulation platform independently to communicate current and desired future states, situational awareness, and conflict resolution utilization costs for inter-agent negotiation. The simulation environment orchestrates realistic operational scenarios with spatiotemporal details, dynamic events, tactical conflict-resolution methods, interfaces for customizing air traffic control parameters, and information exchange uncertainties. In the future, this can serve as a community focused cloud simulation platform, incorporating multi-stakeholder airspace constraints from regulatory, government, city, and local agencies."

These variations reflect the combined effect of sea-level rise and changes in storm surge activity. Understanding the relative importance of these two factors in altering the likelihood of extreme events is crucial to the success of coastal adaptation measures. Existing analyses of tide gauge records agree that sea-level rise has been a considerable driver of trends in sea-level extremes since at least 1960. However, the contribution from changes in storminess remains unclear, owing to the difficulty of inferring this contribution from sparse data and the consequent inconclusive results that have accumulated in the literature. Here we analyse tide gauge observations using spatial Bayesian methods to show that, contrary to current thought, trends in surge extremes and sea-level rise both made comparable contributions to the overall change in extreme sea levels in Europe since 1960 . We determine that the trend pattern of surge extremes reflects the contributions from a dominant north–south dipole associated with internal climate variability and a single-sign positive pattern related to anthropogenic forcing. Our results demonstrate that both external and internal influences can considerably affect the likelihood of surge extremes over periods as long as 60 years, suggesting that the current coastal planning practice of assuming stationary surge extremes might be inadequate."

Previous work has shown that suitable streaks of this type can significantly reduce the growth of Mack’s second mode instabilities, but large streak amplitudes can make the flow susceptible to previously absent streak instabilities that can become the leading cause of transition. Here, we use the adjoint capabilities of the SU2 flow solver to optimize the VG shape to maximize the reduction in the growth of second-mode disturbances while also preventing the streak amplitudes from reaching large enough values to precipitate an earlier onset of transition via streak instabilities. The geometry and the freestream flow conditions are selected to match a relevant trajectory lo-cation from the HIFiRE-1 flight experiment. Results show that the optimized VGs can increase the mean streak amplitude by 117% with respect to a manually developed baseline design. The stability of this optimized basic state is analyzed via the plane-marching parabolized stability equations, predicting a fully laminar flow over the entire cone, or equivalently, yielding transition delay of 130% versus the 17% for the baseline VGs."

The scientific community has been demanding ever-increasing capabilities and accuracy from the data provided by these satellites. One key instrument on board a series of satellite platforms is the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which provides high-quality data of the Earth from low Earth orbit covering the visible to long-wave infrared parts of the spectrum. The fourth build in the series, set to be launched on the Joint Polar-orbiting Satellite System 3 (JPSS-3) platform, has recently completed its main ground calibration program and is set to be integrated into the satellite bus in the near future. This calibration program covered a comprehensive series of performance metrics designed to demonstrate the quality of the science data and ensure the instrument can maintain its calibration successfully once on-orbit. The subject of this work covers the radiometric calibration metrics including dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio/noise equivalent differential temperature (SNR/NEdT), polarization sensitivity, scattered light response, relative spectral response, response versus scan angle, and uniformity, as well as uncertainties; all key metrics met or exceeded their design requirements with some minor exceptions.

The flow configuration of primary interest corresponds to the cone-cylinder-flare model used in experimental measurements in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach-6 Quiet Tunnel at Purdue University.  For a flare angle of 10 degrees and a unit Reynolds number of 11.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>-1</sup>, their surface flow visualizations identified the presence of streamwise elongated thermal streaks near the reattachment position and the dominant azimuthal spacing between the streaks was determined to be approximately 10 degrees (i.e., an azimuthal mode number of 36). Previous linear stability analyses predicted that the amplification characteristics of small amplitude, unsteady, convective instabilities within this flow were consistent with the surface pressure fluctuations measured in the experiment. However, their accompanying analysis of global instabilities had found the separation bubble to be weakly unstable at the 10 degrees flare angle, with the most unstable global mode corresponding to a stationary disturbance with an azimuthal wavenumber of <i>m</i> ≈ 5, which was well below the measured wavenumber of <i>m</i> = 36. Besides confirming the presence of the global instability at these flow conditions, the present numerical simulations quantify the details of the stationary equilibrium state associated with the supercritical bifurcation resulting from the nonlinear saturation of the unstable global mode. Although velocity perturbations associated with the saturated global mode are dominated by the fundamental spanwise wavelength associated with the linear global instability, the surface heat flux downstream of reattachment is dominated by <i>m</i> = 36 in agreement with experimental measurements. However, the shorter wavelength peak (<i>m</i> = 36) in the azimuthal spectrum is not manifested as streaks with an azimuthal spacing of 10 degrees. An additional simulation of the combined evolution of both unsteady convective and global instabilities indicates that the nonlinear interactions between a broadband spectrum of oblique Mack’s first mode instabilities generate stationary vortex modes with a higher dominant wavenumber (<i>m</i> = 60) as that observed in the experiments.  Additional analyses are performed to predict the global mode behavior at other flare angles and how it differs from the convective centrifugal instability due to concave streamline curvature over the compression corner."

The selection of leading edge radii and freestream parameters is informed by experimental conditions. The investigation of this 2D problem provides a slow entropy layer swallowing which allows for an isolated development of perturbations seeded upstream within different wall-normal regions of the flow. At both Mach numbers, a decrease in modal instability amplification was seen as the leading edge radius was increased. Nonmodal analysis reveals amplifying perturbations in the boundary layer as well as in the entropy layer. The medium bluntness regime exhibits the strongest amplification of nonmodal disturbances that is nonmonotonic in character. Small amplitude boundary forcing at the plate surface or volumetric forcing at various wall-normal heights was used to account for receptivity effects. While wall forcing effectively induced modal instabilities, only an actuation above the boundary layer captured disturbances that amplify within the entropy layer. The optimal nonmodal theory’s entropy-layer disturbance evolution exhibited outstanding agreement with controlled forcing, including receptivity effects. The evolution of entropy-layer disturbances from the optimal nonmodal theory showed excellent agreement with the results of receptivity to controlled forcing. Therefore, the nonmodal optimal growth analysis may provide a useful as well as efficient technique to identify the complete disturbance spectrum in blunt hypersonic configurations, where both modal and nonmodal disturbances can amplify in the boundary-layer and entropy-layer regions."

In collaboration with the Maine Department of Marine Resources and the Downeast Salmon Federation, the NASA DEVELOP team utilized Earth observations to assess changes within critical salmon habitat. The team used the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 8 Operation Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to refine historical LULC maps from 1985 to 2021. The team also used elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and IDRISI TerrSet Land Change Modeler to forecast LULC change to 2040. From Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data, the team derived a time series, summer averages, and anomaly maps between 2000 and 2021. The team analyzed LST in relation to LULC classes, specifically forest cover type, and in-situ stream temperature from the Spatial Hydro-Ecological Decision System (EcoSHEDS). LULC trends from 1985 to 2021 revealed a net transition of coniferous forest to other classes, such as deciduous forest and developed land.  The team found an association between warmer temperatures and a greater presence of developed and mixed forest classes per 10,000 acres across Maine. These visualizations and analyses will aid partners in identifying riparian locations with ideal or unfavorable habitat conditions to inform Atlantic salmon population recovery efforts."

The nonlinear character of times series can change with time, so it is important to quantify time series nonlinearity without assuming stationarity. A common way of quantifying the time evolution of time series nonlinearity is to compute sliding skewness time series, but it is shown here that such an approach can be misleading when time series contain periodicities. To remedy this deficiency of skewness, a new waveform skewness index is proposed for quantifying local nonlinearities embedded in time series. A waveform skewness spectrum is proposed for determining the frequency components that are contributing to time series waveform skewness. The new methods are applied to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian monsoon to test a recently proposed hypothesis that states that changes in the ENSO–Indian monsoon relationship are related to ENSO nonlinearity. We show that the ENSO–Indian rainfall relationship weakens during time periods of high ENSO waveform skewness. The results from two different analyses suggest that the breakdown of the ENSO–Indian monsoon relationship during time periods of high ENSO waveform skewness is related to the more frequent occurrence of strong central Pacific El Niño events, supporting arguments that changes in the ENSO–Indian rainfall relationship are not solely related to noise."

VX Sgr is a cool, evolved, and luminous red star whose stellar parameters are difficult to determine, which affects its classification.

Aims. We aim to spatially resolve the photospheric extent as well as the circumstellar environment.

Methods. We used interferometric observations obtained with the MATISSE instrument in the L (3–4 μm), M (4.5–5 μm), and N (8–13 μm) bands. We reconstructed monochromatic images using the MIRA software. We used 3D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations carried out with CO5BOLD and a uniform disc model to estimate the apparent diameter and interpret the stellar surface structures. Moreover, we employed the radiative transfer codes OPTIM3D and RADMC3D to compute the spectral energy distribution for the L, M, and N bands, respectively.

Results. MATISSE observations unveil, for the first time, the morphology of VX Sgr across the L, M, and N bands. The reconstructed images show a complex morphology with brighter areas whose characteristics depend on the wavelength probed. We measured the angular diameter as a function of the wavelength and showed that the photospheric extent in the L and M bands depends on the opacity through the atmosphere. In addition to this, we also concluded that the observed photospheric inhomogeneities can be interpreted as convection-related surface structures. The comparison in the N band yielded a qualitative agreement between the N-band spectrum and simple dust radiative transfer simulations. However, it is not possible to firmly conclude on the interpretation of the current data because of the difficulty in constraing the model parameters using the limited accuracy of our absolute flux calibration.

Conclusions. MATISSE observations and the derived reconstructed images unveil the appearance of VX Sgr’s stellar surface and circumstellar environment across a very large spectral domain for the first time."

In ‘type-1’ systems, the bright nucleus is visible at the centre of a face-on torus. In ‘type-2’ systems the thick, nearly edge-on torus hides the central engine. Later studies suggested evolutionary effects2 and added dusty clumps and polar winds3 but left the basic picture intact. However, recent high-resolution images4 of the archetypal type-2 galaxy NGC 10685,6, suggested a more radical revision. The images displayed a ring-like emission feature that was proposed to be hot dust surrounding the black hole at the radius where the radiation from the central engine evaporates the dust. That ring is too thin and too far tilted from edge-on to hide the central engine, and ad hoc foreground extinction is needed to explain the type-2 classification. These images quickly generated reinterpretations of the dichotomy between types 1 and 27,8. Here we present new multi-band mid-infrared images of NGC 1068 that detail the dust temperature distribution and reaffirm the original model. Combined with radio data ( J.F.G. and C.M.V.I., manuscript in preparation), our maps locate the central engine that is below the previously reported ring and obscured by a thick, nearly edge-on disk, as predicted by the unified model. We also identify emission from polar flows and absorbing dust that is mineralogically distinct from that towards the Milky Way centre."

Building on previous positive results obtained with respect to the representation of tropical cyclones (TCs) in a global model, a set of observing system experiments (OSEs) performed using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS, version 5) are investigated, focusing on three case studies—a polar low in the Sea of Okhotsk, a polar low in the Southern Ocean, and a Mediterranean Sea tropical-like cyclone that occurred during the boreal fall season of 2014. Experiments assimilating adaptively thinned cloud-cleared hyperspectral infrared radiances from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on board the NASA Aqua satellite, with higher density in the vicinity of each storm and its pre-cyclogenesis environment, and lower density elsewhere, demonstrate a positive impact on the analyzed representation of each storm. The adaptive thinning experiments improve the storm intensity and structure, including vertical alignment, depth, symmetry, strength, and compactness of warm core compared to the reference experiments. The results suggest that jet-level processes associated with extremely strong horizontal velocity gradients as represented in the model analysis can be useful to locate dynamically active regions of the extratropical atmosphere where denser data coverage is likely to improve the analyzed representation of polar lows and other similar marine mesoscale convective cyclones."

A framework is introduced to predict the performance in the special case of a modification to an existing, previously certified aircraft. This framework uses a combination of existing flight test or high fidelity data of the original aircraft as well as lower fidelity data of the original and modified configurations. Two methods are presented which estimate the model form uncertainty of the modified configuration, which is then used to conduct non-deterministic simulations. The framework is applied to an example aircraft system with simulated flight test data to demonstrate the ability to predict the performance and associated uncertainty of modified aircraft configurations. However, it is important that the models and methods used are applicable and accurate throughout the intended use domain. The factors and limitations of the framework are explored to determine the range of applicability of the framework. The effects of these factors on the performance and uncertainty results are demonstrated using the example aircraft system. The framework is then applied to NASA’s X-57 Maxwell and each of its modifications. The estimated performance and associated uncertainties are then compared to the airworthiness criteria to evaluate the potential of the framework as a component to the certification by analysis process."

NASA DEVELOP partnered with the North Carolina Botanical Garden (NCBG), the University of North Carolina Herbarium (NCU), and the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program (NCNHP) to support Venus flytrap conservation. The team developed models based on species presence data and environmental variables using the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) to create a 2021 habitat suitability map for Venus flytrap. These models incorporated Earth observations collected by Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI). To predict areas at high risk of development, the team produced a 2050 land-use change map using TerrSet Land Change Modeler. The team found potential areas of conflict between predicted habitat and forecasted future development. Many areas of suitable habitat were concentrated along the coast where development was likely to occur, placing populations there at risk of extirpation. Overlaying suitable habitat with forecasted land change also identified suitable habitats with minimal risk of development, which may serve as lasting Venus flytrap habitat. These results can inform the NCBG and NCNHP’s conservation decision-making, including targeted seed banking, reintroduction, and prioritization of enduring habitats for protection and management."

While satellite imagery can be used to study overall patterns and trends, only field observations can provide insights in the dynamics of woody plant populations. Here we used field data from 29 sites in the Dantiandou district in Niger to study woody species composition, plant density, crown cover, basal area, foliage and wood mass from 1996 to 2017. All sites show a decrease in woody plant parameters with a faster decrease in rangeland than in agricultural land. Most of the decrease is due to the loss of shrubs, while trees do not change significantly. When field observations were scaled up to the district level using land use maps, shrub density decreased from 342 to 155 ha-1in agricultural land, and from 1567 to 250 ha-1in rangeland. Trends in annual rainfall and soil moisture during the study period were not significant and cannot explain the decrease of woody vegetation. Instead, the expansion of cropped areas, shortened crop-fallow cycles and the increasing pressure on wood resources to satisfy demand for fuel and construction materials may have contributed to the decline."

To do this, we calculated evapotranspiration as the residual of the water balance, using an ensemble of datasets for precipitation, discharge and total water storage change. We made an error in calculating the global mean precipitation: we used arithmetic averaging to calculate the mean, instead of calculating a spatially weighted mean to account for the changing grid box size with latitude. As a result, the magnitudes of the global mean precipitation time series were underestimated. This impacted the subsequent calculation of global mean evapotranspiration, resulting in the mean evapotranspiration values being underestimated and altering some results. We are therefore retracting this article. We thank Ning Ma and others for bringing this error to our attention."

If the RV slope is due to acceleration from another companion in the system, we show that such a companion is capable of explaining the polar and mildly eccentric orbit of GJ 3470b using two different secular excitation models. The existence of an outer companion can be further constrained with additional RV observations, Gaia astrometry, and future high-contrast imaging observations. Lastly, we show that tidal heating from GJ 3470b’s mild eccentricity has most likely inflated the radius of GJ 3470b by a factor of ∼1.5–1.7, which could help account for its evaporating atmosphere."

So far, no other substellar companions have been unambiguously confirmed via direct imaging around main-sequence stars in Hyades. The star HIP 21152 is an accelerating star as identified by the astrometry from the Gaia and Hipparcos satellites. We detected the companion, HIP 21152 B, in multiple epochs using the high-contrast imaging from SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2. We also obtained the stellar radialvelocity data from the Okayama 188 cm telescope. The CHARIS spectroscopy reveals that HIP 21152 B’s spectrum is consistent with the L/T transition, best fit by an early T dwarf. Our orbit modeling determines the semimajor axis and the dynamical mass of HIP 21152 B to be  17 <sup>+7.2</sup><sub style='position: relative; left: -2em;'>−3.8</sub> and 27.8 <sup>+8.4</sup><sub style='position: relative; left: -2em;'>−5.4</sub> <i>M<sub>Jub</sub></i>, respectively. The mass ratio of HIP 21152 B relative to its host is ≈2%, near the planet/brown dwarf boundary suggested by recent surveys. Mass estimates inferred from luminosity-evolution models are slightly higher (33–42 MJup). With a dynamical mass and a well-constrained age due to the system’s Hyades membership, HIP 21152 B will become a critical benchmark in understanding the formation, evolution, and atmosphere of a substellar object as a function of mass and age. Our discovery is yet another key proof of concept for using precision astrometry to select direct-imaging targets."

Yet Lyαobservations are notoriously challenging owing to severe attenuation from interstellar gas, hindering our understanding of this important emission line’s basic morphology. We present high-resolution far- and near-UV spectroscopy of five G, K, and M dwarfs with radial velocities large enough to Doppler-shift the stellar Lyαemission line away from much of the interstellar attenuation, allowing the line core to be directly observed. We detect self-reversal in the Lyαemission-line core for all targets, and we show that the self-reversal depth decreases with increasing surface gravity. Mg II self-reversed emission-line profiles provide some useful information to constrain the Lyαline core, but the differences are significant enough that Mg II cannot be used directly as an intrinsic Lyαtemplate during reconstructions. We show that reconstructions that neglect self-reversal could overestimate intrinsic Lyαfluxes by as much as 60%–100% for G and K dwarfs and 40%–170% for M dwarfs. The five stars of our sample have low magnetic activity and subsolar metallicity; a larger sample size is needed to determine how sensitive these results are to these factors."

Until now, no planetary system models contained all of the basic physics necessary to enable study with all of the major exoplanet detection methods. Here we introduce a suite of such models generated by a new tool, exoVista. The exoVista tool quickly generates thousands of models of quasi-self-consistent planetary systems around known nearby stars at scattered light wavelengths and efficiently records the position, velocity, spectrum, and physical parameters of all bodies as functions of time. The modeled planetary systems can be used to simulate surveys using the direct imaging, transit, astrometric, and radial velocity techniques, as well as the overlap of these different methods."

Fe-based amorphous ribbons were annealed for systematically varied laser power. Extremely high heating and cooling rates on the order of 10(exp 8)-10(exp 10)K/s have been estimated by finite element analysis simulations. Observations suggest surface melting followed by rapid solidification fast enough to quench and form an amorphous structure upon cooling. Diffusion of heat occurs from the laser irradiated surface region so that a finite volume of material surrounding this region rises in temperature above the crystallization temperature relevant for conventional isothermal annealing experiments. The underlying mechanism of laser annealing and consequences of heat transients involved are discussed in terms of impacts upon micro/nanostructure, residual stresses, and magnetic domain structure surrounding the laser irradiated region. The study illustrates the potential to exploit spatially optimized phase transformations in a scalable manufacturing process of amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys to locally access otherwise inaccessible extreme heating and cooling rates."

The key factor is the unique Lissajous orbital viewing geometry from the Lagrangian L1 point, which enables a continuous view of Earth’s sunlit hemisphere. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR) is the DSCOVR Mission energy budget instrument, which views the reflected and emitted radiation of the Earth’s sunlit hemisphere by means of single pixel active cavity full-spectrum (Band-A, 0.2–100 μm) and filtered solar wavelength (Band-B, 0.2–4.0 μm; and Band-C, 0.7–4.0 μm) radiometer measurements. An additional solar wavelength photodiode channel (0.3–1.1 μm) provides a calibration reference. The objective of this study is the assessment of climate GCM performance via direct model/data comparisons. Such comparisons are difficult due to quasi-chaotic natural variability present in real-world observational data and in climate GCM simulations. This is where the unique DSCOVR viewing geometry makes possible the longitudinal data slicing methodology for more direct model/data comparison. The key point of the longitudinal slicing approach is that data integration over the entire sunlit hemisphere eliminates the quasi-chaotic meteorological weather-scale noise, while preserving intra-seasonal and planetary-scale variability. The rotation of the Earth that retrieves this climate-style, large-scale longitudinal and seasonal variability. The hemispheric averaging is accomplished automatically in NISTAR measurements with its single-pixel view of the Earth. For climate GCMs, this requires implementing the Sunlit Hemisphere Sampling (SHS) scheme to operate on the GCM run-time output data, utilizing the DSCOVR Satellite Ephemeris data to assure precise viewing geometry between NISTAR measurements and GCM output data, while averaging out the meteorological weather noise. However, GCM generated data are radiative fluxes, while NISTAR (and EPIC) measurements are near-backscattered radiances. Conversing NISTSR measurements into radiative fluxes cannot be accomplished using NISTAR data alone, even with detailed support from conventional satellite data. But the identical viewing geometry of Earth’s sunlit hemisphere, and synergistic analyses of EPIC data make it feasible for this conversion of NISTAR near-backscatter radiances into radiative fluxes."

We run a 3-D time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic model to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of magnetic field and plasma distributions over the course of one planetary rotation. We perform eight simulation cases under solar minimum quiet-solar-wind conditions (four equinox/solstice seasons, each with two interplanetary magnetic field polarities) and in an actual interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) case to assess quiet and space weather situations, respectively. The occurrence of detectable discrete aurora is subject to the combination of the probabilities that (a) the ionosphere is magnetically connected with high altitudes through open field lines and (b) precipitating energy fluxes of >30 eV electrons exceed 0.1 erg/cm2/s. Our results show that during quiet solar activity, discrete aurora occurs likely on small-scale patches embedded inside strong crustal magnetic field regions (with a magnitude greater than 50 nT at 150 km), and the overall chance across the globe is ∼0.77%. The higher probability over strong crustal field regions is attributed to the stronger magnetic field convergence. Modeling shows the occurrence probability dramatically increases during the ICME event, particularly by more than an order of magnitude in weak crustal field regions. Our model results reasonably agree with NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN and Mars Express observations. Our study suggests that nightside discrete electron aurora is not caused by the direct entry of magnetosheath plasma in a cusp-like process but due to the recycling of nightside magnetospheric electrons."

However, these missions are infrequent; Uranus and Neptune have only had a single flyby by Voyager 2. The Hubble Space Telescope, particularly the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) instruments, and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics systems have enabled high spatial resolution imaging at a higher cadence, and over a longer time, than can be achieved with targeted missions to these worlds. These facilities offer a powerful combination of high spatial resolution, often <0.05”, and broad wavelength coverage, from the ultraviolet through the near infrared, resulting in compelling studies of the clouds, winds, and atmospheric vertical structure. This coverage allows comparisons of atmospheric properties between the planets, as well as in different regions across each planet. Temporal variations in winds, cloud structure, and color over time scales of days to years, have been measured for all four planets. With several decades of data already obtained, we can now begin to investigate seasonal influences on dynamics and aerosol properties, despite orbital periods ranging from 12 to 165 years. Future facilities will enable even greater spatial resolution and, combined with our existing long record of data, will continue to advance our understanding of atmospheric evolution on the giant planets."

While remote sensing is extensively used, some crucial observations require in-situ measurements by an atmospheric probe. Given their scientific importance, probe missions to Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are considered for the coming decades. In anticipation of future probe missions, the software tool VIPRE was developed as proof-of-concept to facilitate selection of probe entry locations. Currently, there is no analytical way to identify which interplanetary trajectory from thousands of feasible launch opportunities is optimal for a considered mission concept. The search and decision process for that solution is complex and relies on the intuition of mission designers, who focus on a subset of trajectories to make the trade space manageable. The idea of VIPRE is to (1) generate a multi-dimensional data cube showing relevant engineering and science parameters simultaneously for thousands of trajectories, and (2) visualize the data for all entry sites over the body's envelope. VIPRE lays the foundation to make the data available for browsing in a 3-D visualization to identify the best family of solutions for a given mission. The paper introduces the validated and verified core algorithms of VIPRE, published on GitHub. VIPRE serves as a basic framework to be used and extended for different purposes. The paper presents the motivation for the development and algorithms. It explains the computation and data visualization strategy, and gives a list of suggested functionalities to extend and further develop VIPRE to fully leverage its potential."

hydrogen in amorphous silica and quantify the planetary science implications of these findings.
Previous MD simulations had a large range of predicted values and did not agree well with
experiment. Our simulations sample atomic motion for a longer duration and consider a wider
range of temperatures than previous simulations. In contrast to constant atomic motion, the
hydrogen atoms were shown to undergo random intermittent jumps from one oxygen atom to
another, the number of which increase with temperature. Predicted diffusion coefficients had a
better agreement to experimental values than previous MD simulations, suggesting the
importance of longer simulation durations for better statistics. The low activation energy and
jumps observed at lunar temperatures do not support the theory of diurnal variations in OH
content for an undamaged amorphous silica surface. Instead, we conclude that energetic solar
wind impacts can induce two competing atomic hydrogen motion processes in the exposed
surface: A prompt effect that induces jumps in the temperature spike volume, but also a long term
effect of damage in the structure that traps atomic hydrogen. We then use SDTrimSP to
quantify the damage created during exposure and MD to demonstrate the H retention and
trapping near these defects. Damage was shown to be dependent on impact energy, with
defects easily retaining implanted hydrogen. MD results like those presented herein on
unweathered surfaces are therefore most relevant to magnetic anomalies. As a result, we
demonstrate the importance of lunar volatile models to account for the damage state of the
substrate when modelling hydrogen diffusion, retention, and subsequent OH/water production."

Multiple on-going projects involve large numbers of independent measurements of backscatter, as well as other biologically relevant parameters, to understand how biology is changing in time and space throughout the global ocean. Rarely are there sufficient measurements to test how well these instruments are inter-calibrated in real-world deployment conditions. This paper develops a procedure to align multiple independently calibrated backscatter instruments to each other using nearby profiling casts and applies this method to nine instruments deployed during a recent field campaign in the North Pacific during August–September of 2018. This process revealed several incorrect calibrations; post-alignment, all nine instruments aligned extremely well with each other. We also tested an alignment to a deep-water reference and found that this method is generally sufficient but has significant limitations; this procedure lacks the ability to correct instruments measuring only shallow profiles and can only account for additive offsets, not multiplicative changes. These findings highlight the utility of process studies involving several independent measurements of similar parameters in the same area."

Here we present a simple metric developed from a global dataset spanning blue, green and brown water types to assess the quality of a measured or derived aquatic spectrum. The Quality Water Index Polynomial (QWIP) is founded on the Apparent Visible Wavelength (AVW), a one-dimensional geophysical metric of color that is inherently correlated to spectral shape calculated as a weighted harmonic mean across visible wavelengths. The QWIP represents a polynomial relationship between the hyperspectral AVW and a Normalized Difference Index (NDI) using red and green wavelengths. The QWIP score
represents the difference between a spectrum’s AVW and NDI and the QWIP polynomial. The approach is tested extensively with both raw and quality controlled field data to identify spectra that fall outside the general trends observed in aquatic optics. For example, QWIP scores less than or greater than 0.2 would fail an initial screening and be subject to additional quality control. Common outliers tend to have spectral features related to: 1) incorrect removal of surface reflected skylight or 2) optically shallow water. The approach was applied to hyperspectral imagery from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO), as well as to multispectral imagery from the Visual Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) using sensor-specific extrapolations to approximate AVW. This simple approach can be rapidly implemented in ocean color processing chains to provide a level of
uncertainty about a measured or retrieved spectrum and flag questionable or unusual spectra for further analysis."

Traditional methods of validating satellite algorithms with data from water samples are often inhibited by the expense of quantifying cyanobacteria indicators in the field and the lack of public data. However, state recreation advisories and other recorded events of cyanoHAB occurrence reported by local authorities can serve as an independent and publicly available dataset for validation. State recreation advisories were defined as a period delimited by a start and end date where a warning was issued due to detections of cyanoHABs over a state’s risk threshold. State reported events were defined as any event that was documented with a single date related to cyanoHABs.  This study examined the presence-absence agreement between 160 state reported cyanoHAB advisories and 1,343 events and cyanobacteria biomass estimated by a satellite algorithm called the Cyanobacteria Index (CI(cyano)). The true positive rate of agreement with state recreation advisories was 69% and 60% with state reported events. CI(cyano) detected a reduction or absence in cyanobacteria after 76% of the recreation advisories ended. CI(cyano) was used to quantify the magnitude, spatial extent, and temporal frequency of cyanoHABs; each of these three metrics were greater (r > 0.2) during state recreation advisories compared to non-advisory times with effect sizes ranging from small to large. This is the first study to quantitatively evaluate satellite algorithm performance for detecting cyanoHABs with state reported events and advisories and supports informed management decisions with satellite technologies that complement traditional field observations."

As part of AerChemMIP (Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project) all models conducted simulation experiments considering future climate (ssp370SST) and present-day climate (ssp370pdSST) under the same future emissions trajectory (SSP3-7.0). A multi-model global average climate change benefit on surface ozone of −0.96 ± 0.07 ppbv °C−1 is calculated which is mainly linked to the dominating role of enhanced ozone destruction with higher water vapour abundances under a warmer climate. Over regions remote from pollution sources, there is a robust decline in mean surface ozone concentration on an annual basis as well as for boreal winter and summer varying spatially from −0.2 to −2 ppbv °C−1, with strongest decline over tropical oceanic regions. The implication is that over regions remote from pollution sources (except over the Arctic) there is a consistent climate change benefit for baseline ozone due to global warming. However, ozone increases over regions close to anthropogenic pollution sources or close to enhanced natural biogenic volatile organic compounds emission sources with a rate ranging regionally from 0.2 to 2 ppbv C−1, implying a regional surface ozone penalty due to global warming. Overall, the future climate change enhances the efficiency of precursor emissions to generate surface ozone in polluted regions and thus the magnitude of this effect depends on the regional emission changes considered in this study within the SSP3_7.0 scenario. The comparison of the climate change impact effect on surface ozone versus the combined effect of climate and emission changes indicates the dominant role of precursor emission changes in projecting surface ozone concentrations under future climate change scenarios."

The C-ELS specimen has the advantage of a longer region of stable delamination propagation compared to the existing mode II benchmark case.  The new benchmark example may therefore provide a better assessment tool by enabling more stable crack growth in regions further away from the boundary conditions or load application.  First, a benchmark result is created manually using two-dimensional finite element models of the C-ELS specimen with different delamination lengths.  Second, the performance of the delamination propagation capabilities in the Abaqus/Standard finite element code are assessed by comparing the results to the benchmark case.  Two examples with different starter delamination lengths are studied.  A shorter starter length is chosen to create a scenario with unstable delamination propagation.  A longer delamination causes stable delamination propagation.  Detailed results from three-dimensional analyses with aligned and mis-aligned meshes and two levels of mesh refinement are provided for several permutations of numerical input parameters.  In general, good agreement can be achieved between the results obtained from the quasi-static propagation analysis and the benchmark analysis.  However, particular non-default settings are found to be most reliable, accurate, and numerically efficient.  Numerical artifacts including anomalous unreleased nodes in the crack wake and zig-zag crack fronts occur, and further development of the Abaqus/Standard VCCT propagation may be required.  Use of the benchmark case to assess the continuous improvements in one finite element code illustrates the value of establishing benchmark solutions."

These efforts have also resulted in the spin-off of two additional databases, one containing lakes and reservoirs (2.GREALD, area 10–99 sq. km), and the other containing ephemeral lakes (3.GELD, area ≥100 sq. km). These databases are unique sources for projects that utilize satellite radar altimeter data to monitor surface water levels. While 1.GREALD aims to be a complete catalog, 2.GREALD focuses on reservoirs in response to applied sciences programs that monitor water and energy resources. The creation of 3.GELD has climate change objectives as well as water resources and ecosystem conservation applications. The recording of information pertaining to the potential overpasses (waterbody crossings) of the current and archive satellite altimeters is a primary objective as is the need to highlight any form of controlled water level variation. The permanent water databases now contain 6282 entries, half experience some form of anthropogenic influence and ∼430 have been identified as potential climatically sensitive terminal lakes. The revised integral surface area distribution is a power law with exponent −1.016. Statistics reveal that with altimetric repeat visit times of 10-day to monthly, at least 80% of the permanent water bodies (≥10 sq. km) have been overflown at some period since the 1990s.

The confinement of particles in close proximity to the shocks, as well as particle scattering processes during propagation to the spacecraft, lead to the common observation of upstream diffuse particle distributions. We present observations of a rare extended anisotropic low-energy(≤30 keV)proton beam together with a trapped ≥500 keV proton population observed in association with the arrival of an oblique interplanetary shock at the Advanced Composition Explorer, the Interplanetary Monitoring Platform-8, and the Wind spacecraft on 2001 January 31. Continuous injection of particles by the traveling shock into a smooth radial magnetic field region formed in the tail of a modest high-speed solar wind stream produced an extended foreshock region of energetic particles. The absence of enhanced magnetic field fluctuations upstream of the shock results in the observation of a prolonged anisotropic field-aligned beam of ≤30 keV protons as well as a population of higher-energy(≥500 keV)protons with small pitch-angle cosine(μ∼0)extending far from the shock."

Climate Model to simulate a four-year duration volcanic SO2 emission of the scale of the Wapshilla

BECA uses active neutron and gamma ray spectroscopy to make these measurements and thus consists of a Pulsed Neutron Generator (PNG), a CeBr3 scintillator Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), and two He-3 neutron detectors. As shown in Figure 1, the PNG emits 14.1 MeV neutrons that induce lunar materials to emit gamma rays with energies characteristic of the elements that produced them. The GRS measures the energy spectra of these gamma rays to identify the elements present and establish their absolute concentrations in the regolith. The analysis of BECA’s gamma ray spectral data yields quantitative elemental concentrations by mass (wt.%) in the material directly beneath the lunar lander or rover. A Compact Neutron Monitor (CNM) attached to the PNG precisely measures the output of 14.1 MeV neutrons to enable quantification of absolute elemental abundances."

We took advantage of a monitoring campaign performed with NuSTAR, Swift/XRT, AstroSat and NICER, to follow the Be/X-ray Binary 2S 1553-542 along one of its rare outbursts and trace its spectral and timing evolution.  We report the discovery of a luminosity-dependent cyclotron line energy for the first time in this source. The pulse profiles and pulsed fraction also show variability along the outburst, consistently with the interpretation that the source transitions from the sub-critical to the super-critical accretion regime, separated by a critical luminosity ofLcrit≈4×1037erg/s."

Resono Pressure Systems, Inc. in partnership with the University of Wyoming have developed a unique hardware and software system for measuring unsteady pressure, which was implemented in a large-scale wind tunnel test through a nonreimbursable Space Act Agreement with NASA. The technique was applied to 12 pressure ports on the 1.75% scale SLS wind tunnel model. Tubing lengths of approximately 14 inches separated the pressure transducer module from the pressure taps on the model surface, and surface-mount validation sensors (Kulites) were installed in close proximity to 5 of the 12 pressure ports. Up to about 500 Hz, the frequency response of pressure fluctuations agreed to within 1 dB of amplitude and 10° of phase difference compared to the simultaneously-acquired surface-mount transducers. Sample results using the reconstructed pressure from the full azimuthal ring of taps are presented."

M. Keck Observatory on two post-perihelion dates(UT 2015 February 2 and 3).H2O was measured simultaneously with CO,CH3OH, H2CO, CH4, C2H6,C2H4, C2H2, HCN, and NH3 on both dates, and rotational temperatures, production rates, relative abundances, H2O ortho-to-para ratios, and spatial distributions in the coma were determined. The first detection of C2H4in a comet from ground-based observations is reported. Abundances relative to H2O for all species were found to be in the typical range compared with values for other comets in the overall population to date. There is evidence of variability in rotational temperatures and production rates on timescales that are small compared with the rotational period of the comet. Spatial distributions of volatiles in the coma suggest complex outgassing behavior.CH3OH, HCN, C2H6, and CH4 spatial distributions in the coma are consistent with direct release from associated ices in the nucleus and are peaked in a more sunward direction compared with co-measured dust. H2O spatial profiles are clearly distinct from these other four species, likely due to a sizable coma contribution from icy grain sublimation.Spatial distributions for C2H2,H2CO, and NH3suggest substantial contributions from extended coma sources, providing further evidence for distinct origins and associations for these species in comets. CO shows a different spatial distribution compared with other volatiles, consistent with jet activity from discrete nucleus ice sources."

The single-event burnout (SEB) failure is thermal runaway from second breakdown, initiated by impact ionization and terminated with mesoplasma formation, at the center of the P-pillar/N+ substrate interface. We also demonstrate that the SEB performance of this SiC SJ DMOSFET is insensitive to the pillar width but sensitive to the strike location with ion strike at the P-pillar causing SEB at a lower blocking voltage than at the N-pillar. Compared to commercially available 1.2 kV blocking-rated non-SJ DMOSFETs, which have been demonstrated to survive SEB up to 525 V, the SJ DMOSFET increases SEB survival threshold voltage (VSEB) by a factor of 2.2, making it close to 1200 V, while the on-resistance is increased by only 11%. Using our recently developed figure of merit (FoM), which considers the trade-off between VSEB and on-state performance, we find that the SiC SJ DMOSFET achieves a FoM that is 14 times better, making it superior to conventional 1.2 kV SiC DMOSFETs for long-term radiation-tolerant operation in space applications."

The spatial and temporal scales of the biotic and abiotic interactions establish the inherent dynamics of the coastal zone and the requirement for high-resolution investigations. Using match-up data collected in Hokkaido coastal waters, the study herein evaluated the performance of deriving chlorophyll (Chl) a concentration and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption (a(sub CDOM)) as a function of wavelength (λ) from satellite observations. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Second generation GLobal Imager (SGLI), which has 250 m spatial resolution, was compared with other satellite ocean color (OC) sensors. Our results show that the standard SGLI OC4 algorithm with the 530 nm band provided the best performance for Chl a retrievals, and the end-member analysis (EMA) technique improved the estimation of a(sub CDOM)(λ) . Overall differences between in situ radiometric data and satellite retrievals suggest that additional challenges remain, especially in the ultraviolet and blue spectral domains which are useful for studying CDOM and harmful algae blooms in coastal waters. To fulfill applications wherein high-quality remote sensing data are required, the improvement of the atmospheric correction is a likely research area where additional accomplishment will be beneficial for satellite observations of optically complex coastal waters."

Since nickel, as well as iron, is one of the most stable nuclei, the nickel energy spectrum and  its  relative  abundance  with  respect  to  iron  provide  important  information  to  estimate  the abundances at the source and to model the propagation of heavy nuclei.  However, only a few direct measurements  of  cosmic-ray  nickel  at  energy  larger  than∼3  GeV/n are  available  at  present  in the literature and they are affected by strong limitations in both energy reach and statistics.  In this paper we present a measurement of the differential energy spectrum of nickel from 8.8 GeV/nto 240 GeV/n, carried out with unprecedented precision by the Calorimetric Electron1 Telescope(CALET) in operation on the International Space Station since 2015.  The CALET instrument can identify individual nuclear species via a measurement of their electric charge with a dynamic range extending far beyond iron (up to atomic number Z = 40).  The particle’s energy is measured by a homogeneous calorimeter (1.2 proton interaction lengths, 27 radiation lengths) preceded by a thin imaging section (3 radiation lengths) providing tracking and energy sampling.  This paper follows our previous measurement of the iron spectrum [1] and it extends our investigation on the energy dependence of the spectral index of heavy elements.  It reports the analysis of nickel data collected from November 2015 to May 2021 and a detailed assessment of the systematic uncertainties.  In the region from 20 GeV/nto 240 GeV/n our present data are compatible within the errors with a single power law with spectral index−2.51±0.07."

They endure high-temperature oxidation and surface recession when re-entering Earth’s atmosphere. Ablation is the result of many coupled and competing thermal, mechanical, and chemical phenomena, and it is difficult to isolate the role of each on the overall degradation of the TPS. Here we develop an ablation model for material recession coupled explicitly to finite rate carbon oxidation in complex microstructures. In this work, Stochastic PArallel Rarified-gas Time-accurate Analyzer (SPARTA), a direct-simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code, is modified to allow oxidation-driven ablation of implicitly defined carbon surfaces. In SPARTA, implicit surfaces are generated from the grid corner point values via a marching cubes algorithm, therefore creating a new set of surface elements every time ablation is performed. The finite-rate oxidation model developed by Gopalan et. al, was adapted to tally surface reactions and other surface data on a per-grid cell basis. The ablation functionality was also adjusted so once the reactions have occurred, the number of reactions leading to CO formation can be converted to corner point reduction values; therefore, carbon removal is directly proportional to surface recession. We also develop robust algorithms which handle the evolution of the flow cells and solid material regions, including split cells (flow cell divided in two by a solid surface). Finally, we demonstrate our implicit chemistry model for 2D and 3D geometries by producing reaction statistics and detailed visualization of oxidation-induced material recession at the microscale."

To  mitigate  these effects, isolation systems can be used. In recent years, inerters have been studied as a part of different structural control methods. The inerter is attractive for many structural control methods because it can produce large mass effects despite having a small physical mass through the transformation of translational motion to the rotational motion of a flywheel. While inerters have been considered in structural control, experimental studies of isolation systems featuring inerters has been limited. This project seeks to study the ability of the addition of an inerter to improve the dynamic performance of isolation systems when considering a random vibration environment. The results of this study demonstrate that the inerter can have a large impact on the dynamic properties of an isolated system, including shifting the isolation mode frequency lower while reducing its amplitude. High frequency noise did result from the inclusion of the inerter but may not be of significant concern depending on the frequency range of interest. The strong performance of the inerter in a simplified isolation system observed during this work motivates future studies of inerters in isolation systems."

The algorithm starts by evaluating smooth segments of the diurnal time series of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance to identify clear-sky and snow-free observations. It then attempts to retrieve the Ross-Thick–Li-Sparse (RTLS) surface bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters and the daily mean atmospheric optical depth (AOD) with an atmospheric radiative transfer model (RTM) to optimally simulate the observed diurnal variability in the clear-sky TOA reflectance. Once the initial RTLS parameters are retrieved after the algorithm’s burn-in period, they serve as the prior information to estimate the AOD levels for the following days and update the surface BRDF information with the new clear-sky observations. This process is iterated through the full time span of the observations, skipping only totally cloudy days or when surface snow is detected. We tested the algorithm over various Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites and the retrieved results well agree with the ground-based measurements. This study demonstrates that the high-frequency diurnal geostationary observations contain unique information that can help to address the atmospheric correction problem from new directions."

(Math Program 180(1):285–310, 2020) by incorporating several new regularization functions and develop a regularized single-tree search method for solving convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. We propose a set of regularization functions based on distance metrics and Lagrangean approximations, used in the projection problem for finding new integer combinations to be used within the Outer-Approximation (OA) method. The new approach, called Regularized Outer-Approximation (ROA), has been implemented as part of the open-source Mixed-integer nonlinear decomposition toolbox for Pyomo—MindtPy. We compare the OA method with seven regularization function alternatives for ROA. Moreover, we extend the LP/NLP Branch and Bound method proposed by Quesada and Grossmann (Comput Chem Eng 16(10–11):937–947, 1992) to include regularization in an algorithm denoted RLP/NLP. We provide convergence guarantees for both ROA and RLP/NLP. Finally, we perform an extensive computational experiment considering all convex MINLP problems in the benchmark library MINLPLib. The computational results show clear advantages of using regularization combined with the OA method."

The non-linearity of cloud-state changes to aerosol perturbations make it challenging to attribute causality
in observed relationships of aerosol radiative forcing. Using correlations to infer causality can be challenging when meteorological variability also drives both aerosol and cloud changes independently. Natural and anthropogenic aerosol perturbations from well defined sources provide ‘opportunistic experiments’ (also known as natural experiments) to investigate ACI in cases where causality may be more confidently inferred. These perturbations cover a wide range of locations and spatio-temporal scales, including point sources such as volcanic eruptions or industrial sources, plumes from biomass burning or forest fires, and tracks from individual ships or shipping corridors.We review the different experimental conditions and conduct a synthesis of the available satellite data sets and field campaigns to place these opportunistic experiments on a common footing, facilitating new insights and a clearer understanding of key uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing. Cloud albedo perturbations are strongly sensitive to background meteorological conditions. Strong liquid water path increases due to aerosol perturbations are largely ruled out by averaging across experiments. Opportunistic experiments have significantly improved process-level understanding of ACI, but it remains unclear how reliably the relationships found can be scaled to the global level, thus demonstrating a need for deeper investigation in order to improve assessments of aerosol radiative forcing and climate change."

Groundwater recharge factors that influence the narrow recharge zone of the MSA include precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and landcover changes. The unsustainable water practices and increasing landcover change from urban development in the MSA's narrow recharge zone threaten the aquifer’s groundwater storage. In partnership with Protect Our Aquifer, the team used data from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM IMERG), National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). These datasets included annually-averaged precipitation, evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, biannual landcover change, and monthly total water storage which were used to create groundwater recharge factors maps and timeseries. The evaporative stress index map, water balance map, and landcover change maps were used to identify thriving areas. The team found precipitation did not express a strong linear trend and showed high precipitation years in 2017 and 2018, and a drought year in 2011. The potential evapotranspiration showed a weak negative linear trend. The landcover change showed shifts in forested areas and urban development. The team identified four thriving areas in the western side of Tennessee that successfully contribute to aquifer recharge due to increased forest area, sufficient water use, low changes in total water storage, and lateral positioning to streams. These end products allowed our partners to make informed decisions about areas that are thriving in the Mississippi Embayment recharge zone for conservation efforts of the aquifer."

The Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management (BOEM) has air quality jurisdiction offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and drafts regulations for criteria pollutants, while the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) enforces these regulations. Additionally, the non-profit organization SkyTruth monitors natural resources, including methane. BOEM, BSEE, and SkyTruth have partnered with NASA DEVELOP to use Earth observations to identify potential offshore methane sources in the Gulf of Mexico and to validate reported flaring activity. This information will allow BOEM and BSEE to make informed regulations regarding air pollution. Here, we cross-referenced BOEM infrastructure data with Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire data to validate operator-reported flaring. Sentinel-5p TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) pollutant concentrations were used to validate VIIRS-detected flaring outside of the Gulf of Mexico where operator-reported data is unavailable. Using these methods, we identified the locations of offshore oil and gas infrastructure with known episodic flaring and venting in 2017 in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as offshore of South America and West Africa in 2021. Drawing upon retrieval methods used to detect onshore methane emissions, we proposed an analogous method utilizing sunglint to illuminate methane plumes over the ocean using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) imagery.

When properly assessed, such a data record can be valuable in efforts of estimating severe storm risk throughout the diurnal cycle based on automated detection of patterns consistently found atop severe storms. Furthermore, environmental conditions favorable for severe weather are well-known and are thought to be represented well by modern reanalysis products. Promoting resilience against such hazards on local and global scales is a chief goal the NASA Disasters program, which seeks to encourage use of satellite observations to mitigate risk. For instance, hail is the costliest severe weather hazard across the globe in terms of insured loss, but reporting inconsistencies for hail events globally make it difficult to develop models that can quantify the risk. Satellite observation and model reanalysis taken together have the potential to, with reasonable skill and specificity, characterize environmental conditions that are favorable for hazardous weather, and thereby enable creation of hazard climatologie.  Such climatologies are particularly useful over regions without extensive radar networks or storm reporting. By mapping the multivariate combination of observed cloud features and reanalysis environmental parameters/indices to United States Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) radar-estimated Maximum Expected Size of Hail (MESH) by way of a deep neural network (DNN), estimates of likelihood for potentially severe hail can be produced. Such estimates are of greater complexity and efficiency than could be performed with previous multivariate or logistic regression analyses for observed points within convective systems. Statistical distributions of convective parameters from satellite and reanalysis are shown to highlight non-severe/severe class separation for well-known hailstorm predictors, e.g., overshooting cloud top characteristics, deep-layer wind shear, mid-level stability, helicity, and convective inhibition. These complex, multivariate predictor relationships are exploited within a DNN, which can efficiently produce a quantitative hail risk metric with better than 70% detection rate and under 30% false alarms. These hail classifications can then be aggregated across the satellite record to yield a hazard climatology for hail frequency and severity – knowledge of which is of particular interest to those who manage risk (e.g., insurers) and are seeking opportunities to identify hail-prone regions, particularly in developing nations. This NASA study uses satellite observations and model parameters in a DNN to perform climatological hailstorm analysis in support of catastrophe model development, with the hope of promoting risk resilience particularly in regions without adequate weather radar coverage."

Through the creation of the Monitoring of Vegetation Presence (MVP) tool in Google Earth Engine, the team produced a time series showing trends in enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from 1984 to 2021, as well as a habitat suitability map using a general model for all tree species. These provided the partner with visuals to communicate their reforestation efforts and guidance on where to apply their future efforts.

Among planetary dynamos, the magnetic field of Saturn stands out in its exceptional level of axisymmetry. One of its peculiar features is that the magnetic dipole mode is tilted with respect to the planetary rotation axis by only ≈0.007° or less. Numerical dynamo simulations performed in this context have had great difficulty in producing such small dipole tilt angles without introducing ad hoc ingredients such as a latitudinally varying heat flux pattern in the outer layers or stably stratified layers (SSLs). Here we present a numerical dynamo simulation that generates a highly axisymmetric dynamo with a dipole tilt of about ≈0.0008° on average. The model consists of a deep dynamo layer and an overlying low-conductivity layer but without any SSLs. We highlight a novel mechanism where strong differential rotation generated in the atmospheric layer penetrates into the dynamo region, helping to maintain a very small magnetic dipole tilt.

Plain Language Summary
Saturn's dipole-dominant magnetic field exhibits a very peculiar feature: the dipole component of the planetary magnetic field is tilted by less than ≈0.007° with respect to the planetary spin axis. Numerical simulations performed in this context suggest that if a spatial heat-flux variation is imposed, along with a stably stratified region, on top of an active dynamo layer, then small dipole tilt values can be realized. Here we present a model where extremely small dipole tilt values can be achieved without these ad hoc ingredients. Our simulations demonstrate that dynamo theory allows extremely small dipole tilt values in a relatively simple model configuration."

Selecting a sample collection site on Bennu’s surface was challenging due to the surprising lack of large ponded deposits of regolith particles exclusively fine enough (≤ 2 cm diameter) to be ingested by the spacecraft’s Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM). Here we describe the Sampleability Map of Bennu, which was constructed to aid in the selection of candidate sampling sites and to estimate the probability of collecting sufficient sample. “Sampleability” is a numeric score that expresses the compatibility of a given area’s surface properties with the sampling mechanism. The algorithm that determines sampleability is a best fit functional form to an extensive suite of laboratory testing outcomes tracking the TAGSAM performance as a function of four observable properties of the target asteroid. The algorithm and testing were designed to measure and subsequently predict TAGSAM collection amounts as a function of the minimum particle size, maximum particle size, particle size frequency distribution, and the tilt of the TAGSAM head off the surface. The sampleability algorithm operated at two general scales, consistent with the resolution and coverage of data collected during the mission. The first scale was global and evaluated nearly the full surface. Due to Bennu’s unexpected boulder coverage and lack of ponded
regolith deposits, the global sampleability efforts relied heavily on additional strategies to find and characterize regions of interest based on quantifying and avoiding areas heavily covered by material too large to be collected. The second scale was site-specific and used higher-resolution data to predict collected mass at a given contact location. The rigorous sampleability assessments gave the mission confidence to select the best possible sample collection site and directly enabled successful collection of hundreds of grams of material."

Multiple methods have been developed to address the problem of cloud detection in satellite imagery and a number of cloud masking algorithms have been developed for optical sensors but very few studies have carried out quantitative intercomparison of state-of-the-art methods in this domain. This paper summarizes results of the first Cloud Masking Intercomparison eXercise (CMIX) conducted within the Committee Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). CEOS is the forum for space agency coordination and cooperation on Earth observations, with activities organized under working groups. CMIX, as one such activity, is an international collaborative effort aimed at intercomparing cloud detection algorithms for moderate-spatial resolution (10–30 m) spaceborne optical sensors. The focus of CMIX is on open and free imagery acquired by the Landsat 8 (NASA/USGS) and Sentinel-2 (ESA) missions. Ten algorithms developed by nine teams from fourteen different organizations representing universities, research centers and industry, as well as space agencies (CNES, ESA, DLR, and NASA), are evaluated within the CMIX. Those algorithms vary in their approach and concepts utilized which were based on various spectral properties, spatial and temporal features, as well as machine learning methods. Algorithm outputs are evaluated against existing reference cloud mask datasets. Those datasets vary in sampling methods, geographical distribution, sample unit (points, polygons, full image labels), and generation approaches (experts, machine learning, sky images). Overall, the performance of algorithms varied depending on the reference dataset, which can be attributed to differences in how the reference datasets were produced. The algorithms were in good agreement for thick cloud detection, which were opaque and had lower uncertainties in their identification, in contrast to thin/semi-transparent clouds detection. Not only did CMIX allow identification of strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms and potential areas of improvements, but also the problems associated with the existing reference datasets. The paper concludes with recommendations on generating new reference datasets, metrics, and an analysis framework to be further exploited and additional input datasets to be considered by future CMIX activities."

The uncertainties are highest in the blue bands. The total radiance measured at the top of the atmosphere captures the instantaneous state of the atmosphere-ocean system: the in-water conditions, sky and Sun glint reflected from the wind-roughened ocean surface, as well as light scattered from molecules and aerosols in the atmosphere. Each of these components has associated uncertainties, and when combined with the additional uncertainties from the instrument noise and the atmospheric correction process, they contribute to the total uncertainty budget for the retrieved R_rs. We analyzed the contribution of each component uncertainties to the total R_rs uncertainties in SNPP-VIIRS level 2 products, taking advantage of the spectral differences between the components. We examined multiple scenes in the open ocean and coastal waters at spatial resolutions ranging from 2250 to 5250 m by comparing the retrieved R_rs to in situ measurements made at several AERONET-OC sites and at the MOBY site. It was shown that uncertainties associated with the molecular (Rayleigh) scattering play the most significant role, while the contributions of other components are usually smaller. Uncertainties in Rayleigh scattering are primarily attributed to the variability of Rayleigh optical thickness (ROT) with a standard deviation of approximately 1.5% of ROT, which can largely explain the frequency of negative R_rs retrievals as observed using the current standard atmospheric correction process employed by NASA. Variability of the sky light reflected from the ocean surface in some conditions also contributed to uncertainties in the blue; water variability proportional to R_rs had a very pronounced peak in the green at coastal sites."

The precision thermal control (PTC) project was a multiyear effort initiated in fiscal year 2017 to mature the technology readiness level (TRL) of technologies required to enable ultra-thermally stable ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope primary-mirror assemblies for ultra-high-contrast observations of exoplanets. PTC had three objectives: (1) validate thermal optical performance models, (2) derive thermal system stability specifications, and (3) demonstrate multi-zonal active thermal control. PTC successfully achieved its objectives and matured active thermal control technology to at least TRL-5. PTC’s key accomplishments are a demonstration of better than 2-mK root-mean-square stable thermal control of the 1.5-m ultra-low expansion (ULE®) Advanced Mirror Technology Development-2 (AMTD-2) mirror when exposed to thermal disturbances in a relevant thermal/vacuum environment, and the ability to
shape the 1.5-m AMTD-2 mirror to picometer precision. Additionally, an analysis approach is demonstrated for quantifying thermally induced mid-spatial frequency error which can cause speckle noise in the coronagraph dark hole."

The Gray-Equivalent applies an RBE (Relative Biological Effectiveness) to the dose seen at the organ of interest in a human phantom.  The current design basis solar particle event was used in the assessments along with the August 1972 event modeled by J.H. King and with idealized spheres and two vehicle designs.  Three different algorithms were used and compared.  One of the algorithms was the current OLTARIS algorithm.  This algorithm is astronaut orientation averaged, which is not what happens in a storm shelter during a solar particle event.  Two other algorithms were proposed to eliminate this issue.  It is clear that either algorithm will be adequate to satisfy NASA-STD-3001 requirements.  This work recommends the algorithm which applies the RBEs to the phantom points instead of at the surface of the phantom as with the current OLTARIS algorithm."

This collaborative investigation addresses key objectives of the NASA Advanced Air Transport Technology (AATT) Project, in terms of reduction in fuel consumption and lower emission. It specifically targets the goals set forth in a roadmap developed by the NASA/Boeing team. The roadmap is a result of a series of meetings held between the two parties over the years and it represents a shared vision for practical implementations, leading up to flight demonstrations of localized flow control. If successful, localized flow control may lead to important ramifications for next generation airplanes from both the economic and environmental perspectives.

Under this contract localized AFC has been used to improve aerodynamic performance during high-lift operations using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Specifically, AFC has been applied at the aileron and at various location in the wing leading edge (LE) regions. The applications target reduced drag and enhanced lift over the range of practical angles of attack, including stall. These benefits translate to airplane performance improvements, such as longer range or larger payload. The CFD results are used to quantify potential aerodynamic benefits, as well as the input required for actuation. This helps identify the most promising candidates, which potentially provide material net airplane level enhancements using onboard fluidic sources.

The airplane configuration selected for the CFD study is a representative of a future short/medium-range twin-engine airplane dubbed the Reference Aircraft. A slew of AFC applications has been explored and their aerodynamic performance enhancements were benchmarked against the baseline Reference Aircraft. Promising AFC candidates have been deemed practical and potentially suitable for both the aileron and the wing LE implementations. The findings on the Reference Aircraft are used to guide the development of the AFC-enhanced aileron for the CRM-HL. The wind-tunnel model of the CRM-HL will be used by NASA to validate the AFC concepts, complementing the CFD-based analysis and the integration study (final report document #3)."

The conceptual integration study identifies potential promising localized wing AFC application opportunities for high-lift conditions using energy sources for modern aircraft.

Numerous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), both civil and military, are in use today. Operation at their design flight condition often requires rotors, propellers, or wings to perform at Reynolds numbers significantly below 500,000 [1].

Airfoil performance at low Reynolds numbers is generally characterized by low aerodynamic performance (i.e. the attainable lift-to-drag ratio) compared to performance of airfoils at higher Reynolds numbers. The critical chord-based Reynolds number for conventional airfoils lies around Rec = 100,000 to Rec = 500,000 [2]. Below this critical Reynolds number, laminar separation of the boundary layer is usually the cause for poor performance. Researchers have found that below the critical Reynolds number, flat and cambered plates can outperform smooth airfoils. Circular-arc cambered plates especially have remarkable performance advantages compared to conventional airfoil shapes [3]."

Historically, the Army Corps of Engineers has conducted dredging efforts to thwart erosion. Quantifying spatial and temporal variations of shoreline change is vital to understanding the interaction of land loss and historical dredging efforts. NASA DEVELOP collaborated with the National Park Service to use remote sensing to investigate the impact of dredging on Padre Island National Seashore’s shoreline. The team utilized high-resolution imagery from Maxar and Planet to create a time series of shoreline changes between 2011 and 2020, conduct shoreline extraction, and quantify shoreline changes. Additionally, the team monitored turbidity and sediment dynamics using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 4 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 5 TM, and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). Shoreline change results demonstrated an average change between 4.5 to 32 meters annually. Meanwhile, the dredging area directly north of the seashore’s Port Mansfield Channel experienced an areal gain of 152,000 m² between 2010 and 2021. The team also observed that turbidity values increased in areas close to the channel where dredging occurred, especially in the 2018 and 2021 dredging years. Dredging years corresponded with less shoreline change than years without dredging. These results will be used to better inform future partner-designed shoreline management projects in the face of continued erosion and sea level rise."

Of particular interest are schemes where a small number of pilots operate a large number of vehicles, mitigating high cost and pilot shortage issues. Such architectures require increased levels of automation and supervisory control modes. They also require ensuring safe operations when the command and control link to the vehicle is degraded or lost completely, rendering the vehicle autonomous.  To evaluate these variable and dynamic architectures, this paper will present a framework for decomposing the functions necessary to ensure safe, orderly, and expeditious air travel, assessing the agents in the system, and classifying the levels of autonomy. Then, an example allocation to agents of roles for the function of separation assurance is presented, highlighting the dependency of the allocation on three main factors; time criticality of a potential separation violation, the ratio of pilots to vehicles, and the loss of the command and control link."

Using the Apollo missions as historical evidence, dust will be a significant obstacle in the success of a sustained human and robotic presence. Hardware such as tools, machinery, extra-vehicular activity (EVA) suits, and components of landers and habitats will all be subject to various degrees of contamination by lunar dust, and each piece of hardware has its own considerations for performance under dusty conditions. Such hardware must be tested and verified for use during lunar missions under guidance from NASA technical standards. Aerosolized dust can be used to test and verify hardware in two ways: volumetric and surface area loading. Volumetric loading (measured in mass of airborne dust per volume of air) may cause hardware to malfunction via dust ingestion or other mechanisms. Surface area loading (measured in mass of settled dust per surface area) may cause hardware to malfunction by altering its thermal properties or by fouling optical surfaces such as camera lenses. This publication describes a method to achieve a stable, user-determined volumetric loading in an arbitrary chamber along with recommendations for how to use such chambers for customized hardware testing."

Geochronologic analyses will be among the key measurements planned for returned samples. Assessing a sample’s shock history will be critical because shock metamorphism could influence apparent sample age. Shock effects in one Mars-relevant mineral class, plagioclase feldspar, have been well- documented using various spectroscopy techniques (thermal infrared reflectance, emission, and transmission spectroscopy, Raman, and luminescence). A subset of these data will be obtained with the SuperCam and SHERLOC (Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals) instruments onboard Perseverance to inform caching decisions for MSR. Here, we review shock indicators in plagioclase feldspar as revealed in Raman, luminescence, and IR spectroscopy lab data, with an emphasis on Raman spectroscopy. We consider how this information may inform caching decisions for selecting optimal samples for geochronology measurements. We then identify challenges and make recommendations for both in situ measurements performed with SuperCam and SHERLOC and for supporting lab studies to enhance the success of geochronologic analyses after return to Earth."

The latency can be substantial especially when satellite-based beyond-radio-line-of-sight communication and relay through the aircraft are employed. This study uses voice recordings of controller-pilot communications and aircraft track data to establish a baseline of pilot readback latencies and maneuver detection delays in the current piloted operations. A machine learning pipeline was developed to parse the contents of the air traffic control clearances including the callsigns using natural language processing. After manually validating the results obtained using the pipeline, the average pilot readback latency was found to be about 0.6 seconds. The average latency between the end of maneuver (inferred from track data), initiated by the pilot in response to the clearance, and the end of clearance was found to be about 176 seconds for altitude change commands, 69 seconds for heading change commands, and 182 seconds for speed change commands. The average latency between the beginning of maneuver and the end of clearance was found to be about 17 seconds for altitude change commands, 17seconds for heading change commands, and 25 seconds for speed change commands."

Under CSM, operators are responsible for maintaining separation. The CSM concept is enabled by sharing Operational Intent (OI) among the operators to ensure common situation awareness. The OI is represented as four-dimensional (time and space) information that indicates where an aircraft would be contained within the space and time, with a known level of confidence. However, each vehicle’s ability to stay within its region of OI may differ based on each vehicle’s performance characteristics, resulting in varying OI sizes among the vehicles. Such varying OI size could adversely affect efficient and fair access to the airspace. In this paper, an OI-generation algorithm under varying OI size restriction with Containment Confidence Level (CCL) is presented. High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) balloon operations are used as an example application. A framework is presented by which CCL information is used in the deconfliction process. A fast-time simulation experiment is conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework. The simulation results show a reduced number of unnecessary deconfliction actions."

This study investigated whether use of the countermeasure lower-body negative pressure during spaceflight was associated with changes in ocular structure.

Objective:  To determine whether changes to the optic nerve head and retina during spaceflight can be mitigated by brief in-flight application of 25-mm Hg lower-body negative pressure.

Design, Setting, and Participants:  In the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s “Fluid Shifts Study,” a prospective cohort study, optical coherence tomography scans of the optic nerve head and macula were obtained from US and international crew members before flight, in-flight, and up to 180 days after return to Earth. In-flight scans were obtained both under normal weightless conditions and 10 to 20 minutes into lower-body negative pressure exposure. Preflight and postflight data were collected in the seated, supine, and head-down tilt postures. Crew members completed 6- to 12-month missions that took place on the International Space Station. Data were analyzed from 2016 to 2021.

Interventions or Exposures:  Spaceflight and lower-body negative pressure.

Main Outcomes and Measures:  Changes in minimum rim width, optic cup volume, Bruch membrane opening height, peripapillary total retinal thickness, and macular thickness.

Results:  Mean (SD) flight duration for the 14 crew members (mean [SD] age, 45 [6] years; 11 male crew members [79%]) was 214 (72) days. Ocular changes on flight day 150, as compared with preflight seated, included an increase in minimum rim width (33.8 μm; 95% CI, 27.9-39.7 μm; P < .001), decrease in cup volume (0.038 mm^3; 95% CI, 0.030-0.046 mm^3; P < .001), posterior displacement of Bruch membrane opening (−9.0 μm; 95% CI, −15.7 to −2.2 μm; P = .009), and decrease in macular thickness (fovea to 500 μm, 5.1 μm; 95% CI, 3.5-6.8 μm; P < .001). Brief exposure to lower-body negative pressure did not affect these parameters.

Conclusions and Relevance:  Results of this cohort study suggest that peripapillary tissue thickening, decreased cup volume, and mild central macular thinning were associated with long-duration spaceflight. Acute exposure to 25-mm Hg lower-body negative pressure did not alter optic nerve head or retinal morphology, suggesting that longer durations of a fluid shift reversal may be needed to mitigate spaceflight-induced changes and/or other factors are involved."

Monitoring tools, measures, and countermeasures are aimed at enhancing team processes and team composition configurations to optimize team performance and functioning. Long-duration exploration missions (LDEMs) will include major challenges that could affect team performance, including social isolation, physical confinement, a small and diverse crew, communication delays between crew and ground, limited or no crew rotation or evacuation options, limited or no resupply, and a high-consequence environment. Each of these conditions will affect the crew’s coordination, cooperation, psychological well-being, and performance. 

Although the International Space Station (ISS) remains important for studies that require spaceflight testing and validation, the current conditions on the ISS do not adequately mimic the exploration environment that is required for National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) teams research, and thus access to terrestrial or ground-based analogs of LDEM conditions is paramount. The emphasis on analogs for research is reflected in this updated evidence review of the Team Risk, and includes data from studies conducted at isolated, confined, extreme (ICE) environments (e.g., Antarctic stations), and from several mission simulation analogs such as the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) (HERA Experiment Information Package, 2014), also known as isolated, confined, controlled (ICC) environments. These studies have characterized many team factors regarding LDEMs, and the Team Risk has now matured from risk characterization to focusing more on countermeasure development.

Because spaceflight evidence for team-level research is lacking, no reliable data is available to quantify the impact of team-level variables on individual and team-level outcomes during spaceflight missions. Until recently, no systematic attempt had been undertaken to measure the performance effects of team cohesion, team composition, team training, or team-related psychosocial adaptation during spaceflight. The Team Risk is a relatively young research area for NASA, with substantial growth only since the 2000s, and with limited access to spaceflight performance data. As a result, spaceflight evidence is lacking to identify specifically what team composition, level of training, amount of cohesion, or quality of psychosocial adaptation is necessary to reduce the risk of performance errors in space. However, astronaut journals and interviews and reports from spaceflight subject matter experts (SMEs) provide testimonies that team performance during spaceflight is important for mission success and to maintain crew health. Team spaceflight data is now being collected as part of the Spaceflight Standard Measures task (Clement, 2021)—a set of core measurements related to many human spaceflight risks that are collected from astronauts before, during, and after long-duration missions. The team-related standard measures focus on team cohesion, team performance, group living, team climate, and team processes. Collection of standard measures data is ongoing and published data is not yet available. Finally, although spaceflight evidence is lacking, evidence gleaned from ground studies and spaceflight analog studies will help close the gaps outlined in the Team Risk. 

Ground-based studies provide quantitative evidence for team functioning in ICE environments. Academic research on teams has produced dozens of meta-analyses that can be used to understand the general relationships among team inputs (e.g., team member characteristics and skills, job context), team processes, and emergent states (e.g., coordination, communication, cooperation, cohesion, trust, shared cognition), and team outcomes (e.g., effectiveness, errors, adaptation). Teams are complex, incorporating individual characteristics of team members, but also existing at a level that is greater than the sum of its parts. Therefore, the Team Risk must be integrated with other individual-focused NASA Human Research Program (HRP) risks, including Behavioral Medicine (BMed), Sleep, and Human-Systems Integration Architecture (HSIA), and emerging research indicates more integration may needed between the Team Risk and the physiologically oriented risks. Much of this integration occurs through the Human Systems Risk Board (HSRB). 

A lack of team functioning may be a stressor in some circumstances, but the team often acts as a countermeasure. For example, support for team leaders and teammates can facilitate individual functioning and encourage psychological and physically healthy behaviors and attitudes. However, more research is needed regarding teams during LDEMs and the remaining gaps in the research are described in the current report."

However, little quantitative capability is available to assess these metrics of cyanoHABs across broad geographic scales and at regular intervals. Here, the spatial extent was quantified from a cyanobacteria algorithm applied to two European Space Agency satellite platforms—the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard Envisat and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3. CyanoHAB spatial extent was defined for each geographic area as the percentage of valid satellite pixels that exhibited cyanobacteria above the detection limit of the satellite sensor. This study quantified cyanoHAB spatial extent for over 2,000 large lakes and reservoirs across the contiguous United States (CONUS) during two time periods: 2008–2011 via MERIS and 2017–2020 via OLCI when cloud-, ice-, and snowfree imagery was available. Approximately 56% of resolvable lakes were glaciated, 13% were headwater, isolated, or terminal lakes, and the rest were primarily drainage lakes. Results were summarized at national-, regional-, state-, and lake-scales, where regions were defined as nine climate regions which represent climatically consistent states. As measured by satellite, changes in national cyanoHAB extent did have a strong increase of 6.9% from 2017 to 2020 (|Kendall’s tau (τ)| = 0.56; gamma (γ) = 2.87 years), but had negligible change (|τ| = 0.03) from 2008 to 2011. Two of the nine regions had moderate (0.3 ≤ |τ| < 0.5) increases in spatial extent from 2017 to 2020, and eight of nine regions had negligible (|τ| < 0.2) change from 2008 to 2011. Twelve states had a strong or moderate increase from 2017 to 2020 (|τ| ≥ 0.3), while only one state had a moderate increase and two states had a moderate decrease from 2008 to 2011. A decrease, or no change, in cyanoHAB spatial extent did not indicate a lack of issues related to cyanoHABs. Sensitivity results of randomly omitted daily CONUS scenes confirm that even with reduced data availability during a short four-year temporal assessment, the direction and strength of the changes in spatial extent remained consistent. We present the first set of national maps of lake cyanoHAB spatial extent across CONUS and demonstrate an approach for quantifying past and future changes at multiple spatial scales. Results presented here provide water quality managers information regarding current cyanoHAB spatial extent and quantify rates of change."

validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools. To that end, we find that now more than ever, flow visualization is a powerful capability that provides context to the experimental results bringing real-time insight to the researcher. It enables us to answer questions like: “Why does this drag polar look different?” or “What is the source of this tone in the microphone data?”. Flow visualization can verify that assumptions made in the CFD model are correct, addressing  questions like: “Are our trip dots the correct size and location?” or “Does the position of this shock match our prediction?”. Techniques such as infrared flow visualization and schlieren / shadowgraph are powerful capabilities that when taken together can provide results as to the nature of the fluid structure interaction at a test condition in a format that pairs well with computational results. When properly integrated these measurements can be taken with no impact on the productivity of the test program, supplementing traditional measurements and often discovering something unforeseen, helping the researcher to answer those slippery aerodynamic questions and ultimately build confidence in the accuracy of a model."

This database includes 290 sites previously reported by the International Heat Flow Commission (IHFC), for which we now standardize measurement and metadata quality. This database also includes 129 new sites, which have not been previously reported by the IHFC. These new sites consist of 88 offshore measurements and 41 onshore measurements, of which 24 are subglacial. We employ machine learning to synthesize these in situ measurements into a gridded geothermal heat flow model that is consistent across both continental and marine areas in and around Greenland. This model has a native horizontal resolution of 55 km. In comparison to five existing Greenland geothermal heat flow models, our model has the lowest mean geothermal heat flow for Greenland onshore areas. Our modeled heat flow in central North Greenland is highly sensitive to whether the NGRIP (North GReenland Ice core Project) elevated heat flow anomaly is included in the training dataset. Our model's most distinctive spatial feature is pronounced low geothermal heat flow (< 40 mW m−2) across the North Atlantic Craton of southern Greenland. Crucially, our model does not show an area of elevated heat flow that might be interpreted as remnant from the Icelandic plume track. Finally, we discuss the substantial influence of paleoclimatic and other corrections on geothermal heat flow measurements in Greenland. The in situ measurement database and gridded heat flow model, as well as other supporting materials, are freely available from the GEUS Dataverse (https://doi.org/10.22008/FK2/F9P03L; Colgan and Wansing, 2021)."

This research was aimed at providing a representative reference case for comparison with an Active Flow Control (AFC) enabled version of the CRM-HL and to increase the existing experimental database for CFD high-lift prediction.  The test was conducted mostly at a freestream Mach number of 0.20.  The effects of the engine nacelle, nacelle chine, tufts, small variations in Mach number, hysteresis-associated increasing/decreasing angle of attack, and incoming floor boundary-layer thickness (i.e., thinning by activation of the floor boundary layer removal system) were examined.  A prestall lift performance degradation for the CRM-HL configuration was resolved with a properly placed nacelle chine.  Surface pressure results are presented in detail for three key variants of CRM-HL — baseline (nacelle on), nacelle off, and nacelle with the most effective chine installation.  The presented aerodynamic forces and surface pressures include both with and without the wall correction using the Transonic Wall Interference Correction System (TWICS) method.

In this study, using the in-situ (Radiosonde, Ozonesonde, backscatter sonde and cryogenic frost-point hygrometer) observations from multiple locations in India (Gadanki (13.45° N, 79.18° E), Hyderabad (17.47° N, 78.58° E) and Varanasi (25.27° N, 82.99° E)) and multi-satellite observations ((Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Observation, (CALIPSO), Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) and Constellation Observation System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) Global Position System (GPS) Radio Occultation (RO) (COSMIC GPS-RO)) we show that the ATAL can exist up to the layer of maximum stability (LmaxS), located a few kilometers above the tropopause, determined using the square of Brunt Väisäla frequency. These in-situ observations over Indian stations collected during the ISRO-NASA Balloon Measurement Campaigns of the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (BATAL) show that the ATAL top can reach up to ∼442 K potential temperature level over the Indian region. The LmaxS delineated from COSMIC GPSRO observations over the Asian Summer Monsoon Anticyclone (ASMA) region indicates that the top of ATAL can reach up to 454 K potential temperature level, which is lower than the earlier Lagrangian transport model predicted 460 K.

However, some regions of the EAIS have lost mass over recent decades, prompting the need to re-evaluate its sensitivity to climate change. Here we review the EAIS’s response to past warm periods, synthesise current observations of change, and evaluate future projections. Some marine-based catchments that underwent significant mass loss during past warm periods are currently losing mass, but most projections indicate increased accumulation across the EAIS over the 21st Century, keeping the ice sheet broadly in balance. Beyond 2100, high emissions scenarios generate increased ice discharge and potentially several metres of sea-level rise within just a few centuries, but substantial mass loss could be averted if the Paris Agreement to limit warming below 2°C is satisfied."

Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb. In some case the ECP and all-electron (AE) results are in good
agreement, while in others there are significant difference. The difference are much larger when
the segmented basis set is used in conjunction with the ECP than when the atomic natural orbital (ANO) basis set is used. The study of the atoms suggests that problems for lanthanide containing molecules are associated with poor atomic excitation energies in the ECP treatment and even using the ANO basis set does not completely solve the problem. We note that the problem appears to be more severe for density functional approaches than for traditional correlation methods. We suggest that additional studies and new effective core potentials may be required for the Lanthanide atoms."

Among these is the vicarious calibration coefficient (g) of the “long” near infrared band (NIRL) used for atmospheric correction. For this band, the prelaunch calibration has always been deemed sufficient [thus g(NIRL) = 1.00] as long as other bands are vicariously calibrated. Recent research, however, suggests that Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS)/Aqua RRS time series is quite sensitive to g(NIRL) (and associated vicarious gains in other bands). In this work, we assessed the sensitivity of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite (VIIRS/SNPP) RRS to NIRL calibration and compared our results to previous MODIS/Aqua and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor onboard OrbView2 (SeaWiFS)/OrbView2 analysis. In doing so, we note that g(NIRL) sensitivities of mission-averaged RRS time series are lower for VIIRS and Sea-WiFS, relative to MODIS. At the scale of monthly climatologies (MCs), however, all sensors show prominent g(NIRL) sensitivity
with that of SeaWiFS being the most substantial. These findings informed simulation analyses, whereby we identified signal-tonoise
ratio (SNR) and radiant path geometry, as well as their interaction, as having notable impacts on g(NIRL) sensitivity. As such, g(NIRL) sensitivity is a necessary consideration for reflectance uncertainty budgets, especially for sensors with higher NIR SNR or particular prevailing radiant path geometries. Given the geometry components embedded within g(NIRL) sensitivity, such studies should be coupled with cross-sensor intercalibrations [e.g., using simultaneous same view (SSV) measurements] toward minimizing NIRL errors between satellite instruments, but such efforts will not completely remediate remaining cross-sensor biases in RRS.

While developed for a specific project, these data are publicly available and useful for other applications that require hydrologic estimates of the water and energy balance. These two data streams are unique because of their suitability for routine monitoring, as well as for being a historical record for computing relative indicators of water availability. The global stream is available at ∼ 1-month latency, and monthly average outputs are on a 10 km grid from 1982–present. The second data stream, Central Asia (21–56°N, 30–100°E), at ∼ 1 d latency, provides daily average outputs on a 1 km grid from 2000–present. This paper describes the configuration of the two FLDAS data streams, background on the software modeling framework, selected meteorological inputs and parameters, and results from previous evaluation studies. We also provide additional analysis of precipitation and snow cover over Afghanistan. We conclude with an example of how these data are used in integrated food security analysis.

While the first proposal was for an asteroid, for a while some theories invoked a cometary impactor to explain perceived periodicities in mass extinctions.  Such models have long been disfavored by the mass of Ir in the layer, inferred to be2.0−2.8×1011g.  The size of Chicxulub crater leads to an estimated asteroid impactor diameter,D≈10 km. Comets typically impact at higher speeds, reducing the impactor mass for the same impact energy. Although it is increasingly recognized that a continuum exists between comets and asteroids, ’comets’ are considered to be more ice-rich (estimates for67P/ Churyumov-Gerasimenko are about 20%;), implying lower Ir contents per impactor mass. A carbonaceous chondrite-like asteroid of the appropriate size would likely deliver≈2.3×1011gof Ir, in the center of the estimated mass range of the global Ir layer; but a comet would only deliver∼0.1×1011g, because it would be less massive. Although these conclusions are long standing, Siraj & Loeb have recently argued anew in favor of a comet over an asteroid, based on dynamical and geochemical evidence. Here we demonstrate that their arguments are based on misinterpretations of the literature, and that an asteroid is in fact still highly favored over a comet."

A critical piece of these future missions is the Lunar Transport Vehicle (LTV), a transportation device to be used on the lunar surface. A vehicular method of transportation will allow for longer duration missions with increased capabilities to conduct research and transport soil, geological samples, or other materials of interest.

Multiple missions to the lunar surface throughout the Apollo program also deployed the use of a lunar vehicle, known as the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). The LRV was used during three of the six Apollo missions that successfully landed humans on the moon. Unfortunately, the LRV did not have any onboard instrumentation, and a large portion of the lunar performance evaluation relied on photographic documentation and crew reports. Therefore, we do not know the actual accelerations and vibrations experienced by the crew when driving on the lunar surface.

The objective of this document is to provide occupant protection guidance when designing the LTV. Acceleration, vibration, and jerk metrics imparted by the vehicle relative to the occupant shall not exceed those listed in this document. At the time of writing of these requirements, much of the LTV design is unknown. This document details requirements based on multiple possible restraint configurations and crew orientations."

from a model of the X-59 Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator aircraft. A 1.62%-scale model of the
aircraft in the C612A configuration was fabricated for the wind tunnel test, which took place in
the NASA Glenn 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel in September and October 2021.

The model had provisions for two different mounting options: a swept blade strut that
attached at the top of model ahead of the inlet, and rear-entry sting that was made as one piece
with a dummy nacelle, and which had a 2”-long cylindrical segment aft of the nozzle exit before
tapering up in size. The blade strut allowed for a clean aft end of the model for evaluation of the
shocks from that region, while the sting avoided the significant distortions of the flow and shocks
from the blade strut along the top of the model. Both the sting and the strut had adapters that
attached to a force balance. The model had alternate parts for ±0.5° deflections of the flaps,
ailerons, and stabilator, and ±1° deflections of the T-tail horizontal surface.

Off-body static pressure measurements of the flow field below the model were made by use
of a pressure rail which had 420 orifices along its tip. The model was positioned at various
heights from the rail by vertical movement of the wind tunnel strut, and at various longitudinal
stations relative to the rail by means of a linear actuator mounted between the tunnel strut and
the balance. The longitudinal positioning allowed multiple pressure signatures to be obtained
along different portions of the rail. These signatures were aligned by accounting for the model
longitudinal movement and then averaged to take out the effects of tunnel flow distortions and
the interference of the rail flow field and shocks on the model pressure signatures. The test was
run at approximate Mach numbers of 1.36, 1.4, and 1.47, and the model was set at various
angles of attack and roll relative to the rail.

Plots of the model signatures for all the variations of Mach number, model angles, control
deflections, and height relative to the rail are provided throughout the report. Repeatability was
generally very good and gave confidence in the quality of the measurements. The signatures
measured at various heights from the rail provided insight into the aging of the model shocks as
they propagated from 1.2 to 3 body lengths from the model. Off-track signatures up to 45° from
centerline obtained by rolling the model gave indications of the shock flow fields across the
width of the sonic boom carpet. The deflections of the various control surfaces allowed
assessment of the boom sensitivity to the control surface movements."

This world’s second largest forest has distinct meteorological characteristics, and its ecosystem is controlled by complex interactions between many climatic phenomena that act across scales(Fig. 1). Due to its location, the Congo rainforest also contributes to processes responsible for interhemispheric climatic communications in Africa. At the larger scale, the basin regulates the global tropical circulation by serving as one of the world’s most convectively active regions. Therefore, the Congo Basin offers a unique natural laboratory for climate science explorations and the implications for people and ecosystems.

In response to this designation, NASA initiated several multi-center studies, with the goal of recommending observing system architectures for each DO for implementation within this decade. This paper provides an overview of the Mass Change Designated Observable (MCDO) Study along with key findings. The study process included: (a) generation of a Science and Applications Traceability Matrix (SATM) that maps required measurement parameters to the DS Science and Applications Objectives; (b) identification of three architecture classes relevant for measuring mass change: Precise Orbit Determination (POD), Satellite-Satellite-Tracking (SST) and Gravity Gradiometry (GG), along with variants within each architecture class; and (c) creation of a Value Framework process that considers science value, cost, risk, schedule, and partnership opportunities, to identify and recommend high value observing systems for further in-depth study. The study team recommended the implementation of an SST architecture, and identified variants that simultaneously (a) satisfy the baseline measurement parameters of the SATM; (b) maximize the probability of providing overlap with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission currently in operation, accelerating science return from both missions; and (c) provide a pathway towards substantial improvements in resolution and accuracy of mass change data products relative to the program of record."

Young, high-matrix permeability eogenetic karst aquifers may have significantly higher matrix storage than older, lower matrix permeability counterparts. In vulnerable and water-limited karst regions, the timescales of storage may be important for seasonal and sub-seasonal water resource management. We create a framework to quantify storage dynamics in karst aquifers using high-resolution precipitation and groundwater levels from the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer in the US territory of Guam. We estimate recharge using the Water Table Fluctuation method, and then develop transfer functions between precipitation and recharge to quantify storage and release of water from the vadose zone. The transfer functions are partitioned into different flow pathways including conduit, conduit/matrix, and slowly draining matrix. Probability distributions are fit to each pathway to determine the average travel times of infiltrated waters. The results show that aquifer recharge through secondary porosity features typically occurs within a few hours of a rainfall event, but this rapid recharge accounts for only 12%–28% of total recharge. The majority of aquifer recharge (>70%) occurs within a month of a contributing storm event. An additional 10% of recharge, on average, took longer than a month to reach the water table. The framework established can help improve the hydrological modeling and freshwater management for karst aquifers."

A detection method is developed to quantify characteristics of the checkerboard signal by cataloguing all possible configurations of the eight adjacent neighbors for each cell on the model's cubed sphere grid using daily mean data. The checkerboard pattern is only found in cloud-related quantities, such as precipitation and liquid water path. Instances of pure and partial checkerboard are found to occur more often in E3SMv2 and E3SM-MMF when compared to satellite data regridded to the model grid. Continuous periods of partial checkerboard state are found to be more persistent in both models compared to satellite data, with E3SM-MMF exhibiting more persistence than E3SMv2. The checkerboard signal in E3SMv2 is found to be a direct consequence of the recently added deep convective trigger condition based on dynamically generated CAPE (DCAPE). In E3SM-MMF the checkerboard signal is found to be associated with the “trapping” of cloud-scale fluctuations within the embedded cloud-resolving model. Solutions to remedy this issue are discussed."

This occurs when a reported value differs from a participant’s true experience. The two topics examined in this paper are 1) recall bias: how consistently participants recall their annoyance to sonic thump events and 2) survey satisficing: whether participants opt for early survey termination if the option is available. Data from QSF18 were examined for evidence of recall bias and survey satisficing via inconsistencies between single event and daily summary survey reports. In terms of recall bias, when only one single event survey and daily summary survey were submitted by a participant on a particular day, both the single event and daily summary annoyance ratings match in the majority of instances (167 of 186).  In terms of survey satisficing, there were fewer questions in the daily summary survey if the participant reported not hearing any sonic thumps during the day.  Nevertheless, the instances of participants inconsistently reporting boom audibility between the single event and daily summary survey are relatively few (66 of 767). Therefore, the results of this study provide evidence to rule out recall bias and satisficing as sources of error in the QSF18 study."

AC allows inference of parameters such as spectrally resolved remote sensing reflectance (R(rs)(λ); sr^(-1) at the ocean surface from the top-of-atmosphere reflectance. Often, the uncertainty of this process is not fully explored. Bayesian inference techniques provide a simultaneous AC and uncertainty assessment via a full posterior distribution of the relevant variables, given the prior distribution of those variables and the radiative transfer (RT) likelihood function. Given uncertainties in the algorithm inputs, the Bayesian framework enables better constraints on the AC process by using the complete spectral information compared to traditional approaches that use only a subset of bands for AC. This paper investigates a Bayesian inference research method (Optimal Estimation, OE) for ocean color AC by simultaneously retrieving atmospheric and ocean properties using all visible and near-infrared spectral bands. The OE algorithm analytically approximates the posterior distribution of parameters based on normality assumptions and provides a potentially viable operational algorithm with a reduced computational expense. We developed a Neural Network (NN) RT forward model look-up-table-based emulator to increase algorithm efficiency further and thus speed up the likelihood computations. We then applied the OE algorithm to synthetic data and observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua spacecraft. We compared the R(rs)(λ) retrieval and its uncertainty estimates from the OE method with in-situ validation data from the SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) and Aerosol Robotic Network Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) datasets. The OE algorithm improved R(rs)(λ) estimates relative to the NASA standard operational algorithm by improving all statistical metrics at 443, 555, and 667 nm. Unphysical negative R(rs)(λ), which often appear in complex water conditions, was reduced by a factor of 3. The OE-derived pixel-level R(rs)(λ) uncertainty estimates were also assessed relative to in-situ data and were shown to have skill."

OCI has two hyperspectral CCD sensors covering 340nm to 885nm and 9 SWIR (Short Wave IR) bands from 940nm to 2260nm. SWIR bands have nominal 1km ground pixel size and CCD bands have native 1/8 km ground pixel size in diagnostic mode that will be aggregated into 1km pixels to improve SNR and meet the data rate constraints. OCI has a rotating telescope that is synchronized to the readout of the CCD and SWIR detectors. Full pre-launch system level testing for the OCI ETU (Engineering Test Unit) was completed in June 2021.With time-delayed scan mode, a  sub-pixel  level  time-delay step is applied to the  detector readout.  This sub-pixel  level time-delay step causes a sub-pixel level shift in the start of the data collection. After collecting time-delay step scans with different step sizes, a scan profile with sub-pixel resolution can be constructed. 1/8 and 1/4 of CCD pixel resolutions were achieved using this mode. In this paper, the OCI time-delayed scan mode will be described as well as how it was used to calculate  OCI’s  high  spatial  resolution  PSF  (Point  Spread  Function), IFOV  (instantaneous  Field  of  View),  MTF (Modulation Transfer Function), and BBR (Band to Band Registration)."

The sustained calibration and characterization activities undertaken by the MODIS Characterization Support Team have resulted in several upgrades to the L1B algorithms in order to maintain accurate calibration in the data products. In this paper, we present an overview of the L1B algorithm designated as Collection 7.  Various algorithm enhancements both in the reflective bands and thermal bands characterization, are currently under science testing and evaluation. Once applied in data processing (projected in early 2023), they are expected to manifest in improved science products, both in terms of radiometric accuracy and long-term stability."

Furthermore, activity from local oil fields generated nitrogen dioxide (NO2) plumes that spread over the parks and augmented the effects of the drought. NO2 is a precursor for tropospheric ozone (O3) which is known to have adverse effects on vegetation and ecosystems at large. These new climate dynamics prompted the National Park Service (NPS) to collaborate with NASA DEVELOP to assess the impact on vegetation within the parks. We used NASA Earth observations including Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals (GPM IMERG) to assess vegetation health, water stress, and precipitation in the affected parks. After creating a homogeneous reference area in the Sierra Diablo Mountains, the team visualized vegetation health through a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series map from 2010-2021. This did not show strong evidence that the NO2 plume is causing vegetation decline. Following this, we created a water stress map with a Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) time series map from 2010-2021, which revealed a pattern of increasing water stress. We also confirmed that precipitation in the region decreased over the span of 2010-2021. These observations and findings will allow the NPS Intermountain Region to more effectively plan for the preservation and maintenance of vegetation health within the parks."

Here we present spectral evidence that Grosvenor Mountains (GRO) 95577, a CR1, is a better analogue for Bennu's bulk surface mineralogy. CR-like parent bodies are targets of interest because they contain some of the most pristine materials from the solar nebula and can contain substantial amounts of H2O and OH− in addition to exotic organics. Unfortunately, terrestrial weathering makes constraining their indigenous mineralogy and organics challenging. Analysis of samples retrieved directly from an asteroid would help us disentangle the effects of terrestrial weathering and asteroidal aqueous alteration and hence whether some of the exotic organics and large populations of presolar grains were affected by terrestrial processes in meteorites. If Bennu is comprised of CR1(−like) material, in whole or in part, the OSIRIS–REx returned sample represents a tremendous opportunity to explore in depth what is currently a unique material among carbonaceous chondrites."

The MSR Campaign, as currently designed, presents an important opportunity to return serendipitous, airfall dust. The tubes containing samples collected by the Perseverance rover would be placed in cache depots on the martian surface perhaps as early as 2023–24 for recovery by a subsequent mission no earlier than 2028–29, and possibly as late as 2030–31. Thus, the sample tube surfaces could passively collect dust for multiple years. This dust is deemed to be exceptionally valuable as it would inform our knowledge and understanding of Mars' global mineralogy, surface processes, surface-atmosphere interactions, and atmospheric circulation. Preliminary calculations suggest that the total mass of such dust on a full set of tubes could be as much as 100 mg and, therefore, sufficient for many types of laboratory analyses. Two planning steps would optimize our ability to take advantage of this opportunity: (1) the dust-covered sample tubes should be loaded into the Orbiting Sample container (OS) with minimal cleaning and (2) the capability to recover this dust early in the workflow within an MSR Sample Receiving Facility (SRF) would need to be established. A further opportunity to advance dust/atmospheric science using MSR, depending upon the design of the MSR Campaign elements, may lie with direct sampling and the return of airborne dust."

Compressive sensing (CS) is a simultaneous data acquisition and compression technique, which can greatly reduce on-board resources required for space flight data storage and ground transmission. We simulate microlensing parallax observations using a space observatory constellation, based on CS detectors. Our results show that average CS error is less than 0.5% using 25% Nyquist rate samples. The error at peak magnification time is significantly lower than the error for distinguishing any two microlensing parallax curves at their peak magnification. Thus, CS is an enabling technology for detecting microlensing parallax, without causing any loss in detection accuracy."

Tinaja flooding and drying cycles, known as hydroperiods, vary based on meteorologic and climatologic conditions; however, a lack of extensive research relating climatic impacts to tinajas puts these critical ecosystems further at risk. The National Park Service (NPS) and the University of Arizona monitor the physical and ecological condition of tinajas in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument (OPCNM), AZ, using resource-intensive strategies: in situ trail cameras and direct measurements. To aid monitoring efforts, the NASA DEVELOP team aimed to incorporate remote sensing into NPS strategies by analyzing spatiotemporal climate data and tinaja hydroperiods in OPCNM between 1979–2022. Using Aqua and Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS), University of Idaho Gridded Surface Meteorological Dataset (gridMET), and OpenET data, the team generated climatology maps and time series for OPCNM. The team compared these data to daily in situ hydroperiod observations from the University of Arizona between 2019–2022. Climate maps and time series showed increases in temperature and solar radiation (p<0.05), while analyses of in situ data showed correlations of hydroperiods with precipitation and evapotranspiration. End products identified high-risk tinajas and demonstrated that Earth observations can successfully be correlated with in situ hydroperiod observations. These results will support NPS efforts to prioritize water resource management and inform protocols driving the conservation of tinajas in OPCNM."

We observed that the eruption induced strong GWs in the mesosphere. Detailed analysis shows that there were strong GWs with amplitudes greater than 30 K (twice the usual GWs) on January 15. These GWs have dominant vertical wavelengths of 13.9–25.5 km and horizontal speeds of 44–81 ms(exp −1), and they have intrinsic periods (momentum flux per unit mass) of ∼2–5 hr (4–320 m(exp 2)s(exp −2)). The strong but slow GWs observed here are opposite to the fast GWs observed at different atmospheric layers after the Tonga volcano eruption, and are stronger than the GWs associated with other volcanic eruption and extreme weather events. Such that one can get a more comprehensive picture on GWs excited by a powerful source."

Examples of science autonomy include onboard data analysis and subsequent instrument optimization, data prioritization (for transmission), and real-time decision-making based on data analysis. Similar advances could be made to develop streamlined data processing software for rapid ground-based analyses. Here we discuss several ways machine learning and autonomy could be used for astrobiology missions, including landing site selection, prioritization and targeting of samples, classification of “features” (e.g., proposed biosignatures) and novelties (uncharacterized, “new” features, which may be of most interest to agnostic astrobiological investigations), and data transmission."

The uneven distribution of heat risk in Wichita across socioeconomic status is an environmental justice issue. We worked with the City of Wichita to map heat exposure, tree canopy, and heat risk in order to support the City's climate resilience initiatives. To visualize heat exposure, we quantified and mapped average summer heat from 2013–2021 using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) night-time LST. To understand tree canopy cover gaps, we created a tree canopy map using 2021 PlanetScope imagery, which identified 20% more trees than the US Geological Survey’s (USGS) National Land Cover Database (NLCD) tree canopy coverage estimates for Wichita. To characterize high risk areas, we used socioeconomic census data and existing social vulnerability indices, highlighting populations that were exposed and vulnerable to extreme heat. The spatial analyses demonstrated that heat exposure is concentrated in the city center and southwest Wichita, areas that are also low in tree canopy coverage. The three census block groups and 17 census tracts with the highest heat risk primarily circle the city center, in areas home to more socially vulnerable populations and near enough to the dense urban center to feel significant urban heat island effects."

On the Use and Significance of the Term “Polar Vortex”,"Mainstream and popular science media are rife with misunderstandings about what a “polar vortex” is. The term most aptly describes the stratospheric polar vortex, a single feature dominating the cool-season circulation from ∼15–50 km. Regional jet stream variations dominate the tropospheric circulation, which is not well-described as a polar vortex; indeed, there is no single consistent definition of a tropospheric polar vortex in the literature. Stratospheric polar vortex disturbances profoundly influence extreme weather events, including cold air outbreaks (CAOs). How the stratospheric polar vortex affects tropospheric jets, whose local excursions drive CAOs, is not fully understood. Public facing parts of publications describing research on this topic are not always clear about how the “polar vortex” is defined; greater clarity could improve communications both within the community and with non-specialist audiences."

It is also possible with such a system to retrieve sea surface salinity (SSS), which is important for understanding the impact of climate change on ocean circulation at high latitude. In contemporary sensors for retrieving SSS, such as on Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), sea surface temperature (SST), another parameter important for understanding ocean circulation and necessary in the retrieval of salinity, is treated as an ancillary parameter obtained from an independent source. However, both SSS and SST have peaks in sensitivity below 1 GHz; and it has been shown that measurements at multiple frequencies in this portion of the spectrum can take advantage of this peak in sensitivity to improve the accuracy of the retrieval of SSS. In this manuscript, it will be shown that there is also the potential to retrieve SST and, in cold water, the possibility for improved accuracy over existing retrievals."

A NASA Standard NDE flaw size is considered to be conservative such that most inspectors, trained and certified in the specific method, are expected to provide the required 90/95 probability of detection (POD) for that flaw size. As such, individual certified inspectors are not required to perform POD demonstration testing to be allowed to inspect fracture-critical hardware for that specific method."

and apply it to compute a flow involving pressure gradients, surface curvature and separation, for which data from a direct numerical simulation are available for comparison. The model, inspired by the triple model idea of Bardina et al. (“Improved Turbulence Models Based on Large Eddy Simulation of Homogeneous, Incompressible, Turbulent Flows,” Report No. TF-19, Thermosciences Division, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, 1983), includes a Galilean-invariant term called the modified Leonard stress tensor, and two nonlinear terms comprised of the products of the strain-rate and rotation-rate tensors for an improved representation of the subgrid-scale dissipation, backscatter and anisotropy effects. The model does not employ any ad hoc averaging or clipping procedures, and does not require the specification of a characteristic length scale; hence, it naturally avoids the ambiguities associated with defining a proper length scale for anisotropic grids. Results from the wall-resolved LES of flow past a Gaussian bump using the new model demonstrate improved prediction of skin-friction,
flow separation, mean flow profiles and turbulent quantities when compared to implicit LES as well as explicit LES using the Vreman SGS model on the same grid."

There are a multitude of complexities involved in how space environment interacts with different space hardware/electronics. Measurements of such impacts, however, have been lacking. Therefore, we recommend developing and/or procuring low-cost, low-power consumption, and compact sensor suites (mainly for space weather and impact purposes) and flying them on all future NASA (and, more generally, U.S) missions in order to measure and quantify space weather impacts, in addition to the main instrumentation."

Flare emission is the first component of a SEE to impact the Earth’s ionosphere which can set the stage for the later effects of the space weather event. Magnetic reconnection drives SEEs by restructuring the solar coronalmagnetic field, liberating a tremendous amount of energy which is partitioned into various physical manifestations: particle acceleration,mass and magnetic-field eruption, atmospheric heating, and the subsequent emission of radiation as solar flares. In this white paper we discuss the observational and theoretical advances required in order to make substantial progress in understanding the physical processes acting during the impulsive phase of a flare. That is, the initial rapid and intense period in which a tremendous amount of energy is released over the span of several minutes, resulting in the dramatic broadband increase to the solar radiative output. A second white paper by us covers the flare’s gradual phase, that is the decay phase where processes occur over longer timescales."

In recent years, interest in space weather predictions has expanded to include impacts at other planets beyond Earth as well as spacecraft scattered throughout the heliosphere. In this sense, the scope of space weather science now encompasses the whole heliospheric system, and multipoint measurements of solar transients can provide useful insights and validations for prediction models. In this work, we aim to analyze the whole inner heliospheric context between two eruptive flares that took place in late 2020, that is, the M4.4 flare of 29 November and the C7.4 flare of 7 December. This period is especially interesting because the STEREO-A spacecraft was located ∼60° east of the Sun–Earth line, giving us the opportunity to test the capabilities of “predictions at 360°” using remote-sensing observations from the Lagrange L1 and L5 points as input. We simulate the CMEs that were ejected during our period of interest and the SEPs accelerated by their shocks using the WSA–Enlil–SEPMOD modeling chain and four sets of input parameters, forming a “mini-ensemble.” We validate our results using in situ observations at six locations, including Earth and Mars. We find that, despite some limitations arising from the models' architecture and assumptions, CMEs and shock-accelerated SEPs can be reasonably studied and forecast in real time at least out to several tens of degrees away from the eruption site using the prediction tools employed here."

These mangroves are imperative for coastline stabilization, habitat provision for native species, and water quality management. Our partner, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Office of Resilience and Coastal Protection is tasked with monitoring and conserving the Charlotte Harbor, Estero Bay, Rookery Bay, and Pinellas County Aquatic Preserves. We developed the Growth, Resilience, and Optical Vegetation Evaluator (GROVE) Google Earth Engine toolset for partners to determine mangrove forest extent through time, analyze mangrove forest health, and collect several water quality parameters within the preserves from January 2002–August 2022. The toolset provides easily accessible data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2), and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Using training datasets of known mangrove forest locations, we also established a machine learning approach to create mangrove extent maps. Maps from all four preserves indicated migration of mangrove forests inland as the greatest areas of change were transitional zones. Additionally, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI), and chlorophyll-a maps were generated for the partners. This project provides decision makers with a useful tool for understanding temporal changes in Florida’s aquatic preserves, identifying areas of ecological stress, and providing actionable data to make informed plans for mangrove preservation."

Together with observational analysis, they constitute a comprehensive scientific program in heliophysics. As observations and data analysis become increasingly detailed, it is critical that theory and modeling develop more quantitative predictions and iterate with observations. Advanced theory and modeling can inspire and greatly improve the design of new instruments and increase their chance of success. In addition, in order to build physics based space weather forecast models, it is important to keep developing and testing new theories, and maintaining constant communications with theory and modeling. Maintaining a sustainable effort in theory and modeling is critically important to heliophysics. We recommend that all funding agencies join forces and consider expanding current and creating new theory and modeling programs–especially, 1. NASA should restore the HTMS program to its original support level to meet the critical needs of heliophysics science; 2. a Strategic Research Model program needs to be created to support model development for next-generation basic research codes; 3. new programs must be created for addressing mission-critical theory and modeling needs; and 4. enhanced programs are urgently required for training the next generation of theorists and modelers."

A previous study of ozone profiles retrieved exclusively from TROPOMI UV spectra showed that the vertical resolution in the troposphere is clearly limited (Mettig et al., 2021). The vertical resolution and the vertical extent of the ozone profiles is improved by combining both wavelength ranges compared to retrievals limited to UV or IR spectral data only. The combined retrieval particularly improves the accuracy of the retrieved tropospheric ozone and to a lesser degree stratospheric ozone up to 30 km. An increase in the degrees of freedom (DOF) by 1 DOF was found in the UV + IR retrieval compared to the UV-only retrieval. Compared to previous publications, which investigated combinations of UV and IR observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (OMI and TES) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment version 2 and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (GOME-2 and IASI) pairs, the degree of freedom is lower, which is attributed to the reduced spectral resolution of CrIS compared to TES or IASI. Tropospheric lidar and ozonesondes were used to validate the ozone profiles and tropospheric ozone content (TOC). In their comparison with tropospheric lidars, both ozone profiles and TOCs show smaller biases for the retrieved data from the combined UV + IR observation than from the UV observations alone. For the ozone profiles below 10 km, the mean differences are around ±10 % and the mean TOC varies around ±3 DU. We show that TOCs from the combined retrieval agree better with ozonesonde results at northern latitudes than the UV-only and IR-only retrievals and also have lower scatter. In the tropics, the IR-only retrieval shows the best agrement with TOCs derived from ozonesondes. While in general the TOCs show good agreement with ozonesonde data, the profiles have a positive bias of around 30 % between 10 and 15 km. The reason is probably a positive stratospheric bias from the IR retrieval. The comparison of the UV + IR and UV ozone profiles up to 30 km with the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) demonstrates the improvement of the UV + IR profile in the stratosphere above 18 km. In comparison to the UV-only approach the retrieval shows improvements of up to 10 % depending on latitude but can also show worse results in some regions and latitudes."

To this end, we formulate a variational principle that seeks to minimize the distance between the time derivative of the reduced approximation and sensitivity dynamics. The first order optimality condition of the variational principle leads to a system of closed form evolution equations for an orthonormal basis and corresponding sensitivity coefficients. This approach allows for the computation of sensitivities with respect to a large number of parameters in an accurate and tractable manner by extracting correlations between different sensitivities on the fly. The presented method requires solving forward evolution equations, sidestepping the restrictions imposed by the forward/backward workflow of adjoint sensitivities. For example, the presented method, unlike the adjoint equation, does not impose any input/output load and can be used in applications in which real-time sensitivities are of interest. We demonstrate the utility of the method for three test cases: (1) computing sensitivity with respect to model parameters in the Rössler system, (2) computing sensitivity with respect to an infinite-dimensional forcing parameter in the chaotic Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and (3) computing sensitivity with respect to reaction parameters for species transport in a turbulent reacting flow."

We first evaluate GEOS-Chem with in-situ airborne measurements during Atmospheric Tomography Mission 1 (ATom-1) aircraft campaign. We show reasonable agreement between observed and modeled HCHO, isoprene, monoterpenes and the sum of methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein (MVK+MACR) in continental boundary layer. In particular, HCHO profiles show spatial homogeneity in Alaska, suggesting a minor contribution of biogenic emissions to HCHO VCD. We further examine the TROPOMI HCHO product in Alaska summer, reprocessed by GEOS-Chem model output for a priori profiles and shape factors. For the year with low wildfire activity (e.g.,2018), we find that HCHO VCDs are largely dominated by background HCHO (58-71%), with minor contributions from wildfires (20-32%) and biogenic VOC emissions (8-10%). For the year with intense wildfires (e.g.,2019), summertime HCHO VCD is dominated by wildfire emissions (50-72%), with minor contributions from background (22-41%) and biogenic VOCs (6-10%). In particular, the model indicates a major contribution of wildfires from direct emissions of HCHO, instead of secondary production of HCHO from oxidation of larger VOCs. We find that the column contributed by biogenic VOC is often small and below the TROPOMI detection limit, in part due to the slow HCHO production from isoprene oxidation under low NOx conditions. This work highlights challenges for quantifying HCHO and its precursors in remote pristine regions."

Exhaustive evaluations on model representation of aerosol distributions and properties are fundamental to assess health and climate impacts of BBA. Here we conducted a comprehensive comparison of Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) project model simulations with satellite observations. A total of 59 runs by 18 models from three AeroCom Phase-III experiments (i.e., biomass burning emissions, CTRL16, and CTRL19) and 14 satellite products of aerosols were used in the study. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm was investigated during the fire season over three key fire regions reflecting different fire dynamics (i.e., deforestation-dominated Amazon, Southern Hemisphere Africa where savannas are the key source of emissions, and boreal forest burning in boreal North America). The 14 satellite products were first evaluated against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations, with large uncertainties found. But these uncertainties had small impacts on the model evaluation that was dominated by modeling bias. Through a comparison with Polarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectances measurements with the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties algorithm (POLDER-GRASP), we found that the modeled AOD values were biased by −93 % to 152 %, with most models showing significant underestimations even for the state-of-the-art aerosol modeling techniques (i.e., CTRL19). By scaling up BBA emissions, the negative biases in modeled AOD were significantly mitigated, although it yielded only negligible improvements in the correlation between models and observations, and the spatial and temporal variations in AOD biases did not change much. For models in CTRL16 and CTRL19, the large diversity in modeled AOD was in almost equal measures caused by diversity in emissions, lifetime, and the mass extinction coefficient (MEC). We found that in the AeroCom ensemble, BBA lifetime correlated significantly with particle deposition (as expected) and in turn correlated strongly with precipitation. Additional analysis based on Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol profiles suggested that the altitude of the aerosol layer in the current models was generally too low, which also contributed to the bias in modeled lifetime. Modeled MECs exhibited significant correlations with the Ångström exponent (AE, an indicator of particle size). Comparisons with the POLDER-GRASP-observed AE suggested that the models tended to overestimate the AE (underestimated particle size), indicating a possible underestimation of MECs in models. The hygroscopic growth in most models generally agreed with observations and might not explain the overall underestimation of modeled AOD. Our results imply that current global models contain biases in important aerosol processes for BBA (e.g., emissions, removal, and optical properties) that remain to be addressed in future research."

Smoke effects on the transition between overcast stratocumulus and scattered cumulus clouds are investigated along a Lagrangian (air-mass-following) trajectory in regional climate and large eddy simulation models. Results are compared with observations from three recent field campaigns that took place in August 2017: ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES), CLouds and Aerosol Radiative Impacts and Forcing: Year 2017 (CLARIFY), and Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds (LASIC). The case study is set up around the joint ORACLES–CLARIFY flight that took place near Ascension Island on 18 August 2017. Smoke sampled upstream on an ORACLES flight on 15 August 2017 likely entrained into the marine boundary layer later sampled during the joint flight.

The case is first simulated with the WRF-CAM5 regional climate model in three distinct setups: (1) FireOn, in which smoke emissions and any resulting smoke–cloud–radiation interactions are included; (2) FireOff, in which no smoke emissions are included; (3) RadOff, in which smoke emissions and their microphysical effects are included but aerosol does not interact directly with radiation. Over the course of the Lagrangian trajectory, differences in free tropospheric thermodynamic properties between FireOn and FireOff are nearly identical to those between FireOn and RadOff, showing that aerosol–radiation interactions are primarily responsible for the free tropospheric effects. These effects are non-intuitive: in addition to the expected heating within the core of the smoke plume, there is also a “banding” effect of cooler temperature (∼1–2 K) and greatly enhanced moisture (>2 g kg−1) at the plume top. This banding effect is caused by a vertical displacement of the former continental boundary layer in the free troposphere in the FireOn simulation resulting from anomalous diabatic heating due to smoke absorption of sunlight that manifests primarily as a few hundred meters per day reduction in large-scale subsidence over the ocean.

A large eddy simulation (LES) is then forced with free tropospheric fields taken from the outputs for the WRF-CAM5 FireOn and FireOff runs. Cases are run by selectively perturbing one variable (e.g., aerosol number concentration, temperature, moisture, vertical velocity) at a time to better understand the contributions from different indirect (microphysical), “large-scale” semi-direct (above-cloud thermodynamic and subsidence changes), and “local” semi-direct (below-cloud smoke absorption) effects. Despite a more than 5-fold increase in cloud droplet number concentration when including smoke aerosol concentrations, minimal differences in cloud fraction evolution are simulated by the LES when comparing the base case with a perturbed aerosol case with identical thermodynamic and dynamic forcings. A factor of 2 decrease in background free tropospheric aerosol concentrations from the FireOff simulation shifts the cloud evolution from a classical entrainment-driven “deepening–warming” transition to trade cumulus to a precipitation-driven “drizzle-depletion” transition to open cells, however. The thermodynamic and dynamic changes caused by the WRF-simulated large-scale adjustments to smoke diabatic heating strongly influence cloud evolution in terms of both the rate of deepening (especially for changes in the inversion temperature jump and in subsidence) and in cloud fraction on the final day of the simulation (especially for the moisture “banding” effect). Such large-scale semi-direct effects would not have been possible to simulate using a small-domain LES model alone."

On California’s central coast, where the majority of cool season vegetables are produced in the US, long-term overpumping of irrigation water has reduced groundwater levels and led to environmental degradation. Two evapotranspiration (ET) based irrigation field trials were performed near Salinas CA (USA) to determine if ET-based irrigation scheduling could conserve water while producing romaine lettuce (cv. Sun Valley) of commercially viable yield. Sprinklers were used for seed germination and crop establishment. Four drip irrigation treatments were then imposed using a randomized complete block design with six replications. The CropManage decision support model was used to estimate the full (100%) crop water requirement based mainly on ET replacement. Other treatments included 50% 75% and 150% of the full water requirement. The 100% treatment received 185 mm of water in 2015 and 247 mm in 2016, both of which were well below prior guidance and grower reports. Yields from the 100% and 150% treatments were not significantly different and were similar to industry average, while yields were significantly lower for the 50% and 75% treatments. The 100% treatment had the highest water use efficiency, and the 100% and 150% treatments together had the highest nitrogen recovery efficiency. Irrigation of romaine near the 100% ET replacement level can potentially reduce environmental impacts associated with nitrate leaching and surface runoff."

Focke-Wulf constructed Juan de la Cierva’s C.19 and C.30 Autogiros under license from 1930 until 1937. This led Focke to design the first successful and fully controllable helicopter, the Fw-61. Model tests in his wind tunnel supported the configuration and in 1932 Focke proposed a helicopter project to the ministry with drawings and calculations, which was granted in that same year. Impressed with the success of the Fw-61, the German Air Ministry suggested that Focke establish a new company dedicated to helicopter development and issued him a requirement for an improved design, capable of carrying a 700 kg (1,500 lbs) payload. Focke and Gerd Achgelis (a test pilot) partnered to establish the Focke–Achgelis company in 1938. The Fw-61 became the Fa-61.

Historically, Henrich Focke and his Focke-Achgelis company must surely be considered as the developer of the world’s first successful helicopter. They began development of the Focke Wulf company’s Model Fw-61 helicopter, which had a side-by-side rotor system, in 1932. First flight was achieved on June 26, 1936 with test pilot Ewald Rohlfs at the controls. With the Fw-61’s flight demonstrated success, Professor Focke went on to present three early papers:

        1. Das Trag- und Hubschrauberproblem (Autogyro and Helicopter Problems), November 1937
        2. Forschung und Entwicklung der Drehflügelflugzeuge (Research and Development of Rotating Wing Aircraft), April 1942
        3. Fortschritte des Hubschraubers (Progress of the Helicopter), October 1943

The first paper was also published by the German Museum (Munich) in 1938 and it was translated into English on the order of the Ministry of Aircraft Production by J. Helledoren as R.T.P No. 2128 at the end of 1937. The other two reports, however, appear not to have been translated during or after World War II and thus are made public here – probably for the first time.

Translations of the three Focke papers are provided in this report. A careful translation from German to English of the papers has been made. Many of original photos have been recovered from the German Museum (Munich). In several cases, the original graphs have been redrawn to enhance each paper’s technical value. The editors have added footnotes where appropriate.

The editors consider Focke’s papers to be of such immense technical and historical value that they deserve wide distribution to the rotorcraft industry. Finally, the editors believe that readers of the many technical points Henrich Focke makes about his development program will see that Focke’s program anticipated even today’s best rotorcraft industry efforts."

The statistical audibility prediction (SAP) method relies on the specific loudness, or loudness perceived through the individual auditory filters, for accurate statistical estimation of audibility vs. time.  More recent development has focused on derivation and inclusion of frequency-dependent correction factors in SAP’s model to account for the ability to hear signals below the level of the masking noise.  Audibility prediction vs. time is intuitive since it captures changes in audibility with time as it occurs, which is critical for the study of human response to noise. Concurrently time-frequency prediction of audibility may also provide valuable information about the root cause(s) for audibility useful for the design and operation of sources of noise. Empirical data, gathered under a three-alternative forced-choice (3AFC) test paradigm for low-frequency sound, has been used to examine the accuracy of SAP."

The models produce large ambient electron densities, and the pressure broadening of the hydrogen Balmer series should be readily detected in observations. To accurately interpret the upcoming spectral data of flares with the DKIST, we incorporate nonideal, nonadiabatic line-broadening profiles of hydrogen into the RADYN code. These improvements allow time-dependent predictions for the extreme Balmer line wing enhancements in solar flares. We study two chromospheric condensation models, which cover a range of electron-beam fluxes (1 − 5 × 10^(11) erg s^(−1) cm^(−2)) and ambient electron densities (1 − 60 × 10^(13) cm^(−3)) in the flare chromosphere. Both models produce broadening and redshift variations within 10 s of the onset of beam heating. In the chromospheric condensations, there is enhanced spectral broadening due to large optical depths at Hα, Hβ, and Hγ, while the much lower optical depth of the Balmer series H12−H16 provides a translucent window into the smaller electron densities in the beam-heated layers below the condensation. The wavelength ranges of typical DKIST/ViSP spectra of solar flares will be sufficient to test the predictions of extreme hydrogen wing broadening and accurately constrain large densities in chromospheric condensations."

Standard Test Method for Mechanical Uniaxial Constant Force Thermal Cycling of Shape Memory
Alloys. The ruggedness experiment was designed with eight runs in two replicates, consisting of seven
factors of strain rate (ė), heating and cooling rates (Ṫ(heat) and Ṫ(cool), respectively), upper and lower cycle temperatures (UCT and LCT, respectively), hold time (thold), and minimum load (Fmin) imparted on the samples. The results indicate that the hold time factor had no effect on any result variable. The minimum load factor, alternatively, had the greatest effect on several result variables, with the greatest influence on the strains at martensite start and finish (strain variation ~0.1 percent), and the strains at the upper and lower cycle temperatures (strain variation of 0.14 percent). The UCT was found to have a large effect on the austenite and martensite finish tangent line and data intersect, denoted by Af* and Mf*, by ~17 and 4 °C, respectively. The testing methodology, analysis techniques, and resulting conclusions on the ruggedness of the test methods are presented."

An effective drought monitoring and early warning system is thus critical to support risk mitigation and management by countries in the region. Here we investigate the potential for assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture observations to improve the representation of the overall hydrological and carbon cycles and drought by an advanced land surface model. The results reveal that assimilating soil moisture does not meaningfully improve model representation of the hydrological and biospheric processes for this region, but instead it degrades the simulation of the interannual variation in evapotranspiration (ET) and carbon fluxes, mainly due to model weaknesses in representing prognostic phenology. However, assimilating LAI leads to greater improvement, especially for transpiration and carbon fluxes, by constraining the timing of simulated vegetation growth response to evolving climate conditions. LAI assimilation also helps to correct for the erroneous interaction between the prognostic phenology and irrigation during summertime, effectively reducing a large positive bias in ET and carbon fluxes. Independently assimilating LAI or soil moisture alters the categorization of drought, with the differences being greater for more severe drought categories. We highlight the vegetation representation in response to changing land use and hydroclimate as one of the key processes to be captured for building a successful drought early warning system for the MENA region."

Here, we apply deep learning models on satellite data to produce the first global climatology map of ship-tracks. We show that ship-tracks are at the nexus of cloud physics, maritime shipping, and fuel regulation. Our map captures major shipping lanes while missing others because of background conditions. Ship-track frequency is more than 10 times higher than a previous survey, and its interannual fluctuations reflect variations in cross-ocean trade, shipping activity, and fuel regulations. Fuel regulation can alter both detected frequency and shipping routes due to cost. The 2020 fuel regulation, together with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, reduced ship-track frequency to its lowest level in recent decades across the globe and may have ushered in an era of low frequency. The regulation reduces the aerosol indirect forcing from ship emissions by 46% or between 0.02 and 0.27 W m<sup>−2</sup> given its current estimates."

This work is an update of the trends reported in Weber et al. (2018) using the same datasets up to 2016. Merged datasets used in this study include NASA MOD v8.7 and NOAA Cohesive Data (COH) v8.6, both based on data from the series of Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV), SBUV-2, and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) satellite instruments (1978–present), as well as the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME)-type Total Ozone – Essential Climate Variable (GTO-ECV) and GOME-SCIAMACHY-GOME-2 (GSG) merged datasets (both 1995–present), mainly comprising satellite data from GOME, SCIAMACHY, OMI, GOME-2A, GOME-2B, and TROPOMI. The fifth dataset consists of the annual mean zonal mean data from ground-based measurements collected at the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC).

Trends were determined by applying a multiple linear regression (MLR) to annual mean zonal mean data. The addition of 4 more years consolidated the fact that total ozone is indeed slowly recovering in both hemispheres as a result of phasing out ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) as mandated by the Montreal Protocol. The near-global (60° S–60° N) ODS-related ozone trend of the median of all datasets after 1995 was 0.4 ± 0.2 (2σ) %/decade, which is roughly a third of the decreasing rate of 1.5 ± 0.6 %/decade from 1978 until 1995. The ratio of decline and increase is nearly identical to that of the EESC (equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine or stratospheric halogen) change rates before and after 1995, confirming the success of the Montreal Protocol. The observed total ozone time series are also in very good agreement with the median of 17 chemistry climate models from CCMI-1 (Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative Phase 1) with current ODS and GHG (greenhouse gas) scenarios (REF-C2 scenario).

The positive ODS-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) after 1995 are only obtained with a sufficient number of terms in the MLR accounting properly for dynamical ozone changes (Brewer–Dobson circulation, Arctic Oscillation (AO), and Antarctic Oscillation (AAO)). A standard MLR (limited to solar, Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), volcanic, and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) leads to zero trends, showing that the small positive ODS-related trends have been balanced by negative trend contributions from atmospheric dynamics, resulting in nearly constant total ozone levels since 2000."

Due to this upcoming proliferation of actors and activities at or near the lunar south pole, and due to the potential close proximity of operations, NASA and other operators will face challenges never faced before.

NASA’s Deputy Administrator and Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) tasked the Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy (OTPS) with answering two questions related to the Artemis campaign: (1) what technical and policy considerations should NASA take into account in the selection of lunar landing and operations sites, and (2) what technical and policy
considerations should NASA take into account when implementing tools such as safety zones in order to protect these operations and U.S. interests?

In addition to the challenges inherent in lunar operations, NASA subject-matter experts (SMEs) are concerned about certain challenges to NASA operations that may require policy solutions. The goal of this report is to provide options and recommendations to NASA leadership and program planners so that they can consider policy measures to respond to those challenges.

The Titanian oceans, however, are seas of liquid hydrocarbons, and the rocks on the surface are solid water ice. Like other icy Moons of the outer solar system, beneath the ice crust, Titan also has a subsurface ocean. Rodriguez et al. refer to it as the “world with two oceans”, an organic-rich body with interior-surface-atmosphere interactions that are comparable in complexity to the Earth. [1]
Titan is scientifically fascinating in many ways [2], [3], [4]. The Compass Team will emphasize just one here: Titan is a high priority target for astrobiology [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]. It is a world with a surface and atmosphere rich in the complex organic compounds known as tholins. A detailed understanding of the nature of these complex compounds will require an analysis using a full laboratory on Earth. Because of its value to understanding the organic compounds of the outer solar system which may be the primordial building-blocks of life, return of samples from Titan to laboratories on Earth will be the primary goal of this mission.
While this would give unprecedented science return, returning even a small sample from Titan using conventional technology would be tremendously difficult. Saturn is almost a billion miles from the Earth, about thirteen times farther than Mars. A return mission to Saturn requires such a large total-mission ∆V that, with conventional technology, the mass ratios required are prohibitive. Such a sample return would truly be “mission incredible.” But to date, a sample return mission from so distant a target has been assumed to be, not merely incredible, but mission impossible. The Compass Team has proposed [2] [12] that by manufacturing the propellant for the return to Earth using the resources available on Titan, such a mission becomes possible. The task of this report is to show that it is reasonable with credible space technology."

In this study, we train multi-variate Long-Short Term Memory neural networks to predict magnitude of north-south component of the geomagnetic field (|BN|) at multiple ground magnetometer stations across Alaska provided by the SuperMAG database with a future goal of predicting geomagnetic field disturbances. Each neural network is driven by solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field inputs from the NASA OMNI database spanning from 2000–2015 and is fine tuned for each station to maximize the effectiveness in predicting |BN|. The neural networks are then compared against multivariate linear regression models driven with the same inputs at each station using Heidke skill scores with thresholds at the 50, 75, 85, and 99 percentiles for |BN|. The neural network models show significant increases over the linear regression models for |BN| thresholds. We also calculate the Heidke skill scores for d|BN|/dt by deriving d|BN|/dt from |BN| predictions. However, neural network models do not show clear outperformance compared to the linear regression models. To retain the sign information and thus predict BN instead of |BN|, a secondary so-called polarity model is utilized. The polarity model is run in tandem with the neural networks predicting geomagnetic field in a coupled model approach and results in a high correlation between predicted and observed values for all stations. We find this model a promising starting point for a machine learned geomagnetic field model to be expanded upon through increased output time history and fast turnaround times."

There are redundant measurements of each band for a total of 32 physical channels, which includes optical components through to detection. The relative spectral response (RSR) is measured for each channel, which is needed when accounting for the spectral distribution of sensed radiance. From the RSR, single-value performance metrics are computed including the center wavelength, the full width at half of the maximum (FWHM), and the full width at 1% of the maximum (FW1P). Besides in-band responses, the out-of-band rejection ratio (OOBRR) is also calculated for each of the channels, which is a measure of the sensitivity outside the band of interest.

Its main sources include anthropogenic activities (mostly agriculture) and natural emissions from ocean and soils. However, emission estimates for individual sources are highly variable due to uncertainties in N2O lifetime estimates and partitioning among sources. We derive annual global N2O emissions for 1990-2019 using NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML) surface N2O observations and the N2O lifetime calculated in the NASA GEOS-5 chemistry climate model (CCM). The inferred global mean N2O emissions has gradually increased from ~15.8 TgN/yr in the early 1990s to ~17.8 TgN/yr in the 2010s. This implies that anthropogenic N2O emissions have grown rapidly from ~6.7 TgN/yr in the 1990s to about ~8.7 TgN/yr in the 2010s, a ~30% increase. With specially designed N2O isotopic tracers in 3-D GEOSCCM, we estimate that, on global average, stratospheric enrichment contributes about +7.7‰/yr, +7.6‰/yr, +8.0‰/yr to tropospheric N(sup α)-δ(sup 15), N(sup β)-δ(sup 15), and O-δ(sup 18) budget, respectively. To balance the global mean isotopic signature for pre-industrial terrestrial sources of N(sup α)-δ(sup 15) ~ 6.7‰, N(sup β)-δ(sup 15) ~ -12.6‰, O-δ(sup 18) ~ 35.4‰, our 3-D isotopic budget simulation using the GEOSCCM suggests global mean anthropogenic isotopic signatures in the recent decades are N(sup α)-δ(sup 15) ~ -18‰, N(sup β)-δ(sup 15) ~ -20‰, O-δ(sup 18) ~ 19‰. These anthropogenic isotopic estimates are significantly lighter than results from one-box atmospheric model-based estimates with the largest difference seen for N(sup β)-δ(sup 15). More surface isotopic measurements are needed to better quantify the N2O isotopic signatures."

This model includes the processes of plant growth, mortality, reproduction, vegetation structural dynamics, and soil carbon and nitrogen storage and transformations. The model combines the plant physiological processes of ModelE's original vegetation model, Ent, with the plant demographic and ecosystem nitrogen processes that have been represented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's LM3-PPA. We used nine plant functional types to represent global natural vegetation functional diversity, including trees, shrubs, and grasses, and a new phenology model to simulate vegetation seasonal changes with temperature and precipitation fluctuations. Competition for light and soil resources is individual based, which makes the modeling of transient compositional dynamics and vegetation succession possible. Overall, the BiomeE model simulates, with fidelity comparable to other models, the dynamics of vegetation and soil biogeochemistry, including leaf area index, vegetation structure (e.g., height, tree density, size distribution, and crown organization), and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen storage and fluxes. This model allows ModelE to simulate transient and long-term biogeophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks between the climate system and land ecosystems. Furthermore, BiomeE also allows for the eco-evolutionary modeling of community assemblage in response to past and future climate changes with its individual-based competition and demographic processes."
1648,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220017285,2023-08-03,Contribution of Spicules to Solar Coronal Emission,"Recent high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations have generated renewed interest in spicules' role in explaining the hot corona. Some studies suggest that some spicules, often classified as type II, may provide significant mass and energy to the corona. Here we use numerical simulations to investigate whether such spicules can produce the observed coronal emission without any additional coronal heating agent. Model spicules consisting of a cold body and hot tip are injected into the base of a warm (0.5 MK) equilibrium loop with different tip temperatures and injection velocities. Both piston- and pressure-driven shocks are produced. We find that the hot tip cools rapidly and disappears from coronal emission lines such as Fe xii 195 and Fe xiv 274. Prolonged hot emission is produced by preexisting loop material heated by the shock and by thermal conduction from the shock. However, the shapes and Doppler shifts of synthetic line profiles show significant discrepancies with observations. Furthermore, spatially and temporally averaged intensities are extremely low, suggesting that if the observed intensities from the quiet Sun and active regions were solely due to type II spicules, one to several orders of magnitude more spicules would be required than have been reported in the literature. This conclusion applies strictly to the ejected spicular material. We make no claims about emissions connected with waves or coronal currents that may be generated during the ejection process and heat the surrounding area."

We perform this analysis on a sample of 133 disk-dominated galaxies from the CANDELS fields and 18 disk galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey and Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel samples. We find that both the hybrid SFR estimators and the AFUV–β relation present clear dependencies on inclination. To quantify this dependence in the hybrid SFR estimators, we derive an inclination and a far-UV–near-IR color-dependent parametric relation for converting observed UV and IR luminosities into SFRs. For the AFUV–β relation, we introduce an inclination-dependent component that accounts for the majority of the inclination dependence with the scatter of the relation increasing with inclination. We then compare both of these inclination-dependent relations to similar inclination-independent relations found in the literature. From this comparison, we find that the UV+IR correction factor and AFUV for our hybrid and AFUV–β relations, respectively, result in a reduction in the residual scatter of our sample by approximately a factor of 2. Therefore, we demonstrate that inclination must be considered in hybrid SFR estimators and the AFUV–β relation to produce more accurate SFR estimates in disk-dominated galaxies."

As a result of the progress made in demonstrating the high temperature capability of the technology, insertion into actual operational environments, such as in jet engines and planet Venus, are in progress. The high temperature, near inert surface chemistry, and radiation hardness attributes  of SiC, coupled with the relative maturation of the device batch microfabrication, contact metallization, and packaging technologies, make the material a prime candidate for use as part of future advanced nuclear reactor instrumentation and control strategy. Hence the current research efforts at NASA Glenn are aimed toward harnessing these attributes in developing SiC sensors and electronics for nuclear reactor applications, potentially for future Lunar/Martian nuclear power and the emerging terrestrial micro nuclear power plants."

As a result, GPM data have enabled a range of applications that address societal needs, including water resource management, crop forecasting, ecological monitoring, disaster response, public health, aviation, weather forecasting, and climate modeling, among others. GPM applications activities have continued to focus on user engagement through in person trainings and interviews, workshops, webinars, and educational outreach activities. The goals of these efforts are to synthesize community data needs in order to effectively support and enable decision-making across agencies, academia and the global community. While these efforts have helped the GPM mission establish a large stakeholder community that encompasses federal and state partners, academic institutions,  nd private and nonprofit companies, there remains difficulties associated with accessing, processing, and applying the data to support or enable applications. In this article, we present GPM applications strategies and approaches used to enhance the applications value of GPM data, and most importantly, demonstrate how these efforts have and can inform different decision-making contexts. This work also provides a discussion on key lessons learned from the user community and how this information can be utilized to help better support and shape applications approaches for future NASA Earth Science missions."

However, this imagery is overly simplistic and does not capture critical issues that contribute to people leaving the field. It puts distance between structural issues, our actions, and why people leave the field. When we view our research structure as something more complex, we can start taking ownership and frame more impactful solutions instead of misidentifying important issues and providing ineffective short-term solutions. 

Many of the issues discussed in the ""Cultivating a culture of inclusivity in Heliophysics"" position paper have counterparts within our policies and our institutions. To fully address and mitigate the current issues within our field, we have identified a need to cultivate a positive, safe, inclusive, and effective environment. However, we need both cultural and programmatic changes. We will try to identify systemic issues that inhibit many from fully participating and potential solutions, as well as groups and fields producing best practices for creating and enabling effective environments where innovation can occur."

For these reasons, we wanted to inspire students to consider studying biology in space by creating short, informational videos to introduce the topic. Our videos, designed for high school and college students, are focused on microbiology and include four distinct topics: the importance of studying microbes in space, the conditions they experience, how microbes experience microgravity, and how these conditions are simulated on Earth. We hope that space microbiologists use these videos to share the basics about their research, and we hope that students become inspired by the ideas presented in them."

Prohibitive factors include complex file output formats, cryptic metadata, unspecified and often customized coordinate systems, and non-linear coordinate grids. Some pockets of progress exist, giving interfaces to various simulation outputs, but only for a small set of outputs and typically not with open-source, freely available packages. Additionally, the increasing array of tools built upon these sporadic interfaces are typically model-specific. We present Kamodo’s model-agnostic satellite flythrough capabilities as the solution to the utilization barrier for heliophysics model outputs. Developed at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, these flythrough capabilities are built in Python upon a network of model-agnostic interfaces developed in collaboration with model developers, providing interpolation results the community can trust. Kamodo’s flythrough capabilities present the user with a growing variety of flythrough tools based upon a rapidly expanding library of heliophysics model outputs in several domains, currently including a variety of Ionosphere-Thermosphere-Mesosphere and global magnetosphere model outputs. Each capability is designed to be easily accessible via simplistic model-agnostic syntax, with the entire package freely available in the cloud on Github. Here, we describe the tools developed, include several sample applications for common science questions, demonstrate interoperability with selected packages, and summarize ongoing developments."

Here we quantify changes in methane sources and in its atmospheric sink in 2020 compared with 2019. We find that, globally, total anthropogenic emissions decreased by 1.2 ± 0.1 teragrams of methane per year (Tg CH4 yr−1), fire emissions decreased by 6.5 ± 0.1 Tg CH4 yr−1 and wetland emissions increased by 6.0 ± 2.3 Tg CH4 yr−1. Tropospheric OH concentration decreased by 1.6 ± 0.2 per cent relative to 2019, mainly as a result of lower anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and associated lower free tropospheric ozone during pandemic lockdowns(2). From atmospheric inversions, we also infer that global net emissions increased by 6.9 ± 2.1 Tg CH4 yr−1 in 2020 relative to 2019, and global methane removal from reaction with OH decreased by 7.5 ± 0.8 Tg CH4 yr−1. Therefore, we attribute the methane growth rate anomaly in 2020 relative to 2019 to lower OH sink (53 ± 10 per cent) and higher natural emissions (47 ± 16 per cent), mostly from wetlands. In line with previous findings(3,4,) our results imply that wetland methane emissions are sensitive to a warmer and wetter climate and could act as a positive feedback mechanism in the future. Our study also suggests that nitrogen oxide emission trends need to be taken into account when implementing the global anthropogenic methane emissions reduction pledge(5)."

Specifically, the Pseudo-nitzschia genus possesses harmful toxins that can induce food-borne illnesses and infect humans through ambient water. We observed in-situ data from known 2016 and 2020 Pseudo-nitzschia blooms as case studies to test the feasibility of using satellite data to track bloom events. In order to map the frequency and distribution of Pseudo-nitzschia bloom events, we used satellite data from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We utilized Earth observation data to calculate normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) and absorption by phytoplankton (aph443), which are satellite products that more accurately depict phytoplankton reflectance. We compared these products with in-situ observations in order to analyze ocean color differences and distinguish diatomic algal particles from other organic and inorganic particles."

Heat is unevenly distributed within cities due to factors such as income inequality, historical discriminatory practices like redlining, and divestment in neighborhoods of color. This leads to less vegetation and more heat-absorbing infrastructure in specific communities. Moreover, adverse effects of heat, including heat-related morbidity and mortality, disproportionately impact populations that experience vulnerability through social inequities and structural discrimination. Heat vulnerability is a combination of the factors of heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, and can be harnessed to guide urban heat interventions. This DEVELOP project partnered with the City of Wichita to understand the spatial distribution and drivers of UHIs and heat vulnerability indicators. The team modeled outcomes of tree cover interventions using Landsat 8’s Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Operational Land Imager (OLI), Landsat 9 TIRS-2 and OLI-2, and the International Space Station’s Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on the International Space Station (ECOSTRESS) sensor, along with the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) Urban Cooling model. The team also leveraged statistical analysis by implementing principal component analysis to develop a heat vulnerability index (HVI) specific to Wichita. Ultimately, the project’s outputs will inform the City of Wichita’s Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Plan, identify priority areas for heat mitigation initiatives, and be used in public-facing communications to educate communities on the impacts of urban heat."

significant effort has begun to develop methods of In-Situ Resource Utilization. Many of these methods involve excavation and manipulation of local regolith and, at this time, many of these missions are in the early planning phases. As such, simulations provide both an inexpensive and relatively easy method to perform high level proofs of concept and mission overviews along with an environment to perform machine learning for rovers and other robots.

The Simulated Excavation Environment for Lunar Operations (SEELO) was born out of this need for consolidated capabilities. SEELO seeks to provide accurate life mission environments and regolith interaction mechanics while remaining lightweight enough to run in faster than real-time. These combined features allow SEELO to be used for mission planning purposes that offer an environment for lunar robots to perform Machine Learning on moving, digging, and various other activities. Using the Real-Time Development Platform (Unity) to utilize regolith excavation models created by Intelligent Capabilities Enhanced-Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot and lunar surface data collected by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, SEELO has been able to provide NASA with a tool to plan, train, and even devise lunar missions."

Some form of agriculture will be required because plants produce the vitamins, antioxidants, and essential oils in our diets that degrade over time in stored foods. In addition, they provide dietary fiber, restore air, and purify water. Growing plants will require recycling nutrients trapped in inedible vegetation. Researchers at KSC have investigated the use of a thermal plasma with various carrier gases to thermally degrade inedible plant biomass for nutrient recovery. Previous work demonstrated a thermally degrading environment such as a muffle furnace improved nutrient recovery from inedible biomass prior to an acid leaching process. However, a muffle furnace is an inefficient process. We have explored the use of a small scale, thermal plasma for degradation of pellets to enhance the breakdown of plant stems, leaves, and debris to further close the nutrient loop. Plasma carrier gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2),  nitrogen (N2), and air were used to explore variations in recovery and potential chemical by-products. Plasma processed inedible biomass was added to varying concentrations of acid solution for leaching of nutrients (e.g. potassium (K)  , magnesium (Mg),  calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P)) for reuse in the crop production cycle. We also examined total N2 recovery. Results are presented showing the impact of plasma processing prior to acid leaching on recovery of plant nutrients."

This release greatly affected the communities that rely on the river for farming, recreation, and tourism. In partnership with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WYDEQ), Shoshone River Partners, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Wyoming–Montana Water Science Center, this project utilized satellite imagery and precipitation data to examine turbidity patterns in the Shoshone River between the Buffalo Bill Dam and the Willwood Dam. We used PlanetScope satellite images to assess changes in surface reflectance of the river in response to precipitation events and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-Spectral Retrieval (IMERG) precipitation data to estimate the lag time between rainfall events and increased turbidity. The National Land Cover Dataset (2019) was used to identify the main land cover types within each sub-basin. The end products included a turbidity analysis, land cover analysis, and precipitation analysis that provided the partners with a better understanding of sediment dynamics in the river. The results demonstrated the feasibility of using PlanetScope data to examine turbidity spatially along small rivers. Sediment plumes from tributaries were visually identified for multiple high turbidity events, and we calibrated an equation that translated reflectance to turbidity, accurately representing plume extent. Inconsistent spectral quality of PlanetScope data, however, limited our ability to assess the relative sediment contribution of the tributaries."

It is considered a crucial driver of energy transport and mass loss within Saturn's magnetosphere. On longterm timescales, is thought to be predominantly driven by the rapid rotation of equatorially mass-loaded flux tubes (i.e., the Vasyliunas cycle), but there is some non-negligible driving from the solar wind as well (i.e., the Dungey cycle). In this study, we investigate an atmospheric driven phenomenon that modulates Saturn's magnetosphere every ∼10.6–10.8 hr, known as planetary period oscillations (PPOs), as an additional driver of magnetic reconnection at Saturn. Using an empirical model of PPO dynamics and Cassini magnetic field and plasma measurements, we find that PPO-driven magnetic reconnection is likely to occur in Saturn's magnetosphere, however, the occurrence of the phenomenon depends on temporally variable characteristics of the PPO systems and spatial asymmetries within Saturn's equatorial magnetosphere. Thus, it is not expected to be an on-going process. On year-long timescales, we find that PPOs are expected to be on par with the Dungey Cycle in driving circulation within Saturn's magnetosphere. However, on ∼1–2 weeks-long timescales, under specific conditions where PPO-driven reconnection is expected to be active, this phenomenon can become more significant than the Vasyliunas cycle, and thus dominate circulation within Saturn's magnetosphere. On year-long timescales, this process is estimated to remove upwards of ∼20% of the mass loaded into the magnetosphere by Enceladus."

Adoption of these advanced data science methods had quickly outpaced institutional response, but many professional organizations such as the European Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the American Geophysical Union have now issued (or will soon issue) standards for artificial intelligence and machine learning that will impact scientific research. These standards add further (necessary) burdens on the individual researcher who must now prepare the public release of data and code in addition to traditional paper writing. Support for these is not reflected in the current state of institutional support, community practices, or governance systems. We examine here some of these principles and how our institutions and community can promote their successful adoption within the Heliophysics discipline."

Using a τS fiducial design with six frequency bands between 150 and 380 GHz, with white and uniform map noise of 7 μK arcmin, achievable with a single midlatitude flight, and including Planck's 30 and 44 GHz data, we assess the error σ(τ) obtained with three foreground models and as a function of sky fraction f</sub><sub>sky</sub> between 40% and 54%. We carry out the analysis using both parametric and blind foreground separation techniques. We compare the σ(τ) values to those obtained with low-frequency and high-frequency versions of the experiment called τS-lf and τS-hf, which have only four and up to eight frequency bands with narrower and wider frequency coverage, respectively. We find that with τS, the lowest constraint is σ(τ) = 0.0034, obtained for one of the foreground models with f</sub><sub>sky</sub> = 54%. σ(τ) is larger, in some cases by more than a factor of 2, for smaller sky fractions, with τS-lf, or as a function of foreground model. The τS-hf configuration does not lead to significantly tighter constraints. The exclusion of the 30 and 44 GHz data, which give information about synchrotron emission, leads to significant τ misestimates. Decreasing noise by an ambitious factor of 10, while keeping f</sub><sub>sky</sub> = 40%, gives σ(τ) = 0.0031. The combination of σ(τ) = 0.0034, baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI, and future cosmic microwave background B-mode lensing data from the CMB-S3/CMB-S4 experiments could give σ(∑m </sub><sub>v</sub>) = 17 meV."

All classification systems require rules for lumping similar objects into the same category, while splitting differing objects into separate categories. Mineralogical classification systems are no exception. Our work in placing mineral species within their evolutionary contexts necessitates this lumping and splitting because we classify “mineral natural kinds” based on unique combinations of formational environments and continuous temperature-pressure-composition phase space. Consequently, we lump two minerals into a single natural kind only if they: (1) are part of a continuous solid solution; (2) are isostructural or members of a homologous series; and (3) form by the same process. A systematic survey based on these criteria suggests that 2310 (~41%) of 5659 IMA-approved mineral species can be lumped with one or more other mineral species, corresponding to 667 “root mineral kinds,” of which 353 lump pairs of mineral species, while 129 lump three species. Eight mineral groups, including cancrinite, eudialyte, hornblende, jahnsite, labuntsovite, satorite, tetradymite, and tourmaline, are represented by 20 or more lumped IMA-approved mineral species. A list of 5659 IMA-approved mineral species corresponds to 4016 root mineral kinds according to these lumping criteria.

 The evolutionary system of mineral classification assigns an IMA-approved mineral species to two or more mineral natural kinds under either of two splitting criteria: (1) if it forms in two or more distinct paragenetic environments, or (2) if cluster analysis of the attributes of numerous specimens reveals more than one discrete combination of chemical and physical attributes. A total of 2310 IMA-approved species are known to form by two or more paragenetic processes and thus correspond to multiple mineral natural kinds; however, adequate data resources are not yet in hand to perform cluster analysis on more than a handful of mineral species. 

We find that 1623 IMA-approved species (~29%) correspond exactly to mineral natural kinds; i.e., they are known from only one paragenetic environment and are not lumped with another species in our evolutionary classification. Greater complexity is associated with 587 IMA-approved species that are both lumped with one or more other species and occur in two or more paragenetic environments. In these instances, identification of mineral natural kinds may involve both lumping and splitting of the corresponding IMA-approved species on the basis of multiple criteria.

 Based on the numbers of root mineral kinds, their known varied modes of formation, and predictions of minerals that occur on Earth but are as yet undiscovered and described, we estimate that Earth holds more than 10000 mineral natural kinds."

These measurements demonstrate that radio holography of complex millimeter-wave optical systems comprising cryogenic lenses, filters, and feed horns can provide detailed characterization of wave propagation before deployment. We used the measured amplitude and phase, at 4 K, of the receiver near-field beam pattern to predict two key performance parameters: 1) the amount of scattered light that will spill past the telescope to 300 K and 2) the beam pattern expected from the receiver when fielded on the telescope. These cryogenic measurements informed the removal of a filter, which led to improved optical efficiency and reduced sidelobes at the exit of the receiver. Holography measurements of this system suggest that the spilled power past the telescope mirrors will be less than 1%, and the main beam with its near sidelobes are consistent with the nominal telescope design. This is the first time such parameters have been confirmed in the lab prior to deployment of a new receiver. This approach is broadly applicable to millimeter and submillimeter instruments."

Here we present observations of the grounding line retreat of these glaciers since 2014 using a constellation of interferometric radar satellites combined with precision surface elevation data. We find that the grounding lines develop spatially-variable, kilometre-scale, tidally-induced migration zones. After correction for tidal effects, we detect a sustained pattern of retreat coincident with high melt rates of un-grounded ice, marked by episodes of more rapid retreat. In 2017, Pope Glacier retreated 3.5 km in 3.6 months, or 11.7 km/yr. In 2016-2018, Smith West retreated at 2 km/yr and Kohler at 1.3 km/yr. While the retreat slowed down in 2018-2020, these retreat rates are faster than anticipated by numerical models on yearly time scales. We hypothesize that the rapid retreat is caused by un-represented, vigorous ice-ocean interactions acting within newly-formed cavities at the ice-ocean boundary."

Their origin in the largely unipolar coronal holes has long been a mystery. Earlier spectroscopic and imaging observations revealed blueshifted plasma and propagating disturbances (PDs) in plumes that are widely interpreted in terms of flows and/or propagating slow-mode waves, but these interpretations (flows versus waves) remain under debate. Recently we discovered an important clue about plume internal structure: dynamic filamentary features called plumelets, which account for most of the plume emission. Here we present high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph that revealed numerous, quasi-periodic, tiny jets (so-called jetlets) associated with transient brightening, flows, and plasma heating at the chromospheric footpoints of the plumelets. By analogy to larger coronal jets, these jetlets are most likely produced within the plume base by magnetic reconnection between closed and open flux at stressed 3D null points. The jetlet-associated brightenings are in phase with plumelet-associated PDs, and vary with a period of ∼3–5 minutes, which is remarkably consistent with the photospheric/chromospheric p-mode oscillation. This reconnection at the open-closed boundary in the chromosphere/transition region is likely modulated or driven by local manifestations of the global p-mode waves. The jetlets extend upward to become plumelets, contribute mass to the solar wind, and may be sources of the switchbacks recently detected by the Parker Solar Probe."

Solar flares release an enormous amount of energy (~10(exp 32) erg) into the corona. A substantial fraction of this energy is transported to the lower atmosphere, which results in chromospheric heating. The mechanisms that transport energy to the lower solar atmosphere during a flare are still not fully understood.

Aims. We aim to estimate the temporal evolution of the radiative losses in the chromosphere at the footpoints of a C-class flare, in order to set observational constraints on the electron beam parameters of a RADYN flare simulation.

Methods. We estimated the radiative losses from hydrogen, and singly ionized Ca and Mg using semiempirical model atmospheres, which were inferred from a multiline inversion of observed Stokes profiles obtained with the CRISP and CHROMIS instruments on the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. The radiative losses were computed taking into account the effect of partial redistribution and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium. To estimate the integrated radiative losses in the chromosphere, the net cooling rates were integrated between the temperature minimum and the height where the temperature reaches 10 kK. We also compared our time series of radiative losses with those from the RADYN flare simulations.

Results. We obtained a high spatial-resolution map of integrated radiative losses around the flare peak time. The stratification of the net cooling rate suggests that the Ca IR triplet lines are responsible for most of the radiative losses in the flaring atmosphere. During the flare peak time, the contribution from Ca II H and K and Mgii h and k lines are strong and comparable to the Ca IR triplet (~32kW m(exp -2)). Since our flare is a relatively weak event, the chromosphere is not heated above 11 kK, which in turn yields a subdued Lyα contribution (~7kW m(exp -2)) in the selected limits of the chromosphere. The temporal evolution of total integrated radiative losses exhibits sharply rising losses (0.4kW m(exp -2) (s(exp -1)) and a relatively slow decay (0.23kW m(exp -2) s(exp -1)). The maximum value of total radiative losses is reached around the flare peak time and can go up to 175kWm􀀀2 for a single pixel located at footpoint. After a small parameter study, we find the best model-data consistency in terms of the amplitude of radiative losses and the overall atmospheric structure with a RADYN flare simulation in the injected energy flux of 5 × 10(exp 10) erg s(exp -1) cm(exp -2)."

EEP increases the production of NO<sub>x</sub> and HO<sub>x</sub>, which will catalytically destroy ozone, an important element of atmospheric dynamics. Therefore, measurement of the latitudinal extent of the precipitation boundaries is important in quantifying the atmospheric effects of the Sun-Earth interaction. This study uses measurements by the Medium Energy Proton Electron Detector (MEPED) of six NOAA/POES and EUMETSAT/METOP satellites from 2004 to 2014 to determine the latitudinal boundaries of EEP and their variability with geomagnetic activity and solar wind drivers. Variation of the boundaries for different electron energies and Magnetic Local Time (MLT) is studied. Regression analyses are applied to determine the best predictor variable based on solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices. The highest correlation was found for the pressure-corrected Dst index when applying a linear regression model. A model of the equatorward EEP boundary is developed separately for three different energy channels, >43, >114, and >292 keV, and for 3 hour MLT sectors. For >43 keV EEP, 80% of the equatorward boundaries predicted by the model are within ±2.2° cgmlat. The model exhibits a solar cycle bias where it systematically exaggerates the equatorward movement of the EEP region during solar minimum. The highest accuracy of the model is found in periods dominated by corotating interaction regions/high speed solar wind streams. The result will be a key element for constructing a model of EEP variability to be applied in atmosphere climate models."

Star formation in the outer Galaxy, namely, outside of the Solar circle, has not been extensively studied in part due to the low CO brightness of the molecular clouds linked with the negative metallicity gradient. Recent infrared surveys provide an overview
of dust emission in large sections of the Galaxy, but they suffer from cloud confusion and poor spatial resolution at far-infrared wavelengths. 
Aims. We aim to develop a methodology to identify and classify young stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy and use it to resolve a long-standing disparity in terms of the distance and evolutionary status of IRAS 22147+5948.
Methods. We used a support vector machine learning algorithm to complement standard color–color and color–magnitude diagrams in our search for YSOs in the IRAS 22147 region, based on publicly available data from the Spitzer Mapping of the Outer Galaxy survey. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to identify clusters. Then the physical properties of individual YSOs were calculated. The distances were determined using CO 1–0 from the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory survey.
Results. We identified 13 Class I and 13 Class II YSO candidates using the color–color diagrams, along with an additional 2 and 21 sources, respectively, using the applied machine learning techniques. The spectral energy distributions of 23 sources were modeled with a star and a passive disk, corresponding to Class II objects. The models of three sources include envelopes that are typical for Class I objects. The objects were grouped into two clusters located at a distance of 2:2 kpc and 5 clusters at 5:6 kpc. The spatial extent of CO, radio continuum, and dust emission confirms the origin of YSOs in two distinct star-forming regions along a similar line of sight.
Conclusions. The outer Galaxy may serve as a unique laboratory for exploring star formation across environments, on the condition that complementary methods and ancillary data are used to properly account for cloud confusion and distance uncertainties."

Measurements of stable carbon isotopes of methane can constrain emissions if the isotopic compositions are known; however, isotopic compositions of methane emissions from wetlands are poorly constrained despite their importance. Here, we use a process-based biogeochemistry model to calculate the stable carbon isotopic composition of global wetland methane emissions. We estimate a mean global signature of −61.3 ± 0.7‰ and find that tropical wetland emissions are enriched by ~11‰ relative to boreal wetlands. Our model shows improved resolution of regional, latitudinal and global variations in isotopic composition of wetland emissions. Atmospheric simulation scenarios with the improved wetland isotopic composition suggest that increases in atmospheric methane since 2007 are attributable to rising microbial emissions. Our findings  substantially reduce uncertainty in the stable carbon isotopic composition of methane emissions from wetlands and improve understanding of the global methane budget."

However, little quantitative capability is available to assess these metrics of cyanoHABs across broad geographic scales and at regular intervals. Here, the spatial extent was quantified from a cyanobacteria algorithm applied to two European Space Agency satellite platforms—the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard Envisat and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3. CyanoHAB spatial extent was defined for each geographic area as the percentage of valid satellite pixels that exhibited cyanobacteria above the detection limit of the satellite sensor. This study quantified cyanoHAB spatial extent for over 2,000 large lakes and reservoirs across the contiguous United States (CONUS) during two time periods: 2008–2011 via MERIS and 2017–2020 via OLCI when cloud-, ice-, and snow-free imagery was available. Approximately 56% of resolvable lakes were glaciated, 13% were headwater, isolated, or terminal lakes, and the rest were primarily drainage lakes. Results were summarized at national-, regional-, state-, and lake-scales, where regions were defined as nine climate regions which represent climatically consistent states. As measured by satellite, changes in national cyanoHAB extent did have a strong increase of 6.9% from 2017 to 2020 (|Kendall’s tau (τ)| = 0.56; gamma (γ) = 2.87 years), but had negligible change (|τ| = 0.03) from 2008 to 2011. Two of the nine regions had moderate (0.3 ≤ |τ| < 0.5) increases in spatial extent from 2017 to 2020, and eight of nine regions had negligible (|τ| < 0.2) change from 2008 to 2011. Twelve states had a strong or moderate increase from 2017 to 2020 (|τ| ≥ 0.3), while only one state had a moderate increase and two states had a moderate decrease from 2008 to 2011. A decrease, or no change, in cyanoHAB spatial extent did not indicate a lack of issues related to cyanoHABs. Sensitivity results of randomly omitted daily CONUS scenes confirm that even with reduced data availability during a short four-year temporal assessment, the direction and strength of the changes in spatial extent remained consistent. We present the first set of national maps of lake cyanoHAB spatial extent across CONUS and demonstrate an approach for quantifying past and future changes at multiple spatial scales. Results presented here provide water quality managers information regarding current cyanoHAB spatial extent and quantify rates of change."

Basic properties of the waves were determined through analysis of 7 Mars years of temperature profiles from the Mars Climate Sounder on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. A more complete understanding of the waves was derived from a simulation with the NASA Ames Mars General Circulation Model. This type of wave appears in the tropics in the vicinity of conspicuous surface features, such as large volcanoes and the rim of Isidis Planitia. The amplitude is typically 5–10 K, the vertical wavelength is about 40 km, the zonal wavelength is about 1400 km, and the zonal phase speed relative to the surface is about 25 m s−1. The wave forcing comes from horizontal convergence of the near-surface winds, which generates a daily surge in the vertical winds. These convergence zones were not previously recognized as an important source of atmospheric waves on Mars. Strong forcing occurs only within a limited range of local time, producing wave packets (diurnal pulses) rather than steady oscillations. Waves are present throughout the year and their properties vary with season. Near the solstices, the wave amplitude is largest in the tropics of the summer hemisphere, where the convergence zones are stronger than in the winter hemisphere. The diurnal-mean zonal winds, which vary with latitude and season, control the direction of propagation of the predominant waves through filtering by critical levels."

Moreover, the impacts of climate change, including elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), increased stratification, and warmer sea surface temperatures, will likely shape phytoplankton community composition in the global ocean. Chemotaxonomic methods are useful for modeling phytoplankton community composition from marker pigments normalized to chlorophyll a (Chl a). However, photosynthetic pigments, particularly Chl a, are sensitive to nutrient and light conditions. Cellular carbon is less sensitive, so using carbon biomass instead may provide an alternative approach. To this end, cellular pigment and carbon concentrations were measured in 51 strains of globally relevant, cultured phytoplankton. Pigment-to-Chl a and pigment-to-carbon ratios were computed for each strain. For 25 strains, measurements were taken during two growth phases. While some differences between growth phases were observed, they did not exceed within class differences. Multiple strains of Amphidinium carterae, Ditylum brightwellii and Heterosigma akashiwo were measured to determine whether time in culture influenced pigment and carbon composition. No appreciable trends in cellular pigment or carbon content were observed. Lastly, the potential impact of climate change conditions on the pigment ratios was assessed using a multistressor experiment that included increased mean light, temperature, and elevated pCO2 on three species: Thalassiosira oceanica, Ostreococcus lucimarinus, and Synechococcus. The largest differences were observed in the pigment-to-carbon ratios, while the marker pigments largely covaried with Chl a. The implications of these observations to chemotaxonomic applications are discussed."

The regions 30 Dor, N159, and N113 are actively forming massive stars, while the Molecular Ridge is forming almost no massive stars, despite its large reservoir of molecular gas and proximity to N159 and 30 Dor. We segment the emission from each region into hierarchical structures using dendrograms and analyze the sizes, masses, and line widths of these structures. We find that the Ridge has significantly lower kinetic energy at a given size scale and also lower surface densities than the other regions, resulting in higher virial parameters. This suggests that the Ridge is not forming massive stars as actively as the other regions because it has less dense gas and not because collapse is suppressed by excess kinetic energy. We also find that these physical conditions and energy balance vary significantly within the Ridge and that this variation appears only weakly correlated with distance from sites of massive-star formation such as R136 in 30 Dor, which is ∼1 kpc away. These variations also show only a weak correlation with local star formation activity within the clouds."

Despite considerable progress, accurate estimates of daily ocean productivity from space have not been realized because polar-orbiting satellites are unable to account for variations in phytoplankton physiology and carbon fixation rates from changing incident irradiance levels over the course of the day. Here we have attempted to exploit the unique short-temporal measurements provided by the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), to obtain for the first time, diurnal and daily measurements of surface- and euphotic-column integrated Net Primary Productivity (NPP). These estimates are based on the Absorption Based Productivity Model (AbPM), and are calibrated with a bio-optical database of measurements made at different times of the day during the Korea-US Ocean Color (KORUS-OC) cruise in May–June 2016. Photo-physiological rate estimates, varied across different water types encountered around the Korean Peninsula, but on account of their limited number, were regionally scaled through the use of dynamic optical-biogeochemical (O-BGC) Biomes. Comparisons of GOCI derived estimates of daily and weekly integrated NPP against in-situ measurements, clearly underscore the superiority of geostationary over polar-orbiting ocean color satellites, which consider the strong short-term fluctuations in phytoplankton light absorption and incident irradiance fields over the course of the day."

We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations to study the interaction of coronal magnetic fields with emerging flux and determine the conditions that lead to eruptive activity. A simple parameter study is performed, varying the relative angle between emerging magnetic flux and a preexisting coronal dipole field. We find that in all cases the emergence results in a sheared magnetic arcade that transitions to a twisted coronal flux rope via low-lying magnetic reconnection. This structure, however, is constrained by its own outer field and so is noneruptive in the absence of reconnection with the overlying coronal field. The amount of this overlying reconnection is determined by the relative angle between the emerged and preexisting fields. The reconnection between emerging and preexisting fields is necessary to generate sufficient expansion of the emerging structure so that flare-like reconnection below the coronal flux rope becomes strong enough to trigger its release. Our results imply that the relative angle is the key parameter in determining whether the resultant active regions exhibit eruptive behavior and is thus a potentially useful candidate for predicting eruptions in newly emerging active regions. More generally, our results demonstrate that the detailed interaction between the convection zone/photosphere and the corona must be calculated self-consistently in order to model solar eruptions accurately."

Minerals provide a record of Earth’s evolving surface and interior chemistry in geologic time due to many diferent processes (e.g. tectonic, volcanic, sedimentary, oxidative, etc.). Here, we show how the bipartite network of minerals and their shared constituent elements expanded and evolved over geologic time. To further investigate network expansion over time, we derive and apply a novel metric (weighted mineral element electronegativity coefcient of variation; wMEECV) to quantify intra-mineral electronegativity variation with respect to redox. We fnd that element electronegativity and hard soft acid base (HSAB) properties are central factors in mineral redox chemistry under a wide range of conditions. Global shifts in mineral element electronegativity and HSAB associations represented by wMEECV changes at 1.8 and 0.6 billion years ago align with decreased continental elevation followed by the transition from the intermediate ocean and glaciation eras to postglaciation, increased atmospheric oxygen in the Phanerozoic, and enhanced continental weathering. Consequently, network analysis of mineral element electronegativity and HSAB properties reveal that orogenic activity, evolving redox state of the mantle, planetary oxygenation, and climatic transitions directly impacted the evolving chemical complexity of Earth’s crust."

VOD is indicative of the vegetation water content (VWC) because it captures the extinction of land surface emission. If the connectivity of VOD to VWC is robust, the pair of VWC-SM observations can be viable bases for understanding soil–plant–atmosphere water relations, providing new perspectives on ecosystem science. Simultaneous SM–VOD retrievals are feasible by inverting the τ−ω model with two independent datasets in dual-channel algorithms. However, given correlated satellite vertical and horizontal brightness temperatures (TBs; TB v and TB<sub>h</sub> ), an ill-posed inverse problem arises where TB errors result in high uncertainties of retrievals. In this study, we apply the degrees-of-information (DoI) metric and propose a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) metric to assess the “retrievability” of VOD given the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) TB v –TB h linear dependence. The application of these metrics allows determining where the VOD retrievals are robust and reliable. This is a necessary step in supporting the applications of VOD in ecology and hydrology. Results show that regions with mainly nonwoody vegetation have the best potential for VOD retrievals, though regularization is necessary. We then assess VOD time variations from two regularization products that reduce the impact of underdetermined inversions: the L3 dual-channel algorithm (L3-DCA) and the multitemporal dual-channel algorithm (MTDCA), which constrain VOD time dynamics with and without using a priori VOD climatology, respectively. Though they both reduce noise, especially in the VOD retrievals, they result in differences in VOD seasonal amplitude and coupling to SM at high frequencies as we outline here."

However, its habit-ability could be strongly affected by the unknown availability of phosphorus (P). Here, we perform thermodynamic and kinetic modeling that simulates P geochemistry based on recent insights into the geochemistry of the ocean–seafloor system on Enceladus. We find that aqueous P should predominantly exist as orthophosphate (e.g., HPO422), and total dissolved inorganic P could reach 1027to 1022mol/kg H2O, generally increasing with lower pH and higher dissolved CO2, but also depending upon dissolved ammonia and silica. Levels are much higher than<10210mol/kg H2Ofrompreviousestimatesand close to or higher than∼1026mol/kg H2O in modern Earth seawater. The high P concentration is primarily ascribed to a high (bi)carbonate concentration, which decreases the concentrations of multivalent cations via carbonate mineral formation, allowing phosphate to accumulate. Kinetic modeling of phosphate mineral dissolution suggests that geologically rapid release of P from seafloor weathering of a chondritic rocky core could supply millimoles of total dissolved P per kilogram of H2Owithin105y, much less than the likely age of Enceladus’s ocean (108to 109y). These results provide further evidence of habitable ocean conditions and show that any oceanic life would not be inhibited by low P availability."

Grids of Models at Solar, LMC, and SMC Metallicities","Magnetic fields can drastically change predictions of evolutionary models of massive stars via mass-loss quenching, magnetic braking, and efficient angular momentum transport, which we aim to quantify in this work. We use the MESA software instrument to compute an e xtensiv e main-sequence grid of stellar structure and evolution models, as well as isochrones, accounting for the effects attributed to a surface fossil magnetic field. The grid is densely populated in initial mass (3–60 M ), surface equatorial magnetic field strength (0–50 kG), and metallicity (representative of the Solar neighbourhood and the Magellanic Clouds). We use two magnetic braking and two chemical mixing schemes and compare the model predictions for slowly rotating, nitrogen- enriched (‘Group 2’) stars with observations in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We quantify a range of initial field strengths that allow for producing Group 2 stars and find that typical values (up to a few kG) lead to solutions. Between the subgrids, we find notable departures in surface abundances and evolutionary paths. In our magnetic models, chemical mixing is al w ays less efficient compared to non-magnetic models due to the rapid spin-down. We identify that quasi-chemically homogeneous main sequence evolution by efficient mixing could be prevented by fossil magnetic fields. We recommend comparing this grid of evolutionary models with spectropolarimetric and spectroscopic observations with the goals of (i) revisiting the derived stellar parameters of known magnetic stars, and (ii) observationally constraining the uncertain magnetic braking and chemical mixing schemes."

Westward tidal winds near 115 km at the magnetic equator occur during part of the upward phase of the in-situ plasma drift. Vertical motions associated with the field-aligned plasma velocity occur away from the magnetic equator. The morphology of the lunar tide, and the phasing between the airglow and plasma velocities are consistent with E × B drift as a mechanism for linking neutral wind and plasma perturbations. This work provides the first observational quantification of global-scale E- and F-region coupling through E × B and field-aligned vertical drifts.

Plain Language Summary: Tidal winds propagating upward from the neutral atmosphere influence ionospheric dynamo electric fields and vertical plasma drifts. However, these mechanisms have never been fully identified in comprehensive and simultaneous measurements spanning the ionosphere-thermosphere-mesosphere (ITM) system. The atmospheric lunar tide is an effective marker of ITM coupling because it originates at Earth's surface, propagates vertically, and is fully sampled in daytime-only and post-sunset satellite measurements. We utilize measurements from two new NASA missions to track the lunar tide in neutral and plasma velocities, and in an electron density proxy. Our work provides observational confirmation, and quantitative estimates of F-region vertical plasma motions driven by neutral winds and electrodynamical forces"

However, the derivation of Nd from satellite data depends on a number of assumptions about the cloud and the accuracy of the retrievals of the cloud properties from which it is derived, making it prone to systematic biases.

A number of sampling strategies have been proposed to address these biases by selecting the most accurate Nd retrievals in the satellite data. This work compares the impact of these strategies on the accuracy of the satellite retrieved Nd, using a selection of in situ measurements. In stratocumulus regions, the MODIS Nd retrieval is able to achieve a high precision (r2 of 0.5–0.8). This is lower in other cloud regimes but can be increased by appropriate sampling choices. Although the Nd sampling can have significant effects on the Nd climatology, it produces only a 20 % variation in the implied radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions, with the choice of aerosol proxy driving the overall uncertainty. The results are summarised into recommendations for using MODIS Nd products and appropriate sampling."

Given the negative ecological impacts of biodiversity loss in grasslands, there is an urgent need for developing an operational biodiversity monitoring system that functions in these ecosystems. In this paper, we assessed the capability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (also known as hyperspectral imaging) to capture plant α-diversity in a large naturally-assembled grassland while considering the impact of common management practices, specifically prescribed fire. We collected a robust in-situ plant diversity data set, including species composition and percent cover from 2500 sampling points with different burn ages, from recently-burned to transitional and pre-prescribed fire at the Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma, USA. We expressed in-situ plant α-diversity using the first three Hill numbers, including species richness (number of observed species in a plant community), exponential Shannon entropy index (hereafter Shannon diversity; effective number of common species, where species are weighed proportional to their percent cover), and inverse Simpson concentration index (hereafter Simpson diversity; effective number of dominant species, where more weight is given to dominant species) at four different plot sizes, including 60 m × 60 m, 120 m × 120 m, 180 m × 180 m, and 240 m × 240 m. We collected full-range airborne hyperspectral data with fine spatial resolution (1 m) and visible and near-infrared spaceborne hyperspectral data from DESIS sensor with coarse spatial resolution (30 m), and used the spectral diversity hypothesis—i.e., that the variability in spectral data is largely driven by plant diversity—to estimate α-diversity remotely. In recently-burned plots and those at the transitional stage, both airborne and spaceborne data were capable of capturing Simpson diversity—a metric that calculates the effective number of dominant species by emphasizing abundant species and discounting rare species—but not species richness or Shannon diversity. Further, neither airborne nor spaceborne hyperspectral data sets were capable of capturing plant α-diversity of 60 m × 60 m or 120 m × 120 m plots. Based on these results, three main findings emerged: (1) management practices influence grassland biodiversity patterns that can be remotely detected, (2) both fine- and coarse-resolution remotely-sensed data can detect the effective number of dominant species (e.g., Simpson diversity), and (3) attention should be given to site-specific plant diversity field data collection to appropriately interpret remote sensing results. Findings of this study indicate the feasibility of estimating Simpson diversity in naturally-assembled grasslands using forthcoming spaceborne imagers such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Surface Biology and Geology mission."

It allows changes in properties of a system to be attributed to changes in multiple variables associated with that system. There are many possible factorisation methods; here we discuss three previously-proposed factorisations that have been applied in the field of climate modelling: the linear factorisation, the Stein and Alpert (1993) factorisation, and the Lunt et al (2012) factorisation. We show that, when more than two variables are being considered, none of these three methods possess all three properties of ""uniqueness"", ""symmetry"", and ""completeness"". Here, we extend each of these factorisations so that they do possess these properties for any number of variables, resulting in three factorisations – the ""linear-sum"" factorisation, the ""shared-interaction"" factorisation, and the ""scaled-total"" factorisation. We show that the linear-sum factorisation and the shared-interaction factorisation reduce to be identical. We present the results of the factorisations in the context of studies that used the previously-proposed factorisations. This reveals that only the linear-sum/shared-interaction factorisation possesses a fourth property – ""boundedness"", and as such we recommend the use of this factorisation in applications for which these properties are desirable."

The Mach 0.80 TTBW vehicle is a high wing, high aspect ratio configuration, designed for a high  lift-to-drag ratio.  System  studies  have  predicted significant  fuel  burn  and  emissions  benefits  with  the  TTBW technology  moving  toward  meeting  NASA  Subsonic  Transport  Systems-Level-Metrics.    A  4.5%  scale  Mach  0.80 design TTBW model was recently tested at the NASA Ames Research Center 11-by 11-Foot Transonic Wind Tunnel(11-Ft  TWT),providing  a  valuable  dataset  to  validate  computational  tools  and  investigate  best  practices  as  risk reduction  efforts  continue  for  the  development  of  the  advanced  TTBW  vehicle.    The  NASA  Computational  Fluid Dynamics (CFD) team has computed free-air flow solutions on the Mach 0.80 design flight configuration and two wind tunnel configuration variants using the USM3D and LAVA flow solvers.  Accurate modeling of the configuration tested in the wind tunnel environment is critical to validating the CFD tools, thus the team has included the internal cavity region and sting in their modeling of the configuration, similar to that tested in the 11-Ft TWT.  Overall, the CFD simulations compared well and show similar trends as the corrected experimental data for lift and drag polars. The CFD predicted lift curve is shifted in angle of attack from what was observed in the experiment.  The shift in lift also was seen in the pitching moment comparison plots.  CFD solutions were computed at constant CL test point values and showed overall very good agreement when comparing constant spanwise cuts of pressure coefficient data on the wing and strut with experimental data. CFD cavity corrections were also investigated using the 11-Ft TWT cavity correction method, similar to that used to correct the wind tunnel data.  Results showed some improvement in pitching moment coefficient predictions, and an increase in drag, shifting the data to the right in drag polars, further from the experimental data at lower lift conditions, good agreement near the design CL, and slight improvement at the higher lift conditions."

In this study, we show that the above episodes of extraordinary warmth reflect to a large extent the unusual persistence and large amplitude of three well-known modes of atmospheric variability: the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific–North American (PNA) pattern. We employ a “replay” approach in which simulations with the NASA GEOS AGCM are constrained to remain close to MERRA-2 over specified regions of the globe in order to identify the underlying forcings and regions that acted to maintain these modes well beyond their typical submonthly time scales. 

We show that an extreme positive AO played a major role in the surface warming over Eurasia, with forcing from the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions acting to maintain its positive phase. Forcing from the tropical Indian Ocean and Atlantic regions produced positive NAO-like responses, contributing to the warming over eastern North America and Europe. The strong heat wave that developed over eastern North America during March was primarily associated with an extreme negative PNA that developed as an instability of the North Pacific jet, with tropical forcing providing support for a prolonged negative phase. A diagnosis of the zonally symmetric circulation shows that the above extratropical surface warming occurred underneath a deep layer of tropospheric warming, driven by stationary eddy-induced changes in the mean meridional circulation."

Mechanical changes to the cell structure represent an additional measure of the battery’s state because these changes are related to the overall battery health. As lithium-ion batteries are charged and discharged, lithium ions are inserted or removed from the anode and cathode, a process called intercalation and de-intercalation. As lithium ions intercalate and de-intercalate, they can cause changes to the lattice of the electrode particles, resulting in volumetric changes. These volumetric changes cause mechanical stresses and strains on the lithium-ion battery electrodes, and subsequently, the whole cell’s thickness varies as it is charged and discharged. This paper presents a study on the use of surface-mounted strain gauges for in-situ measurement of structural changes to lithium-ion batteries, along with  a characterization of the unit-to-unit differences in strain response. A neural network modeling structure is then used to predict the battery’s depth of discharge under dynamic discharge conditions."

Consistent with previous studies, extreme sea ice loss events are associated with moisture intrusions over the Barents-Kara Sea, which are driven by the large-scale atmospheric circulation. In addition to the role of downward longwave radiation associated with moisture intrusions, which is emphasized by previous studies, our analysis shows strong turbulent heat fluxes are associated with extreme sea ice melting events, with both turbulent sensible and latent heat fluxes contributing, though turbulent sensible heat fluxes dominate.

Our analysis also shows that these events are connected to tropical convective anomalies. A dipole pattern of convective anomalies with enhanced convection over the Maritime Continent and suppressed convection over the central to eastern Pacific is consistently detected about 6 to 10 days prior to extreme sea ice loss events. This pattern is associated with either the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) or El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Composites show that extreme sea ice loss events are connected to tropical convection via Rossby wave propagation in the midlatitudes. However, tropical convective anomalies alone are not sufficient to trigger extreme sea ice loss events, suggesting that extratropical variability likely modulates the connection between tropical convection and extreme sea ice loss events."

The Russian model can be derived from the power expression for slow crack growth (SCG) or “static fatigue.”  The US uses both power and exponential models.  Despite the similarity of models and data fitting approach (linear regression and right censoring), different SCG parameters have been derived by US and Russian parties for the same material (Russian fused silica) tested in a similar manner.  The difference appears to be related to the use of short-term strength data along with the longer-term static fatigue data, with the power law parameter n being very sensitive to the conversion of strength data into equivalent static data.  This hybrid approach is feasible if strength data is measured with a constant stress rate and is appropriately converted to a static equivalent.  More research into the approach is needed.  However, because of the nonlinear behavior of fused silica in log(v) – log(K(I) ) space and the sensitivity of parameter estimation to fit range, the exponential model is a better choice regardless of test method.  Functions are given to convert parameters from the Russian model to those in the US model.  However, accurate conversion is hampered by the lack of inert strength data. When the same test technique is used, US and Russian materials exhibit very similar parameters."

The hydrological functioning of tropical peatlands differs from that of northern peatlands, which has not yet been accounted for in global land surface models (LSMs). Here, we integrated tropical peat-specific hydrology modules into a global LSM for the first time, by utilizing the peatland-specific model structure adaptation (PEATCLSM) of the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM). We developed literature-based parameter sets for natural (PEATCLSM(Trop,Nat)) and drained (PEATCLSM(Trop,Drain)) tropical peatlands. Simulations with PEATCLSM(Trop,Nat) were compared against those with the default CLSM version and the northern version of PEATCLSM (PEATCLSM(North,Nat)) with tropical vegetation input. All simulations were forced with global meteorological reanalysis input data for the major tropical peatland regions in Central and South America, the Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia. The evaluation against a unique and extensive data set of in situ water level and eddy covariance-derived evapotranspiration showed an overall improvement in bias and correlation compared to the default CLSM version. Over Southeast Asia, an additional simulation with PEATCLSM(Trop,Drain) was run to address the large fraction of drained tropical peatlands in this region. PEATCLSM(Trop,Drain) outperformed CLSM, PEATCLSM(North,Nat) and PEATCLSM(Trop,Nat) over drained sites. Despite the overall improvements of PEATCLSM(Trop,Nat) over CLSM, there are strong differences in performance between the three study regions. We attribute these performance differences to regional differences in accuracy of meteorological forcing data, and differences in peatland hydrologic response that are not yet captured by our model."

The results show that microwave radiances have a large impact in the Southern Hemisphere and Tropical ocean, but the large influence is mostly observed above 925 hPa and dissipates relatively quickly with longer forecast lead times. Conventional data information holds better in the forecast ranging from the surface to 100 hPa, depending on the field evaluated, in the Northern Hemisphere and lowest model levels in the Tropics. Infrared radiances collectively have much less impact in the lower troposphere. Removing surface observations has small but persistent impact on specific humidity in the upper atmosphere, but small or negligible impact on planetary boundary layer (PBL) height and temperature. The model responses to the incremental analysis update (IAU) forcing are also analyzed. In the IAU assimilation window, the physics responds strongly to the IAU forcing in the lower troposphere, and the changes of physics tendency in the lower troposphere and hydrodynamics tendency in the mid- and upper troposphere are viewed as beneficial to the reduction of state error covariance. In the subsequent forecast, the model tendencies continue to deviate further from the original free forecast with forecast lead times around 300–400 hPa, but physics tendency has showed signs of returning to its original free forecast mechanisms at 1-day forecast in the lower troposphere."

Their interactions with radiation may result in either a warming or a cooling of the Earth system and generate diverse climate feedbacks. The vertical structure of the radiative effects of clouds as well as the response of clouds to global warming (i.e., the cloud feedbacks) are inadequately constrained within the diversity of current climate models, which limits our ability to project the magnitude of future warming. In this chapter we show how relatively recent active-sensor spaceborne observations have narrowed constraints on cloud feedbacks. The value added beyond what can be retrieved from passive sensors is only just beginning to be exploited."

The world’s space agencies and their missions were not immune to the wide-sweeping changes.  One discipline principally affected was mission operations and the various groups supporting that function.  Mission support teams, especially for complex and crewed missions like the International Space Station (ISS) were forced to rethink how and where control center staff performed their vital work.  Operations training – an essential element to mission ops, had unique hurdles to overcome.
Operations training is responsible for preparing astronaut crews for their missions, training and certifying flight controllers, as well as ensuring that new team members are ready to join their colleagues.  Every element of training was impacted during the pandemic.  From orientation and introductory classes for new controllers, simulations, and advanced lessons, On the Job Training (OJT) and final evaluations; all aspects faced challenges.  Trainers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama were forced to become more efficient with trainees and resources to continue supporting ISS payload operations.
The pandemic arrived in the USA in March 2020.  Immediately, NASA mandated that the support for ISS real-time operations was critical.  As a result, physical access to key facilities was restricted.  Trainers and trainees had to quickly shift to 100% remote learning.  In the short term, this was not a problem.  However, instructors discovered lessons they were accustomed to delivering in a classroom environment often did not translate to remote teaching.  Another hurdle to operations training was the mandate that all simulations could only be held remotely.  The logistics of even small simulations proved to be challenging due to Information Technology (IT) restrictions and public internet limitations.  With simulations essentially halted, as well as the restrictions on most OJT, trainees were essentially stopped in their advancement towards certification.
Once limitations were identified, trainers prioritized new options.  Transitioning to all electronic learning materials was a relatively easy fix.  Teaching to large groups took additional shifts in the training paradigm.  Methods for preparing astronauts for their missions were revised.  Simulation supervisors found efficient techniques to provide realistic training experiences.  Communication and coordination with management was essential.  In every case, the payload operations instructors found novel solutions to all functions listed.  This paper discusses the factors and solutions payloads operations trainers found to keep scientific research on the ISS flying forward to mission success."

To do this, the GEOS Earth system model is coupled with the GEOS-Chem tropospheric-stratospheric unified chemistry extension (UCX) to represent composition from the surface to the top of the GEOS atmosphere (0.01 hPa). The GEOS-CF system is described, including updates made to the GEOS-Chem UCX mechanism within GEOS-CF for improved representation of stratospheric chemistry. Comparisons are made against balloon, lidar and satellite observations for stratospheric composition, including measurements of ozone (O3) and important nitrogen and chlorine species related to stratospheric O3recovery. The GEOS-CF nudges the stratospheric O3towards the GEOS Forward Processing (GEOS FP) assimilated O3product; as a result the stratospheric O3in the GEOS-CF historical estimate agrees well with observations. During abnormal dynamical and chemical environments such as the 2020 polar vortexes, the GEOS-CF O3forecasts are more realistic than GEOS FP O3forecasts because of the inclusion of the complex GEOS-Chem UCX stratospheric chemistry. Overall, the spatial patterns of the GEOS-CF simulated concentrations of stratospheric composition agree well with satellite observations. However, there are notable biases – such as low NOx and HNO3 in the polar regions and generally low HCl throughout the stratosphere – and future improvements to the chemistry mechanism and emissions are discussed. GEOS-CF is a new tool for the research community and instrument teams observing trace gases in the stratosphere and troposphere, providing near-real-time three-dimensional gridded information on atmospheric composition."

Human exposure data to dynamic loads in spaceflight are sparse not only because very few crewmembers have flown in space, but also because much of the historic data is no longer readily available. Earth and Moon landings of the Apollo missions are unique and valuable for understanding human tolerance in water landing conditions for both short-duration and long-duration crewmembers as well as informing crew tolerance in standing postures during planetary landings. The goal of this task was to find relevant Apollo data to better understand human tolerance in these scenarios, in order to apply this knowledge to future missions.

METHODS
The goal of this task was to recover time history data from dynamic phases of flight from crewed Apollo missions. The first phase of the task was to search available records at JSC and other centers to locate the appropriate records at the National Archives in Fort Worth, TX. Once the possible data locations were located, it was planned that one researcher would travel to the National Archives in Fort Worth, TX to collect the relevant Apollo data. 

Once the data was retrieved, they would be digitized for future use and evaluation, and archived within the Human Physiology, Performance, Protection, and Operations (H-3PO) laboratory within the Human Health and Performance Directorate. These data would be used to assess the feasibility and acceptability of current standards and vehicle design requirements for lunar and Mars missions. Additionally, any medical monitoring required, or physiological changes noted in crewmembers based on dynamic loads would be documented for future use. 

RESULTS 
Relevant records were found at Ft. Worth, TX and College Park, MD using the National Archives Online Catalog. In addition to the online catalog, an Archives staff member was able to share an additional inventory list of NASA JSC records held in Ft. Worth, TX. Due to COVID-19, NASA has only recently allowed non-mission essential travel. In addition, the National Archives has also been closed to the public since March 2020. Because of this, travel to the National Archives to search records there has not been possible. 

CONCLUSION
The findings include collections at the National Archives at both Ft. Worth, TX and College Park, MD that could possibly hold the data we are looking for. Unfortunately, the descriptions of each collection are very broad. Though we are hopeful that relevant data is stored in one of these collections, we cannot be sure that we will find what we are looking for. At this time, it is not clear when the Archives will reopen to the public or when NASA will allow travel. Travel to the Archives has been postponed, and will be reassessed at a future date."

The performance testing of the SDR is discussed via a comprehensive S-band and communication link analysis. The tested capabilities of the SDR and antenna components are reviewed in terms of the mission requirements for each CubeSat. Size Weight and Power (SWaP), required availability, and access times are discussed. The measured data from experimental compatibility testing is incorporated into detailed simulations of the CubeSat mission set to verify desired performance over the mission lifetime. The model is also used to investigate the impact of potential adverse effects on the communication links such as interference and weather conditions. 

This paper also reviews potential improvements from future technological advances and commercial partnerships. A collaborative investigation between GSFC and Oklahoma State University is presented in which a qualitative analysis of Hybrid RF/Optical communication strategies is performed. The data rate improvements of optical communication techniques are weighed against attitude control and science mission requirements for CubeSats, and network architectures/switching strategies are discussed. A separate analysis reviews the potential benefits of ground station partnerships, which aligns with NASA’s future goal to include commercial partners in its Earth and space network architectures, e.g. LunaNet."

This division developed as a way to place life scientists alongside experts in the physical constraints that define the acclimation, adaptation and evolution of biology systems relevant to their respective subjects. For astrobiology, integration with disciplines such as geology, geochemistry, astronomy, planetary science, etc., enables a comprehensive  assessment  of  the  physical  environment  and  its  co-evolution  with  biological processes. Space Biology’s co-location with Physical Sciences places life science researchers adjacent to experts in the physical phenomena associated with microgravity and spaceflight, enabling an understanding of how the spaceflight environment affects biological systems.  Despite this separation, aspects of both disciplines have converged on a similar, fundamental objective: to describe and understand the dynamics of complex living communities in the contexts of their physical environments. While the environmental systems and timescales are dramatically different, continuing to motivate the separation into distinct fields, similarities in the underlying objective present opportunities to find efficiencies, reduce overlap, and minimize duplication of effort. Space Biology and Astrobiology share a common need to understand microbial physiology in extreme environments – whether the ‘built’ spaceflight environment or the natural environments in which many astrobiology studies are conducted.  In particular, open questions in each discipline require the development of quantitative frameworks, applicable at the ecosystem level, that support predictive capabilities for environments where observations are sparse. Additionally, both disciplines have a need to prepare, detect, and analyze the (potential) biological signal in complex samples-often in a completely autonomous fashion. The next decade will see NASA Space Biology moving to understand and describe the effects of the beyond low-earth orbit (BLEO) spaceflight environment on living systems. This new direction will dramatically reduce the  opportunities  for  ground-based  analysis  of  space-flown  samples,  driving  space  biology investigations towards fully autonomous experiments and missions. At the same time, astrobiology life detection missions aimed at detecting biosignatures on Mars and icy moons in the outer solar system could benefit from fully automated sample processing and analysis. There are opportunities to leverage instrument and method development between both disciplines within the context of these BLEO missions."

CTA8.2 was an 8-foot diameter honeycomb-core sandwich cylinder that was fabricated and tested at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The primary objectives of this test were to interrogate the structural capability of the composite test article, and to verify the test-article design and analysis approach for cylinders subjected to axial compression loads. This report contains the descriptions of the test-article design, fabrication, and test. The pre-test modeling and analysis methods, and corresponding results used in support of the test-article design and test planning, are also described.

Using NASA’s retrospective S2S ensemble forecast in conjunction with a terrestrial biosphere model, and using an independent, remote sensing-based dataset for validation, we demonstrate an ability to accurately forecast spring-summer carbon uptake at multi-month  leads. Averaged across mid-and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere land, the GPP forecast initialized on January 1 produces statistically significant skill through summer. The skill achieved, however, is spatially variable, with  some  regions appearing to extract skill from accurate forecasts of snowpack removal and others extracting skill from the initialization of carbon and nitrogen states. Our results reveal some heretofore unexplored facets of climate predictability and provide a look at what might be possible with future S2S forecast systems that are fully integrated with biogeochemical cycles."

An example is presented to illustrate the use of the intent conflict probability in strategic planning applications."

The UTM architecture was used to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of safe, efficient, and scalable small UAS operations in low altitudes below 400 feet above ground level. Following the success and adoption of UTM architecture, the foundational UTM requirements and core properties were generalized to become Extensible Traffic Management (xTM) requirements to support operations of new entrants beyond small UAS, such as operations in high altitudes over 60,000 feet, designated as upper Class E in the United States National Airspace System (NAS). In this paper, the generalization of UTM to xTM and NASA’s approach for developing an xTM system for upper Class E Traffic Management (ETM) are discussed. The paper also discusses the planned research to examine the potential xTM-Air Traffic Control (ATC) interactions across multiple xTM systems and identify common coordination procedures, ATC roles/responsibilities, and data exchange requirements. This work is one of the steps for improving interoperability between the xTM systems and ATS, which is critical for safe and efficient sharing of the airspace among the new entrants served by the xTM systems and conventional ATS-serviced operations."

The current state-of-the-art methods approved for automated approach and landing will be difficult to utilize in support of AAM operational concepts. However, there are technology and systems from other applications and lower-TRL research that use vision, IR, radar, and GPS methods to provide baseline perception and sensing requirements for AAM aircraft approach and landing. This paper focuses on vision-based PAL to demonstrate a closed-loop baseline controller while adhering to the Federal Aviation Administration requirements and regulations. The coplanar algorithm determines pose estimation, which feeds into an Extended Kalman filter. Combining IMU with vision creates a sensor fusion navigation solution for GPS-denied environments. The state estimate leads to glideslope and localizer error computations, which will be pertinent for designing and deriving guidance laws and control laws for AAM PALS. The IMU and vision navigation solution provides promising simulation results for AAM PALS, and higher fidelity simulations will include computer graphics rendering and feature correspondence."

This spacesuit is underdevelopment to support missions to the International Space Station (ISS) and also to the Moon.  The xEMU uses controlled evaporative cooling through a membrane to reject waste heat from the crewmember, avionics, and environmental in-leak during autonomous operation.  Given the unique mass and volume constraints imposed by the spacesuit application and the opportunities presented by the selection of a given membrane, the xEMU does not possess a separate feedwater loop to feed the evaporation process, rather the feedwater for the evaporation process is fed directly from the transport loop which collects heat from the sources within the suit.  This has many benefits including mass/volume reductions from a lower component count within the system but does pose some additional potential constraints on water quality within the system in order to provide a working fluid that can be pumped, filtered, and used in contact with the remainder of the system while both avoiding fouling of the membrane as well as other deleterious effects such as creating conditions for corrosion of wetted surfaces within the transport loop.  The discussion will seek to address the main sources of contamination and the applied controls.  Sources considered will include: self-generated via materials selection and processes applied, influent working fluid, contamination of the influent working fluid via Ground Support Equipment (GSE) or processing equipment, microbial activity, and environmental influences such as elevated ambient CO2."

The xEMU has been detailed with respect to completing a demonstration on the International Space Station (ISS) with support of units for initial lunar capability.  The xEMU completed the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) with subsequent Safety Review Panel (SRP) Phase I reviews in 2019-2020.  The objectives for DVT are to validate requirements, train the team, learn how to fabricate the hardware with appropriate process controls, assemble the hardware, test the hardware, determine the failure mechanisms/limits of the hardware design and buy down the most risk possible for the qualification and flight phases of the development.  With completion of the assembly and initial functional testing of the DVT PLSS in laboratory ambient conditions and vacuum conditions the xEMU has progressed significantly into the DVT objectives.  A key part of the test sequences for DVT and all future phases is the Pre-Installation Acceptance (PIA) functional testing which validates the performance of integrated systems including: primary thermal control, auxiliary thermal control, suit ventilation, primary oxygen, secondary oxygen, power distribution, as well as caution and warning all with respect to the applied requirements.  This discussion will include an overview of the assembly, summary of the PIA functional testing, lessons learned, and corrective actions implemented moving forward into the remainder of the DVT phase for xEMU."

Since that time, the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) architecture has been demonstrated at bread-board level, packaged prototype level with Human In-The Loop (HITL) testing, and has now matured into what has become known as the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) PLSS focused on a demonstration on the International Space Station (ISS) and support for initial lunar missions.

This may be done by assessing the accuracy of predictions against validation data and understanding the source of any inaccuracies. LES is a promising approach for capturing the laminar/turbulent transition process in a LPT. In previous studies, the authors utilized LES to model the flow field over a Variable Speed Power Turbine (VSPT) blade and successfully captured characteristic features of separation/reattachment and transition on the suction side at both the cruise (positive incidence) and take-off conditions (negative incidence) and as well, simulated the effect of free-stream turbulence (FST) on those phenomena. The predicted pressure loading profiles agreed well with the experimental data for both a high and a low FST case at a Reynolds number of Re(ex)=220,000. In this paper, we present wake profiles resulting from computations for a range of FST values. Although the predicted wake profiles for the  lowest  FST  case  (Tu=0.5%)  matched  the  experimental  data,  at  higher  FST  (Tu=10-15%,)  the  wake  was  wider  than  the experimentally measured wake and for both cases were displaced laterally when compared to the experimental measurements.    In our investigation of the causes of the said discrepancies we have identified important effects which could strongly influence the predicted wake profile. Predicted losses were improved by assuring the validity of the flow solution. This was done by utilizing spectral analysis to scrutinize the dynamic behavior of the wake and determine solution accuracy resulting from low mesh density and low accuracy of convective modeling."

multiple methods of measuring energy absorption to fully characterize the dynamic crush response of composite components. Objective: The main goal of the current investigation was to demonstrate functionality, repeatability, and accuracy of crush testing using a crash sled with a translating support mass. Methods: A semi-automated algorithm for data reduction was developed based on impact mechanics principles. A preliminary set of tests was initially conducted using aluminum honeycomb specimens with a specified stable crushing force to quantify the accuracy and repeatability of the crush data. Following the success of these tests, triaxially-braided fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) specimens were evaluated. Results: Crush tests with the aluminum honeycomb specimens showed
excellent outcomes for all three specimens. These data provided close agreement with cumulative energy absorption between individual instruments and stable crushing forces at expected values. For the FRP specimens, specific energy absorption (SEA) and force-displacement curves were successfully measured; however, data from the translating support mass accelerometer was excluded from the dataset due to clipping. The SEA of the corrugated specimens was greater than the SEA for the C-channel specimens at both test speeds. Conclusions: The crash sled functionality was verified, the specimen geometry was found to contribute more to SEA than the impact speed in the speed range tested, and the support mass accelerometer will be upgraded to prevent clipping in future tests."

This mission will enable unprecedented interdisciplinary science and applications relevant to studying the biology and geology of the Earth's surface. Measurement targets are directly aligned for studying coastal and inland waters ecosystems and water quality, including coralreef ecosystems, snow and ice, mineralogy, volcanology, biology, ecology, biodiversity, and components of radiative forcing from the surface such as greenhouse gas emissions. The observations not only have scientific value in studying feedbacks and interactions of surface processes (e.g., harmful algal blooms, domoic acid, oil spills, and other hazardous events), but also societal benefit – with the capacity to support real-world decision-making such as response to theseevents and inland water conservation, protection of drinking water quality for public and environmental health, and habitat conservation. The work presented here outlines the conducted mission and architecture study and the initiation of science performance trades (signal sensitivity; spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution; and atmospheric effects) informing the design of the SBG segment of the ESO providing the most value to myriad science and applications as possible. Science and applications synergies and algorithms with the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) and the Geostationary Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer (GLIMR) is opportunistic for advancing aquatics research and applications."

Precipitation systems consist of a broad spectrum of three-dimensional structures in which microphysical processes interact with macro-scale processes in the cloud system and the ambient environment that prescribe the evolution of the system. Since 1970s, satellite observations of precipitation have been a fundamental tool in quantifying this complex interaction. They have first quantified the frequency and intensity of global precipitation, including remote areas over open oceans and polar regions, thus providing today’s precipitation climatology. More recently, satellite observations of cloud and precipitation have been exploited for understanding the physical mechanisms governing precipitation systems. A subset of these studies also provided observation-based metrics to probe physical processes operating in cloud-precipitation systems and to apply them as diagnostic measures for evaluating the representation of the processes in numerical models for better projections of future climate.  In this chapter, we first review the theoretical basis of precipitation remote sensing from space and describe how it is practically applied in satellite missions. In the first part of the chapter, an historical overview of the satellite missions is described, summarising the instruments and retrieval algorithms developed in the missions. In the second part, we introduce a set of studies discussing the fundamental mechanisms behind precipitation formation, highlighting what we have learnt to date on cloud-precipitation processes from satellite observations."

Western Montana’s rivers possess great economic and ecological value, yet the status of contaminants in these systems can be unclear. Contaminants such as brominated flame-retardants, heavy metals, and pharmaceuticals negatively affect ecosystem health by traveling through the food chain and bioaccumulating in apex predators. Exposure to these contaminants can result in neurological, endocrine, and reproductive impairments in wildlife and humans. American mink (Neovison vison) and North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) have a predominantly aquatic diet and serve as reliable indicator species of environmental health. Working Dogs for Conservation (WD4C) uses detection dogs to locate scat samples of these species which are assessed for contaminants by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS). With Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM), the team generated current (2013-2020) and projected (2021-2040) habitat suitability models for mink and otter utilizing NASA Earth observations from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (GPM IMERG), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). The habitat suitability maps’ study region encompassed Flathead National Forest and Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Additionally, the team created site accessibility and precipitation anomaly maps that display the viability of survey locations. The current habitat suitability models performed well (AUC-PR=0.88). The most important predictor variables for suitable habitat were distance to rivers, elevation, and land cover. These end products will further inform WD4C survey site selection and contaminant monitoring."

Many neural network encoder architectures, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet, were trained on over 100,000 labelled microscopy images from 54 classes. These pre-trained encoders were then embedded into multiple segmentation architectures including U-Net and DeepLabV3+ to evaluate segmentation performance on newly created benchmark microscopy datasets. Compared to ImageNet pre-training, models pre-trained on MicroNet generalized better to out-of-distribution micrographs taken under different imaging and sample conditions and were more accurate with less training data. When training with only a single Ni-superalloy image, pre-training on MicroNet produced a 72.2 percent reduction in relative segmentation error. These results suggest that transfer learning from large in-domain datasets generate models with learned feature representations that are more useful for downstream tasks and will likely improve any microscopy image analysis technique that can leverage pre-trained encoders."

This challenge represented a significant departure from previous approaches that minimized Earth-launched mass and maximized in-space transportation efficiency, often resulting in roundtrip missions of three years or more in duration. In the interest of crew health, MAT’s cross-Agency team of subject matter experts was challenged to develop an architecture capable of shortening crew time away from Earth to about two years. MAT was given specific mission constraints, such as number of crew, as well as mandates to minimize surface infrastructure as much as possible and to incorporate nuclear transportation options. The resulting MAT-developed concept, referred to here as the Strategic Analysis Cycle 2021 (SAC21) architecture, leverages Artemis elements and emerging commercial capabilities for cargo and logistics launches, and features a hybrid Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP)/Chemical transportation system able to complete the 1.8 billion kilometer round-trip journey to Mars and back in 760 to 850 days transit time for the 2039 Earth departure opportunity. Three Mars Descent Systems (MDS), each capable of landing about 25 metric tons of useful cargo on the surface of Mars, would be pre-deployed in advance of crew departure from Earth; two of these MDS’s would deliver a partially fueled Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), a fission power system, surface mobility, and additional MAV propellant. To minimize surface infrastructure, only two of the four Mars crew would descend and live in an MDS-landed pressurized rover, exploring the martian surface for 30 martian days, or sols, before returning to Mars orbit aboard their MAV and rejoining the other two crew on the Deep Space Transport for the Earth return voyage. Specifics of many of these architecture elements are detailed in separate technical publications; this paper outlines the end-to-end integrated architecture performance and concept of operations, including synergies with Artemis lunar architecture elements. It is important to note that NASA does not have a formal human Mars program and no decisions have been made; the architecture described here is intended to fill in an often-overlooked corner of the trade space, helping to complete the menu of options available to decision-makers as they chart the course for humans to Mars."

A key challenge to understanding and predicting rainfall triggered landslides comes from observational uncertainties in the depth and intensity of precipitation preceding the event. Practitioners and researchers must select among a wide range of precipitation products, often with little guidance. Here we evaluate the degree of precipitation uncertainty across multiple precipitation products for a large set of landslide triggering storm events and investigate the impact of these uncertainties on predicted landslide probability using published intensity-duration thresholds. The average intensity, peak intensity, duration, and NOAA-Atlas return periods are compared ahead of reported landslides across the continental US and Canada. Precipitation data are taken from four products that cover disparate measurement methods: near real-time and post-processed satellite (IMERG), radar (MRMS), and gauge-based (NLDAS-2). Landslide-triggering precipitation was found to vary widely across precipitation products with the depth of individual storm events diverging by as much as 296mm with an average range of 51mm. Peak intensity measurements, which are typically influential in triggering landslides, were also highly variable with an average range of 7.8262745mm/hr and as much as 57mm/hr. The two products more reliant upon ground-based observations (MRMS and NLDAS-2) performed better at identifying landslides according to published intensity duration storm thresholds, but all products exhibited hit-ratios of greater than 0.56. A greater proportion of landslides were predicted when including only manually-verified landslide locations. We recommend practitioners consider low-latency products like MRMS for investigating landslides, given their near-real time data availability and good performance in detecting landslides. Practitioners would be well-served considering more than one product as a way to confirm intense storm signals and minimize the influence of noise and false alarms."

Different from past studies that use column integrated aerosol optical thickness, here only near-surface CALIOP aerosol extinction is used for deriving near-surface PM with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) concentrations using an innovative, bulk-mass-modeling-based method.  Compared against ground based PM2.5 measurements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an encouraging relationship between CALIOP-derived PM2.5 and EPA-observed PM2.5 (Deming slope = 0.89; RMSE = 3.42 µg/m3; mean bias = -1.00 µg/m3) is found using combined daytime/nighttime CALIOP data.  Also, comparable trends in PM2.5 concentrations from the EPA and daytime and nighttime CALIOP data are found for most of the eastern CONUS and imply that air quality is generally improving over this region for the study period.  Over the western CONUS, a seasonal analysis reveals that PM2.5 trends are positive during the more active wildfire season (June through November) but negative for other months.  This study suggests that lidar data show promise in their use for obtaining PM2.5 estimates and provides motivation to further explore aerosol extinction-based PM concentration retrievals in anticipation of future space-based lidar missions."

SAR improved the identification and quantification of damaged corn and soybeans, as compared to true-color composites and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A statistical approach to identify damaged corn and soybean crops from SAR was created with estimates of 1.97 million acres of damaged corn and 1.40 million acres of damaged soybeans in the state of Iowa. The damage estimates generated by this study were comparable to estimates produced by others after the derecho, including two commercial agricultural companies."

Biological polymers tend toward homochiral systems, which favor the incorporation of a single enantiomer (molecules with a specific chiral configuration) over the other. There have been numerous investigations into the processes that preferentially enrich one enantiomer to understand the evolution of an early, racemic, prebiotic organic world. Chirality can also be a property of minerals; their interaction with chiral organics is important for assessing how post-depositional alteration processes could affect the stereochemical configuration of simple and complex organic molecules. In this paper, we review the properties of organic compounds and minerals as well as the physical, chemical, and geological processes that affect organic and mineral chirality during the preservation and detection of organic compounds. We provide perspectives and discussions on the reactions and analytical techniques that can be performed in the laboratory, and comment on the state of knowledge of flight-capable technologies in current and future planetary missions, with a focus on organics analysis and life detection."

SO will initially observe CMB by using three small aperture telescopes and one large-aperture telescope. While polarization maps from small-aperture telescopes will be used to constrain inflationary gravitational waves, the internal CMB lensing maps used to delens will be reconstructed from data from the large-aperture telescope. Since lensing maps obtained from the SO data will be noise dominated on subdegree scales, the SO lensing framework constructs a template for lensing-induced B modes by combining internal CMB lensing maps with maps of the cosmic infrared background from Planck as well as galaxy density maps from the LSST survey. We construct a likelihood for constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio r  that contains auto and cross spectra between observed B modes and the lensing B-mode template. We test our delensing analysis pipeline on map-based simulations containing survey nonidealities, but that, for this initial exploration, does not include contamination from Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. We find that the SO survey masking and inhomogeneous and atmospheric noise have very little impact on the delensing performance, and the r constraint becomes σ(r)≈0.0015 which is close to that obtained from the idealized forecasts in the absence of the Galactic foreground and is nearly a factor of 2 tighter than without delensing. We also find that uncertainties in the external large-scale structure tracers used in our multitracer delensing pipeline lead to bias much smaller than the 1σ  statistical uncertainties."

The principal tasks are to design (or size) a rotorcraft to meet specified requirements, including vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) operation, and then analyze the performance of the aircraft for a set of conditions. For broad and lasting utility, it is important that the code have the capability to model general rotorcraft configurations, and estimate the performance and weights of advanced rotor concepts. The architecture of the NDARC code accommodates configuration flexibility, a hierarchy of models, and ultimately multidisciplinary design, analysis, and optimization. Initially the software is implemented with low-fidelity models, typically appropriate for the conceptual design environment.

An NDARC job consists of one or more cases, each case optionally performing design and analysis tasks. The design task involves sizing the rotorcraft to satisfy specified design conditions and missions. The analysis tasks can include off-design mission performance calculation, flight performance calculation for point operating conditions, and generation of subsystem or component performance maps. For analysis tasks, the aircraft description can come from the sizing task, from a previous case or a previous NDARC job, or be independently generated (typically the description of an existing aircraft). 

The aircraft consists of a set of components, including fuselage, rotors, wings, tails, and propulsion. For each component, attributes such as performance, drag, and weight can be calculated; and the aircraft attributes are obtained from the sum of the component attributes. Description and analysis of conventional rotorcraft configurations is facilitated, while retaining the capability to model novel and advanced concepts. Specific rotorcraft configurations considered are single-main-rotor and tail-rotor helicopter, tandem helicopter, coaxial helicopter, and tiltrotor. The architecture of the code accommodates addition of new or higher-fidelity attribute models for a component, as well as addition of new components."

Tracking and predicting the spread of vector-borne diseases is a vital task that could save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Oftentimes, the first reports of vector-borne disease outbreaks occur through emails and online reporting systems long before they are officially documented. Tracking and predicting the emergence and spread of vector-borne disease outbreaks requires extracting data from these unstructured sources in combination with historical weather and climate data to understand the underlying background triggers and disease dynamics. In this work, we develop a data extraction pipeline for the online outbreak reporting website ProMED-mail that utilizes a web scraper, transformer neural network summarizer, and named entity recognizer to obtain a dataset of malaria, dengue, zika, and chikungunya outbreaks over the last 30 years. This scraped dataset was further analyzed in association with global rainfall anomalies derived from NASA’s Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM [Global Precipitation Mission] (IMERG) dataset. This preliminary analysis was to understand the effect of global rainfall patterns on the spread of vector-borne diseases. Analysis of the ProMED-mail and GPM data shows that vector-borne disease outbreaks are clustered towards the tropics and outbreaks are often amplified during the rainy seasons. Our scraped dataset can be a valuable tool in creating comprehensive georeferenced disease records for modeling and predicting future outbreaks."

Furthermore, the risk of heat-related illnesses and mortality disproportionately affects neighborhoods in Yonkers historically subjected to race-based housing segregation. To better understand these inequities, Groundwork Hudson Valley and NASA DEVELOP collaborated for a second term to evaluate community-level heat vulnerability, landcover distribution, street-level thermal comfort, and modeled urban cooling interventions. This team applied 2019 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data and social and biophysical heat vulnerability variables established by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), along with land surface temperature (LST) data collected from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), and ISS ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) to identify communities in Yonkers in need of prioritized cooling intervention at the census tract level. Data from the Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis (RTMA) provided relevant meteorological data for the ENVI-met model to conduct street-level thermal observations and model tree canopy cooling interventions in the Yonkers neighborhoods of Kimball and Old 7th Ward. The project results will support the prioritization and equitable distribution of cooling infrastructure in identified neighborhoods. Additionally, Groundwork Hudson Valley will use the analyses as a heat literacy tool to improve advocacy efforts and inform both residents and officials about how investment in deliberate modification to tree canopy cover improves the city’s thermal environment and helps mitigate extreme heat."

Previous studies have suggested that ocean-atmosphere coupling plays a key role in this intensification, but the precise role of the different components of the coupling has not been explored and quantified. In this paper, using a hierarchy of ocean coupling experiments, we isolate and quantify the respective roles of thermodynamic (changes in surface heat fluxes) and dynamic (changes in ocean heat flux convergence) ocean coupling in the projected intensification of North Atlantic transient eddy kinetic energy (TEKE). We show that dynamic coupling accounts for nearly all of the future TEKE strengthening as it overcomes the much smaller effect of surface heat flux changes to weaken the TEKE. We further show that by reducing the Arctic amplification in the North Atlantic, ocean heat flux convergence increases the meridional temperature gradient aloft, causing a larger eddy growth rate, and resulting in the strengthening of North Atlantic TEKE. Our results stress the importance of better monitoring and investigating the changes in ocean heat transport, for improving climate change adaptation strategies."

The adaptive routines consist of real-time state estimators combined with battery parameter model components that are adjusted in real-time as battery data becomes available. Several aspects are explored. It is shown that model parameter identification is possible for simple battery models using available input/output data measurements. The online system identification used is recursive least squares. Model identification may be combined with a state observer such as the extended Kalman filter or the unscented Kalman filter to form an adaptive model combined with state estimation. However, such a combination is found to be problematic due to uncertainty, observability and stability issues. This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces adaptive routines and possible roles they play in battery modeling. In Section 2 real-time parameter identification is described with results based on battery data. Section 3 reviews various state estimators and results using a simple battery model. In Section 4 parameter identification and state estimation are combined to form an adaptive routine.

This study analyses at least 1 year of asynchronous particle number size distributions from six different locations in India. We also analyze the frequency of NPF and its contribution to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. We found that the NPF frequency has a considerable seasonal variability. At the measurement sites analyzed in this study, NPF frequently occurs in March–May (pre-monsoon, about 21 % of the days) and is the least common in October–November (post-monsoon, about 7 % of the days). Considering the NPF events in all locations, the particle formation rate (J_(SDS)) varied by more than 2 orders of magnitude (0.001–0.6 /cu.cm s) and the growth rate between the smallest detectable size and 25 nm (GR_(SDS-25 nm)) by about 3 orders of magnitude (0.2–17.2 nm/h). We found that JSDS was higher by nearly 1 order of magnitude during NPF events in urban areas than mountain sites. GRSDS did not show a systematic difference. Our results showed that NPF events could significantly modulate the shape of particle number size distributions and CCN concentrations in India. The contribution of a given NPF event to CCN concentrations was the highest in urban locations (4.3 × 10^(3) /cu.cm per event and 1.2 × 10^(3)/cu.cm per event for 50 and 100 nm, respectively) as compared to mountain background sites (2.7 × 10^(3)/cu.cm per event and 1.0 × 10^(3)/cu.cm per event, respectively). We emphasize that the physical and chemical pathways responsible for NPF and factors that control its contribution to CCN production require in situ field observations using recent advances in aerosol and its precursor gaseous measurement techniques."

An armouring regime, specific to rubble-pile surfaces, has been proposed to occur when an impactor is comparable in diameter to a target surface particle (for example, a boulder). Armouring is proposed to reduce crater diameter, or prevent crater formation in the asteroid surface, at small crater diameters. Here, using measurements of 1,560 craters on the rubble-pile asteroid (101955) Bennu, we show that the boulder population controls a transition from crater formation to armouring at crater diameters ~2–3 m, below which crater formation in the bulk surface is increasingly rare. By combining estimates of impactor flux with the armouring scaling relationship, we find that Bennu’s crater retention age (surface age derived from crater abundance) spans from 1.6–2.2 Myr for craters less than a few meters to ~10–65 Myr for craters >100 m in diameter, reducing the maximum surface age by a factor of >15 relative to previous estimates. The range of crater retention ages, together with latitudinal variations in large-crater spatial density, indicate that ongoing resurfacing processes render the surface many times younger than the bulk asteroid."

These galaxy candidates, selected after careful screening of foreground interlopers, have spectral energy distributions showing a sharp discontinuity around 1.7 μm, a flat continuum at 2–5 μm, and nondetections at <1.2 μm in the available photometric data sets, all of which are consistent with a z > 12 galaxy. An ALMA program targeting one of the candidates shows a tentative 4σ [O III] 88 μm line at z = 13.27, in agreement with its photometric redshift estimate. The number density of the z ∼ 12–13 candidates is comparable to that of bright z ∼ 10 galaxies and is consistent with a recently proposed double-power-law luminosity function rather than the Schechter function, indicating little evolution in the abundance of bright galaxies from z ∼ 4 to 13. Comparisons with theoretical models show that the models cannot reproduce the bright end of rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions at z ∼ 10–13. Combined with recent studies reporting similarly bright galaxies at z ∼ 9–11 and mature stellar populations at z ∼ 6–9, our results indicate the existence of a number of star-forming galaxies at z > 10, which will be detected with upcoming space missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and GREX-PLUS."

Theory is critical for understanding processes we observe in social-ecological systems because it points to a specific locus of attention for research, shapes research questions, guides quantitative model development, influences what researchers find, and ultimately informs policies and programs. Research into climate mobility has grown out of early studies on environmental migration, and has often developed in isolation from broader theoretical developments in the migration research community. As such, there is a risk that the work may be inadequately informed by the rich corpus of theory that has contributed to our understanding of who migrates; why they migrate; the types of mobility they employ; what sustains migration streams; and why they choose certain destinations over others. On the other hand, there are ways in which climate and broader environment migration research is enriching the conceptual frameworks being employed to understand migration, particularly forced migration. This paper draws on a review of 75 empirical studies and modeling efforts conducted by researchers from a diversity of disciplines, covering various regions, and using a variety of data sources and methods to assess how they used theory in their research. The goal is to suggest ways forward for engagement with migration theory in this large and growing research domain."

Interms of extraterrestrial applications, radiative cooling is a critical component to the thermalmanagement system of a spacecraft, where the extreme environment of space can cause largetemperature   variations   that   can   break   and   damage   equipment.   For   terrestrial   applications,nocturnal   or   daytime   radiative   cooling   is   expected   to   lead   to   cost-effective   passive   heatmanagement without the need of inefficient and costly artificial refrigeration technologies.However, most currently available radiative cooling systems cannot be changed dynamically andradiate a constant static amount of thermal power. Dynamically tunable adaptive radiativecooling systems will be a critical development to prolong the lifetime of spacecraft or improvethe efficiency of terrestrial cooling systems. Here we propose stretchable radiative coolingdesigns that can be substantially tuned by using the simple physical mechanism of mechanical strain. When their structure is stretched, the radiated power is significantly reduced. We developa modeling method that can simulate mechanical stretching combined with electromagnetic response to compute the tunable thermal emission of these new adaptive radiative coolingsystems. The presented photonically engineered structures can be used as coatings to achieveefficient adaptive thermal control of various objects in a cost-effective and environmentallyfriendly way. The proposed designs are much simpler to be realized than others found in theliterature and the best design achieves a high thermal emission power with a tunable range on theorder of 132 W/m2."

(LRI) measurements to sub-monthly time-variable gravity (TVG) signals caused by transient, high-frequency mass changes in the Earth system. GRACE-FO LRI provides complementary inter-satellite ranging measurements with higher precision over a wider range of frequencies than the baseline K-band microwave ranging system. The common approach for studying mass variation relies on the inverted TVG or mascon solutions over a period of, for example, one month or 10 days which are adversely affected by temporal aliasing and/or smoothing. In this article, we present the alternative along-orbit analysis methodology in terms of line-of-sight gravity difference (LGD) to fully exploit the higher precision LRI measurements for examination of sub-monthly mass changes. The discrepancy between “instantaneous” LGD LRI observations and monthly mean LGD (from Level-2 data) at satellite altitude indicates the sub-monthly gravitational variability not captured by monthly-mean solutions. In conjunction with the satellite ocean altimetry observations, high frequency non-tidal atmosphere and ocean models, and hydrology models, we show that the LGD LRI observations detect the high-frequency oceanic mass variability in the Argentine Basin and the Gulf of Carpentaria, and sub-monthly variations in surface (river) water in the Amazon Basin. We demonstrate the benefits gained from repeat ground track analysis of GRACE-FO LRI data in the case of the Amazon surface water flow. The along-orbit analysis methodology based on LGD LRI time series presented here is especially suitable for quantifying temporal and spatial evolution of extreme, rapidly changing mass variations."

Validation of these satellite products has often taken place under stratiform cloud conditions that favor the assumption of cloud horizontal homogeneity used by the retrieval techniques. However, many studies have noted concerns with respect to significant biases in retrieved Re arising from cloud heterogeneity, for example, in cumulus cloud fields. Here, we examine data collected during the 2019 “Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment” (CAMP2Ex), which, in part, targeted the objective of providing the first detailed evaluation of Re retrieved across multiple platforms and techniques in a cumulus and congestus cloud region. Our evaluation consists of cross-comparisons of Re between the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite, the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) onboard the NASA P-3 aircraft, and in situ measurements from both the NASA P-3 and Learjet aircraft that are all taken in close spatiotemporal proximity to the same cloud fields. A particular advantage of our approach lies in the capability of the RSP to retrieve Re using a bi-spectral MODIS approach and a polarimetric approach, which allows for the evaluation of bi-spectral and polarimetric Re retrievals from an airborne perspective using the same samples.

Averaged over all P-3 flight segments examined here for warm clouds, the RSP polarimetric method, the in situ method, and the bias-adjusted MODIS method of Fu et al. (2019) show a comparable median (mean ± standard deviation) for the Re samples of 9.6 (10.2 ± 4.0) µm, 11.0 (13.6 ± 11.3) µm, and 10.4 (10.8 ± 3.8) µm, respectively. These values are far lower than the values of 15.1 (16.2 ± 5.5) µm and 17.2 (17.7 ± 5.7) µm from the bi-spectral retrievals of RSP and MODIS, respectively. Similar results are observed when Re is segregated by cloud-top height and in detailed case studies. The clouds sampled during CAMP2Ex consist of mostly small (mean transect length ∼ 1.4 km) and low clouds (mean cloud-top height ∼ 1 km), which had more numerous small clouds than the trade wind cumuli sampled in past field campaigns such as Rain in Shallow Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) and the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). The overestimates of Re from the RSP bi-spectral technique compared with the polarimetric technique increased as cloud size and cloud optical depth decreased. Drizzle, cloud-top bumpiness, and solar zenith angle, however, are not closely correlated with the overestimate of bi-spectral Re. For shallow clouds that dominated the liquid cloud cover for the CAMP2Ex region and period, we show that 3-D radiative transfer and cloud heterogeneity, particularly for the optically thin and small clouds, appear to be the leading cause of the large positive biases in bi-spectral retrievals. Because this bias varies with the underlying structure of the cloud field, caution continues to be warranted in studies that use bi-spectral Re retrievals in cumulus cloud fields."

However, the potential impacts of climate change on these sectors are rarely considered jointly, especially below national scales, which can mask substantial variability in how communities will be affected. Here, we combine socioeconomic surveys of 3,008 households and intersectoral multi-model simulation outputs to conduct a sub-national analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on fisheries and agriculture in 72 coastal communities across five Indo-Pacific countries (Indonesia, Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, and Tanzania). Our study reveals three key findings: First, overall potential losses to fisheries are higher than potential losses to agriculture. Second, while most locations (> 2/3) will experience potential losses to both fisheries and agriculture simultaneously, climate change mitigation could reduce the proportion of places facing that double burden. Third, potential impacts are more likely in communities with lower socioeconomic status."

To temporarily upgrade the air cleanliness in the Payload Processing Facility, Fueling Hall, and Final Assembly Building Encapsulation Hall, NASA provided two portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) and carbon filter walls that were used in each location. The walls were comprised of stacks of two modules high and arranged in push-push configurations as shown to be most effective via Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of expected floor layouts in each facility. After delivery to NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in 2020, the walls underwent initial verification measurements inside a cleanroom and validation testing in an uncontrolled area to quantify their improvement of air cleanliness and particle and molecular fallout.  Validation testing showed improvements of 83-99% for airborne particle counts, 79-91% for particle fallout, and 50-90% for molecular fallout. The particle improvements were applied to the contamination budget analysis that tracked current and predicted future cleanliness against End-of-Life requirements for JWST’s critical surfaces.

The model was instrumented with steady-state and high-response total pressure probes in the conventional 40-point, equal-area array at the aerodynamic interface plane (AIP). The HSIDT successfully collected high response distortion data points for the X–59 from Mach = 0 to 1.55 for a wide range of angle-of-attack, angle-of-sideslip, and inlet flow. Analyses showed that inlet dynamic distortion and inlet planar wave (or inlet buzz) were within engine limits through most of the flight envelope. The test data showed that inlet planar wave was present at Mach 1.35 and above, at airflows between idle and maximum engine airflow. Engine throttle back will need to be limited when decelerating from supersonic flight Mach to avoid these regions of inlet planar wave. The HSIDT data was also used to compare the metric SUM40, computed from the 40 high-response AIP total pressure probes, with the metric SUM4, computed from four high-response inlet static pressure probes. The data showed that SUM4 can be used as a surrogate for SUM40 during the X–59 flight test to detect inlet planar wave."

Responses to single fires are well documented; however, responses to repeated fires may differ. Fire return intervals, differences among sites, and species may influence responses. We used transect data from four sites on Kennedy Space Center/Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge to test whether growth differed through repeated fires. Two sites burned five times in 36 years, one site burned five times in 25 years, and one burned four times in 18 years. We used linear mixed models that account for repeated measures to determine if the number of fires affected height, total cover ≥ 0.5 m and < 0.5 m, bare ground, and cover of the dominant oak (Quercus) ≥ 0.5 m and of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) ≥ 0.5 m. We compared community composition through repeated fires using nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination.

<strong>Results:</strong> Height, total cover ≥ 0.5 m, and cover of the dominant oak ≥ 0.5 m and of saw palmetto ≥ 0.5 m increased with time since burn; total cover < 0.5 m and bare ground decreased. A quadratic term in the growth model was significant except for total cover < 0.5 m. There were site differences for all variables except bare ground. The number of fires decreased height, total cover ≥ 0.5 m, and cover of the dominant oak ≥ 0.5 and increased total cover < 0.5 m and bare ground but had no effect on cover of Serenoa repens ≥ 0.5 m. Community changes after repeated fires were similar in nonmetric multidimensional ordinations with time since burn correlated to the first or second axis.

<strong>Conclusions:</strong> Scrub recovered from repeated fires at a range of intervals and seasons, but short return intervals reduced growth with responses differing among species."

Examination of the cluster of tidal constituents residing within the M2 tidal group can shed light on the physical mechanisms underlying seasonality. In the broadest terms these are astronomical, frictional–advective interactions, and climate processes; some induce annual modulations and some semiannual, in amplitude, phase, or both. This note reviews how this occurs and gives an example from each broad category. Phase conventions and their relationship with causal mechanisms, as well as nomenclature, are also addressed."

Collagen extracted from animal tissues is a valuable commodity, but suffers from safety and purity issues, limiting its biomaterials applications. Synthetic collagen biomaterials could address these issues, but their construction requires molecular-level control of folding and supramolecular assembly into ordered banded fibers, comparable to those of natural collagens. Here, we show an innovative class of banded fiber-forming synthetic collagens that recapitulate the morphology and some biological properties of natural collagens. The synthetic collagens comprise a functional-driver module that is flanked by adhesive modules that effectively promote their supramolecular assembly. Multiscale simulations support a plausible molecular-level mechanism of supramolecular assembly, allowing precise design of banded fiber morphology. We also experimentally demonstrate that synthetic fibers stimulate osteoblast differentiation at levels comparable to natural collagen. This work thus deepens understanding of collagen biology and disease by providing a ready source of safe, functional biomaterials that bridge the current gap between the simplicity of peptide biophysical models and the complexity of in vivo animal systems."

We report on the width evolution of limb CMEs in SCs 23 and 24 in order to test the suggestion by Gopalswamy et al. that CME flux ropes attain pressure balance at larger heliocentric distances in SC 24. We measure CME width as a function of heliocentric distance for a significantly large number of limb CMEs (∼1000) and determine the distances where the CMEs reach constant width in each cycle. We introduced a new parameter, the transition height (hc) of a CME, defined as the critical heliocentric distance beyond which the CME width stabilizes to a quasi-constant value. Cycle and phase-to-phase comparisons are based on this new parameter. We find that the average value of hc in SC 24 is 62% higher than that in SC 23. SC 24 CMEs attain their peak width at larger distances from the Sun than SC 23 CMEs do. The enhanced transition height in SC 24 is new observational ratification of the anomalous expansion. The anomalous expansion of SC 24 CMEs, which is caused by the weak state of the heliosphere, accounts for the larger heliocentric distance where the pressure balance between CME flux rope and the ambient medium is attained."

We observe X-ray luminosities (0.8–3.0 keV) ranging from log Lx ∼ 27.7–29.1. We find that our Peter Pan sample exhibits X-ray properties similar to that of weak-lined T Tauri stars and do not exhibit evidence of stellar accretion induced X-ray suppression. Our observed Peter Pan X-ray luminosities are consistent with that measured for field dM stars of similar spectral type and age, implying their long primordial disk lifetimes are likely not a consequence of unusually faint X-ray host stars. Our derived X-ray photoevaporative mass-loss rates predict our systems have passed the point of rapid gas dispersal and call into question the impact of this internal mechanism for primordial disk dispersal around dM stars. Our qualitative assessment of the surrounding Peter Pan environments also does not predict unusually low levels of external photoevaporation relative to other respective moving group members. Overall, our results suggest Peter Pan disks may be a consequence of the low far-UV flux incident on the disk in low-mass dM stars given their relatively lower levels of accretion over the course of their pre-main-sequence evolution."

Orbital monitoring of these low-mass objects becomes essential in constraining their fundamental properties, as dynamical masses can be extracted from their Keplerian motion. Here, we present the combined efforts of the AstraLux Large Multiplicity Survey, together with a filler sub-programme from the SpHere INfrared Exoplanet (SHINE) project and previously unpublished data from the FastCam lucky imaging camera at the Nordical Optical Telescope (NOT) and the NaCo instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Building on previous work, we use archival and new astrometric data to constrain orbital parameters for 20 M-type binaries. We identify that eight of the binaries have strong Bayesian probabilities and belong to known young moving groups (YMGs). We provide a first attempt at constraining orbital parameters for 14 of the binaries in our sample, with the remaining six having previously fitted orbits for which we provide additional astrometric data and updated Gaia parallaxes. The substantial orbital information built up here for four of the binaries allows for direct comparison between individual dynamical masses and theoretical masses from stellar evolutionary model isochrones, with an additional three binary systems with tentative individual dynamical mass estimates likely to be improved in the near future. We attained an overall agreement between the dynamical masses and the theoretical masses from the isochrones based on the assumed YMG age of the respective binary pair. The two systems with the best orbital constrains for which we obtained individual dynamical masses, J0728 and J2317, display higher dynamical masses than predicted by evolutionary models."

The history of implementation of the smoothness constraints in the AERONET retrieval algorithm is discussed. It is shown that the latest version of the smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of refractive index, termed standard and employed by Version 3 of the retrieval algorithm, should be modified to account for strong variability of light absorption by brown-carbon-containing aerosols in UV through mid-visible parts of the solar spectrum. In Version 3 strong spectral constraints were imposed at high values of the Ångström exponent (440–870 nm) since black carbon was assumed to be the primary absorber, while the constraints became increasingly relaxed as aerosol exponent deceased to allow for wavelength dependence of absorption for dust aerosols. The new version of the smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of the refractive index assigns different weights to different pairs of wavelengths, which are the same for all values of the Ångström exponent. For example, in the case of four-wavelength input, the weights assigned to short-wavelength pairs (440–675, 675–870 nm) are small so that smoothness constraints do not suppress natural spectral variability of the imaginary part of the refractive index. At longer wavelengths (870–1020 nm), however, the weight is 10 times higher to provide additional constraints on the imaginary part of refractive index retrievals of aerosols with a high Ångström exponent due to low sensitivity to aerosol absorption for longer channels at relatively low aerosol optical depths. The effect of applying the new version of smoothness constraints, termed relaxed, on retrievals of single-scattering albedo is analyzed for case studies of different aerosol types: black- and brown-carbon-containing fine mode aerosols, mineral dust coarse mode aerosols, and urban industrial fine mode aerosol. It is shown that for brown-carbon-containing aerosols employing the relaxed smoothness constraints resulted in significant reduction in retrieved single-scattering albedo and spectral residual errors (compared to standard) at the short wavelengths. For example, biomass burning smoke cases showed a reduction in single-scattering albedo and spectral residual error at 380 nm of ∼ 0.033 and ∼ 17 %, respectively, for the Rexburg site and ∼ 0.04 and ∼ 12.7 % for the Rimrock site, both AERONET sites in Idaho, USA. For a site with very high levels of black-carbon-containing aerosols (Mongu, Zambia), the effect of modification in the smoothness constraints was minor. For mineral dust aerosols at small Ångström exponent values (Mezaira site, UAE), the spectral constraint on the imaginary part of the refractive index was already relaxed in Version 3; therefore the new relaxed constraint results in minimal change. In the case of weakly absorbing urban industrial aerosols at the GSFC site, there are significant changes in retrieved single-scattering albedo using relaxed assumption, especially reductions at longer wavelengths: ∼ 0.016 and ∼ 0.02 at 875 and 1020 nm, respectively, for 440 nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) ∼ 0.3. The modification of smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of the refractive index has a minor effect on retrievals of other aerosol parameters such as the real part of the refractive index and parameters of the aerosol size distribution. The implementation of the relaxed smoothness constraints on the imaginary part of the refractive index in the next version of the AERONET inversion algorithm will produce significant impacts at some sites in short wavelength channels (380 and 440 nm) for some biomass burning smoke cases with significant brown carbon content and possibly in mid-visible channels (500 and 675 nm) to near-infrared channels (870 to 1020 nm) for some urban industrial aerosol types. However, most differences in single-scattering albedo retrievals between those applying the new relaxed constraint and the standard constraint will be within the uncertainty of the single-scattering albedo retrievals, depending on the level of aerosol optical depth, Ångström exponent, brown carbon content and wavelength."

This study presents a new idea for precipitation phase determination using brightness temperatures (TBs) from Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS). It is found that TB-based phase discrimination shows comparable determination performance to that from model outputs over land. In contrast, TB-based phase discrimination over the ocean performs noticeably worse than that from model outputs. Further analyses reveal that the phase determination performance over land from TBs slightly depends on the satellite’s local zenith angle. However, the determination performance over the ocean strongly depends on the satellite’s local zenith angle, with the skill score decreasing sharply from 0.74 near the nadir to 0.55 near the edge. These results imply that over land, TBs may be used directly for phase determination, which can be extended to other operational and future microwave sounders with similar channels available."

All models agree that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen deposition driven gains in carbon stocks are partially offset by climate and land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) losses. However, there is a lack of consensus in the partitioning of the sink between vegetation and soil, where models do not even agree on the direction of change in carbon stocks over the past 60 years. This uncertainty is driven by plant productivity, allocation, and turnover response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (and to a smaller extent to LULCC), and the response of soil to LULCC (and to a lesser extent climate). Overall, differences in turnover explain ~70% of model spread in both vegetation and soil carbon changes. Further analysis of internal plant and soil (individual pools) cycling is needed to reduce uncertainty in the controlling processes behind the global land carbon sink."

Previous studies have used optical satellite imagery to estimate large-scale forest disturbance and resilience patterns. However, satellite images alone cannot provide measurements of vertical mangrove structure. In this study, we used dense point cloud data collected by NASA Goddard’s LiDAR, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-LiHT) airborne imager before (March 2017) and after (December 2017 and March 2020) Hurricane Irma to quantify the recovery, or lack thereof, of the three-dimensional (3D) mangrove forest structure. Recent resilience and vulnerability models developed from Landsat time series following the storm were used to group the lidar data into distinct disturbance-recovery classes. We then analyzed lidar-based forest canopy within each of the recovery classes to test a suite of forest structural characteristics. Our results indicate that 77.0 % of the survey area experienced canopy height loss three months after Hurricane Irma, whereby the majority of canopy height loss occurred in areas with the tallest mangrove forests (i.e., 15–25 m tall). Our analysis shows that the mangrove canopy height in South Florida increased by an average 0.26 m from December 2017 to March 2020, with most of the forest (84.7 % of the survey area) experiencing canopy height regrowth. However, only 38.1 % of the survey area has recovered to pre-storm canopy height. The distribution of canopy height was significantly altered by Hurricane Irma in the low and intermediate resilience classes, but were not significantly different 2.5 years later. Indeed, in areas of low resilience, little to no vertical change has occurred suggesting the absence of canopy regrowth and natural regeneration. Conversely, mangroves in high resilience class, which are dominated by shorter canopies (<5 m), were not heavily damaged by the storm and have maintained the same structural attributes as those before Hurricane Irma. Our findings highlight that hurricane disturbances significantly alter mangrove forest canopy structure, but recovery of vertical structure varies by resilience classes, species composition, and canopy height."

For instance, landers can use computer vision techniques for identifying safe landing locations, aerial vehicles use cameras as navigation sensors, and planetary rovers use them for localization and hazard detection. Engineering simulations of such systems requires the accurate modeling of perception and vision sensors for simulating autonomy scenarios. In addition, the modeling of sensors for landers, aerial and ground vehicles requires the ability to handle large and high-resolution terrains, the accurate modeling of illumination, hi-fidelity rendering via ray/path tracing and the inclusion of sensor characteristics. Vision sensor models strive to simulate sensor reality by using physics principles to model the interaction of light and objects. Furthermore, high frame rate performance is highly desirable for in-the-loop simulations involving vehicle dynamics and control software.

Maintaining and verifying the purity of collected samples and the cleanliness of sample handling hardware throughout the lifecycle of biosignature detection missions like Europa Lander is a primary responsibility of the Contamination Control group at JPL."

This sensor web consists of a set of nodes with a knowledge base, heterogeneous sensors, edge computing, and autonomous decision-making capabilities. Context awareness is defined as the ability for the nodes to gather, exchange, and leverage contextual information (e.g., state of the Earth system, state and capabilities of itself and of other nodes in the network, and how those states relate to the dy- namic mission objectives) to improve decision making and planning. The current goal of the project is to demonstrate proof of concept by comparing the performance of a 3D- CHESS sensor web with that of status quo architectures in the context of a multi-sensor inland hydrologic and ecologic monitoring system."

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has employed the Life Performance Prediction Model (LPPM) to generate predictions and outputs based upon flight data from the rover and experimental data from the thermoelectric (TE) couples. In order to make these predictions, LPPM requires various spacecraft inputs relevant to RTG performance such as fin root temperature, load voltage, general purpose heat source (GPHS) inventory, etc., combined with couple data such as thermoelectric properties, interface degradation, and sublimation properties. With tens of thousands of hours of flight data to date, LPPM can not only track performance to date, but also make predictions on the power output of the MMRTG through the 17-year end-of-design-life (EODL). These predictions are useful for mission planners and surface operators who rely on the MMRTG for power in order to perform the critical science necessary during the mission. This paper will showcase the power data extracted from the flight electronics, comparing it to the predictions and outputs generated from LPPM."

Part of the successful landing was due to the Lander Vision System (LVS), which takes descent images from the LVS Camera (LCAM) and IMU measurements and estimates the lander position relative to a map of the Jezero landing site. The LVS Simulation LCAM (LVSS LCAM) model is an image rendering program developed to test the LVS in a variety of scenarios to ensure performance amid uncertainty. The LVSS LCAM model includes a pointing misalignment model, an exposure timing model, shadowing, a terrain reflectance model, atmospheric attenuation from dust, and sensor effects. This model was used for performance analysis, verification, and validation of the LVS algorithms in a Mars-like simulation prior to landing. This paper describes the LVSS LCAM rendering algorithm and compares flight images from LVS operation during the Perseverance landing with their rendered counterparts."

ASCoT, hosted within the Online NASA Space Estimation Tools (ONSET) on the One NASA Cost Engineering (ONCE) Database, is a web-based tool that provides a suite of estimation tools to support early lifecycle NASA flight software cost analysis. In addition to the traditional parametric flight software costing method COCOMO II, ASCoT contains a Bayesian linear regression to predict total flight software development cost as a function of total spacecraft cost, as well as four analogic methods: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Clustering models to predict Effort (in work-months) and total source lines of code (SLOC). These methods are designed to work primarily with system-level inputs such as mission type (orbiter, lander, etc.), mission destination (Earth, Inner Planetary, etc.), and the number of instruments and deployables. Nonlinear principal components analysis (NLPCA) is performed to find the principal features of the data composed of both categorical and numerical variables and is necessary prior to defining our analogic methods. Sensitivity analyses and in- and out-of-sample model performance results are presented for the Bayesian CER and the analogic models."

While danger is often mitigated bybackups, fallback strategies, and incremental installation withground-in-the-loop cycles which provide a safety net for theinstallation process, the software update described in this paperwas unable to use many of the common practices due to thenature of the fault addressed by the update. The MSL rover(landed August 2012) encountered a problem with one of itscomputer’s non-volatile storage chips in 2019, requiring a swapto its backup computer and an urgent software upgrade calledR-Hope. R-Hope, a lifeboat to be used in the event of primarycomputer issues, was written, tested, and sent to the rover inlightning speed of just 19 months. Multi-mission and teamcoordination allowed the 49 flight software image files to beuplinked to the rover over a 6-week period, using multiple pathsand backup options for speedy delivery. In the end, the RHopesoftware upgrade returned the computer to operation asa backup flight computer.

Both the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) and the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) spacecraft utilize large, precision flight deployable booms to properly position and support their instrument reflectors. The SWOT spacecraft includes two nearly identical reflector booms, each of which have similar flight deployable hinge designs. The NISAR spacecraft has a single reflector boom, with four unique hinge designs. These booms each undergo a multi-staged flight deployment sequence on orbit to transition from the launch stowed configuration to the science configuration within days of launch (Figure 2). The SWOT and NISAR Projects faced significant challenges relevant to requirement verification as well as hardware safety in their approach to ground testing these large flight deployables. This report summarizes flight deployable system design decisions that contributed to ground testing challenges. The report also summarizes the architecture trade study conducted for ground deployment testing. A summary of key issues encountered during flight deployable ground testing with the chosen common gravity offload system ensues, with discussion of the issues and mitigation measures implemented by both Projects that ultimately enabled successful flight subsystem-level full range of motion ground tests. Recommendations and lessons learned are offered to facilitate ground testability of future analogous large scale flight deployables."

ASTER’s visible–near infrared (VNIR) instrument, with three bands and a 15 m Instantaneous field of view (IFOV), is accompanied by an additional VNIR band using a second, backward-looking telescope. Collecting along-track stereo pairs, the geometry produces a base-to-height ratio of 0.6. In 2009, the ASTER Science Team released Version 1 of the global DEM (GDEM) based on stereo correlation of 1.2 million ASTER scenes. The DEM has 1 arc-second latitude and longitude postings (~30 m) and employed cloud masking to avoid cloud-contaminated pixels. The GDEM covers all of the Earth’s land surface from 83 degrees north to 83 degrees south latitude. Version 2 was released in 2011, with notable improvements in coverage and accuracy. In 2019, the final, Version 3, was released; again improving on coverage and removing almost all artifacts. Th GDEM is a unique, global high spatial resolution digital elevation dataset available to all users at no cost. In addition, a second unique dataset was produced and released. The raster-based ASTER Global Water Body Dataset (ASTWBD) identifies the presence of permanent water bodies, and marks them as ocean, lake, or river.

However, the proper application of AI remains a central topic of discussion in many safety-critical fields. This has limited its success in autonomous systems due to the difficulty of ensuring AI algorithms will perform as desired and that users will understand and trust how they operate. In response, there is growing demand for trustability in AI to address both the expectations and concerns regarding its use. The Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace) developed a Framework for Trusted AI (henceforth referred to as the framework) to encourage best practices for the implementation, assessment, and control of AI-based applications. It is generally applicable, being based on terms and definitions that cut across AI domains, and thus is a starting point for practitioners to tailor to their particular application. To help demonstrate how the framework can be tailored into mission assurance guidance for the space domain, Aerospace sought the involvement of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to engage with actual examples of AI-based space autonomy."

The TruePAL system employs an AI and deep learning technology for saving first responders and roadside crews lives in and around active traffic. A deep neural network (DNN) and a Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS) are implemented as an AI system. A mobile app with AI interface is developed to perform verbal communication with the first responders. The TruePAL team has developed an explainable AI approach by opening up the DNN blackbox to extract the activation filters of various features and parts of the targeted objects. The combination of DNN and NARS makes the TruePAL system explainable to the users. TruePAL ingests on-board cameras, radar, and other sensor signals, analyzes the environment and traffic patterns to generate timely warning to drivers and roadside crews to avoid crashes. The TruePAL team, in collaboration with the Miami/Dade Police Dept., has designed five use cases and multiple sub-scenarios in a CARLA driving simulator to test the capability of TruePAL in timely warning to the first responder drivers in potential crash scenarios. We have successfully demonstrated its capability of timely warning in over a dozen scenarios based on the use cases. The preliminary test simulation results show that TruePAL could provide the drivers and crew members advanced warning before a crash occurs."

The drilling operation was halted when the drill feed mechanism unexpectedly stalled shortly after disengaging its magnetically-actuated friction brake at the start of a long move to extend the drill bit into contact with the target rock. The drilling campaign was put on hold and later abandoned as diagnostic experimentation revealed a tendency for the actuator to transition in and out of a high-drag state in which the mechanism could not actuate. In the subsequent months, the team conducted a variety of in-flight and ground-based investigations to determine root cause and identify mitigation strategies for continued operation. Mechanism reliability continued to degrade and by June 2017, it became clear that the mechanism could not be relied upon to support drilling operations. The team succeeded in fully extending the feed, enabling the development of new sampling techniques that would not rely on the feed mechanism. The first feed-extended drilling sample was successfully collected on Sol 2057, 521 sols after the initial feed stall. This paper discusses the anomaly investigation process, failure analysis, and feed mechanism operation mitigation strategies. It concludes with key lessons learned about mechanism design, mission architecture, and operational best practices."

The current international guidelines and NASA policy addressing biological contamination on spacecraft surfaces contains prescriptive guidelines of spore requirements (e.g., 300 spores/m2, 5×105 spores per spacecraft) applicable to spacecraft bound for Mars. To verify these requirements spacecraft engineers sample spacecraft surfaces throughout the assembly, test and launch operations phase of the mission using damp water cotton swabs and polyester wipes. After sampling, the potential biological contamination is enumerated using a series of traditional microbiology techniques to include sonication, heat shocking at 80°C for 15min to select for spores, and growth on tryptic soy agar at 32°C for 72 hours. 

To enable crewed missions to Mars and robotic exploration of the Ocean Worlds a risk informed decision making / performance-based approach to assess biological contamination offers a promising solution in the trade space. Recognizing the need for a performance-based approach, NASA’s new Planetary Protection policies now incorporate the agility for missions to be able to leverage a performance or prescriptive approach. One of top contenders in the option space is a coupled quantitative, descriptive and functional based approach to be able to assess the quantity, types and capabilities of the biological contamination present on spacecraft surfaces. A tailored, mission by mission assurance case could then be formulated by building an argument around the target body, projected capabilities surrounding the types of organisms their potential for survival and proliferation, and ability to be transported on the target body to contaminate an area of biological interest. A performance-based requirement would then be used to demonstrate the mission’s compliance in protecting the planetary environment safety objectives. This symposium talk will showcase the background and need case for NASA to develop such a capability as well as provide an update on the efforts underway in developing a transparent and responsible performance-based approach to biological contamination assessments on spacecraft surfaces."

The evolution of OB stars is greatly influenced by whether the stars begin as close binaries, and the evolution of the binary systems depend on whether the mass transfer is conservative or nonconservative. FUV/NUV spectropolarimetry is poised to answer the latter question. This paper discusses how the Polstar spectropolarimetry mission can characterize the degree of nonconservative mass transfer that occurs at various stages of binary evolution, from the initial mass reversal to the late Algol phase, and quantify its amount. The proposed instrument combines spectroscopic and polarimetric capabilities, where the spectroscopy can resolve Doppler shifts in UV resonance lines with 10 km/s precision, and polarimetry can resolve linear polarization with 10<sup>−3</sup>  precision or better. The spectroscopy will identify absorption by mass streams and other plasmas seen in projection against the stellar disk as a function of orbital phase, as well as scattering from extended splash structures, including jets. The polarimetry tracks the light coming from material not seen against the stellar disk, allowing the geometry of the scattering to be tracked, resolving ambiguities left by the spectroscopy and light-curve information. For example, nonconservative mass streams ejected in the polar direction will produce polarization of the opposite sign from conservative transfer accreting in the orbital plane. Time domain coverage over a range of phases of the binary orbit are well supported by the Polstar observing strategy. Special attention will be given to the epochs of enhanced systemic mass loss that have been identified from IUE observations (pre-mass reversal and tangential gas stream impact). We show how the history of systemic mass and angular momentum loss/gain episodes can be inferred via ensemble evolution through the r–q diagram. Combining the above elements will significantly improve our understanding of the mass transfer process and the amount of mass that can escape from the system, an important channel for changing the final mass and ultimate supernova of a large number of massive stars found in binaries at close enough separation to undergo interaction."

So far, the group has visually surveyed nearly 10 million light curves and authored 69 peer-reviewed papers which mainly focus on exoplanets and discoveries involving multistellar systems. The preferred manual search-method carried out by the VSG has revealed its strength by detecting numerous objects which were overlooked or discarded by automated search programs, uncovering some of the most rare stars in our galaxy, and leading to several serendipitous discoveries of unprecedented astrophysical phenomena. The main purpose of the VSG is to assist in the exploration of our local universe, and we therefore advocate continued crowd-sourced examination of time-domain data sets, and invite other research teams to reach out in order to establish collaborating projects."

To identify realistic scenarios for the emergence of life-like properties, we develop the concept of a seed-dependent autocatalytic system (SDAS), which is a subnetwork that can autocatalytically self-maintain given a flux of food, but cannot be initiated by food alone. Rather, initiation of SDASs requires the transient introduction of chemical “seeds”. We show that, depending on the topological relationship of SDASs in a chemical reaction network, a food-driven system can accrete complexity in a historically contingent manner, governed by rare seeding events. We develop new algorithms for detecting and analyzing SDASs in chemical reaction databases and describe parallels between multi-SDAS networks and biological ecosystems. Applying our algorithms to both an abiotic reaction network and a biochemical one, each driven by a set of simple food chemicals, we detect SDASs that are organized as trophic tiers, of which the higher tier can be seeded by relatively simple chemicals if the lower tier is already activated. This indicates that sequential activation of trophically organized SDASs by seed chemicals that are not much more complex than what already exist could be a mechanism of gradual complexification from relatively simple abiotic reactions to more complex life-like systems. Interestingly, in both reaction networks, higher-tier SDASs include chemicals that might alter emergent features of chemical systems and could serve as early targets of selection. Our analysis provides computational tools for analyzing very large chemical/biochemical reaction networks and suggests new approaches to studying abiogenesis in the lab."

Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to detect landslides, often within days of a triggering event, because it penetrates clouds, operates day and night, and is regularly acquired worldwide. Here we present a SAR backscatter change approach in the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) that uses multi-temporal stacks of freely available data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites to generate landslide density heatmaps for rapid detection. We test our GEE-based approach on multiple recent rainfall- and earthquake-triggered landslide events. Our ability to detect surface change from landslides generally improves with the total number of SAR images acquired before and after a landslide event, by combining data from both ascending and descending satellite acquisition geometries and applying topographic masks to remove flat areas unlikely to experience landslides. Importantly, our GEE approach does not require downloading a large volume of data to a local system or specialized processing software, which allows the broader hazard and landslide community to utilize and advance these state-of-the-art remote sensing data for improved situational awareness of landslide hazards."

Some models invoke curvature radiation, while other models assume synchrotron radiation in the current sheet. We interpret the curved spectrum of the Vela pulsar as seen by H.E.S.S. II (up to ∼100 GeV) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope to be the result of curvature radiation due to primary particles in the pulsar magnetosphere and current sheet. We present phase-resolved spectra and energy-dependent light curves using an extended slot gap and current-sheet model, invoking a step function for the accelerating electric field as motivated by kinetic simulations. We include a refined calculation of the curvature radius of particle trajectories in the lab frame, impacting the particle transport, predicted light curves, and spectra. Our model reproduces the decrease of the flux of the first peak relative to the second one, evolution of the bridge emission, near-constant phase positions of peaks, and narrowing of pulses with increasing energy. We can explain the first of these trends because we find that the curvature radii of the particle trajectories in regions where the second γ-ray light-curve peak originates are systematically larger than those associated with the first peak, implying that the spectral cutoff of the second peak is correspondingly larger. However, an unknown azimuthal dependence of the E field, as well as uncertainty in the precise spatial origin of the GeV emission, precludes a simplistic discrimination of emission mechanisms."

Aerosol speciation (e.g., organic aerosols, black carbon, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, dust or sea salt) is typically determined using in situ instrumentation. Continuous, routine surface network aerosol composition measurements are not uniformly widespread over the globe. Satellites, on the other hand, can provide a maximum coverage of the horizontal and vertical atmosphere but observe aerosol optical properties (and not aerosol speciation) based on remote sensing instrumentation. Combinations of satellite-derived aerosol optical properties can inform on air mass aerosol types (AMTs e.g., clean marine, dust, polluted continental). However, these AMTs are subjectively defined, might often be misclassified and are hard to relate to the critical parameters that need to be refined in models.

In this paper, we derive AMTs that are more directly related to sources and hence to speciation. They are defined, characterized, and derived using simultaneous in situ gas-phase, chemical and optical instruments on the same aircraft during the Study of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds, and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys (SEAC4RS, US, summer of 2013). First, we prescribe well-informed AMTs that display distinct aerosol chemical and optical signatures to act as a training AMT dataset. These in situ observations reduce the errors and ambiguities in the selection of the AMT training dataset. We also investigate the relative skill of various combinations of aerosol optical properties to define AMTs and how much these optical properties can capture dominant aerosol speciation.

We find distinct optical signatures for biomass burning (from agricultural or wildfires), biogenic and dust-influence AMTs. Useful aerosol optical properties to characterize these signatures are the extinction angstrom exponent (EAE), the single scattering albedo, the difference of single scattering albedo in two wavelengths, the absorption coefficient, the absorption angstrom exponent (AAE), and the real part of the refractive index (RRI). We find that all four AMTs studied when prescribed using mostly airborne in situ gas measurements, can be successfully extracted from at least three combinations of airborne in situ aerosol optical properties (e.g., EAE, AAE and RRI) over the US during SEAC4RS. However, we find that the optically based classifications for BB from agricultural fires and polluted dust include a large percentage of misclassifications that limit the usefulness of results relating to those classes. The technique and results presented in this study are suitable to develop a representative, robust and diverse source-based AMT database. This database could then be used for widespread retrievals of AMTs using existing and future remote sensing suborbital instruments/networks. Ultimately, it has the potential to provide a much broader observational aerosol data set to evaluate chemical transport and air quality models than is currently available by direct in situ measurements.

This study illustrates how essential it is to explore existing airborne datasets to bridge chemical and optical signatures of different AMTs, before the implementation of future spaceborne missions (e.g., the next generation of Earth Observing System (EOS) satellites addressing Aerosol, Cloud, Convection and Precipitation (ACCP) designated observables)."

Stresses include operational and environmental exposures to thermal, voltage, current, age/exposure, mechanical, and radiation mechanisms. Therefore, in reliability analysis, it is important to consider the contributions of all of these factors when predicting the failure rates of components. Historically, there has been a reliance on handbook data (e.g., MIL-HDBK-217), but experience has shown that these values and distributions are not representative of actual performance (1,2). Therefore, to make more credible reliability and risk assessments for its missions, NASA must transition to estimating likelihoods of failure based on an item’s reliability/longevity factors (or the physical susceptibilities and strengths impacting the design’s performance) has or will experience, whenever possible. To facilitate this transition a “Handbook on Methodology for Physics of Failure Based Reliability Assessments” has been developed by NASA to assist in applying physics experiences or experiment physics for empirical analysis and conceptualized physics exposures or theoretical physics for deterministic analysis, to develop and aggregate realistic likelihoods of failure leading to more credible forecasts of item performance and longevity. In addition, since it is NASA’s intention that this document continues to evolve based on community lessons learned and the introduction of new assessment methodologies, NASA is encouraging and appreciates the contributions of current and future authors to maintain and enhance this handbook and its supporting case studies."

It is applied to the Ku- and Ka-band measurements of the NASA dual-polarization, dual-frequency Doppler radar (D3R) obtained during the International Collaborative Experiments for PyeongChang 2018 Olympic and Paralympic winter games (ICE-POP 2018) field campaign and incorporates the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS) microwave singles cattering property database for oriented particles. The retrieval uses optimal estimation to solve for several parameters that describe the particle size distribution (PSD), relative 
contribution of pristine, aggregate, and rimed ice species, and the orientation distribution along an entire radial simultaneously. Examination of Jacobian matrices and averaging kernels shows that the dual-wavelength ratio (DWR) measurements provide information regarding the characteristic particle size, and to a lesser extent, the rime fraction and shape parameter of the size distribution, whereas the polarimetric measurements provide information regarding the mass fraction of pristine particles and their characteristic size and orientation distribution. Thus, by combining the dual-frequency and polarimetric measurements, some ambiguities can be resolved that should allow a better determination of the PSD and bulk microphysical properties (e.g., snowfall rate) than can be retrieved from single-frequency polarimetric measurements or dual-frequency, single-polarization measurements.
The D3R ICE-POP retrievals were validated using Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) and Pluvio weighing gauge measurements taken nearby at the May Hills ground site. The PIP measures the snow PSD directly, and its measurements can be used to derived the snowfall rate (volumetric and water equivalent), mean volume-weighted particle size, and effective density, as well as particle aspect ratio and orientation. Four retrieval experiments were performed to evaluate the utility of different measurement combinations: Kuonly, DWR-only, Ku-pol, and All-obs. In terms of correlation,
the volumetric snowfall rate (r D 0:95) and snow water equivalent rate (r D 0:92) were best retrieved by the Ku-pol method, while the DWR-only method had the lowest magnitude bias for these parameters (-31% and -8 %, respectively). The methods that incorporated DWR also had the best correlation to particle size (r D 0:74 and r D 0:71 for DWR-only and All-obs, respectively), although none of the methods retrieved density particularly well (r D 0:43 for Allobs). The ability of the measurements to retrieve mean aspect ratio was also inconclusive, although the polarimetric methods (Ku-pol and All-obs) had reduced biases and mean absolute error (MAE) relative to the Ku-only and DWR-only methods. The significant biases in particle size and snowfall rate appeared to be related to biases in the measured DWR, emphasizing the need for accurate DWR measurements and frequent calibration in future D3R deployments."

phase a several kilometer diameter array of ground-based lasers designed to accelerate interstellar nano-spacecraft to 20% light-speed using laser propulsion. We investigate the geometrical and temporal constraints for the initial case of the target star Proxima b in the Alpha Centauri system using a laser ground site in the southern hemisphere. Based on these constraints, we detail requirements for the mission architecture for an orbiting laser to be used as an optical reference. We then present two orbits that can meet all given requirements and represent a range of engagement times and days between engagements. We also present a range of orbits with periods from 3 to 4 
days and engagement times from 660 to 800 s. If desired, the orbit can be matched to the sidereal day, so each orbit period, the beacon can align with the ground station and the same target star without maneuvers. A discussion of the tradeoff between the Earth-based site latitude, time on engagement, and days between engagements is presented."

However, these initial maps are binary, and do not provide a parameter to estimate the spatial variability in the thickness and volumetric fraction of meltwater stored within the firn pore space. Here, we exploit enhanced-resolution vertical-polarization L-band brightness temperature (T^(B)_(V)) imagery (2015–2019) generated using observations collected over Greenland by NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and a simple two-layer L-band brightness temperature model. We map water-saturated firn layers via a “firn saturation” parameter, and interpret our results together with ice slab and perennial firn aquifer spatial extents, estimates of snow accumulation simulated via the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMOp2.3), and airborne radar surveys collected via NASA’s Operation IceBridge (OIB) campaigns. We find that variable firn saturation parameter values are mapped in lower snow accumulation ice slab areas in western, northern, and northeastern Greenland, where firn is colder and water-saturated firn layers seasonally refreeze as solid-ice. Higher firn saturation parameter values are mapped in higher snow accumulation perennial firn aquifer areas in southeastern, southern, and northwestern Greenland, where firn is near the melting point, and meters-thick water-saturated firn layers exist. Our results have implications for identifying expansive englacial reservoirs that store significant volumes of meltwater in locations that are vulnerable to meltwater-induced hydrofracturing and accelerated outlet glacier flow year-round."

We selected the terrain-matching method to determine the position of laser altimeter profiles within a precisely known surface, represented by a digital elevation model (DEM). We took this classical approach a step further, approximated the DEM by planar surfaces, and calculated the optimal position of the laser profile by minimizing the square sum of the elevation differences between reference DEMs and ICESat-2 profiles. We found the highly accurate DEMs of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (DV), Antarctica, ideal for this research because of their stable landscape and rugged topography. We computed the 3-D shift parameters of 379 different laser altimeter profiles along two reference ground tracks collected within the first two years of the mission. Analyzing these results revealed a total geolocation error (mean +1 σ ) of 4.93 m for version 3 and 4.66 m for version 4 data. These numbers are the averages of the six beams, expressed as mean +1 σ and lie well within the mission requirement of 6.5 m."

The CryoSat-2 Arctic freeboard measurements are produced by the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) and are converted to SIT within FOAM using modelled snow depth. This is the first time along-track observations of SIT have been used in this way, with other centres assimilating gridded and temporally averaged observations. The assimilation leads to improvements in the SIT analysis and forecast fields generated by FOAM, particularly in the Canadian Arctic. Arctic-wide observation-minus-background assimilation statistics for 2015–2017 show improvements of 0.75 m mean difference and 0.41 m root-mean-square difference (RMSD) in the freeze-up period and 0.46 m mean difference and 0.33 m RMSD in the ice break-up period. Validation of the SIT analysis against independent springtime in situ SIT observations from NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) shows improvement in the SIT analysis of 0.61 m mean difference (0.42 m RMSD) compared to a control without SIT assimilation. Similar improvements are seen in the FOAM 5 d SIT forecast. Validation of the SIT assimilation with independent Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project (BGEP) sea ice draft observations does not show an improvement, since the assimilated CryoSat-2 observations compare similarly to the model without assimilation in this region. Comparison with airborne electromagnetic induction (Air-EM) combined measurements of SIT and snow depth shows poorer results for the assimilation compared to the control, despite covering similar locations to the OIB and BGEP datasets. This may be evidence of sampling uncertainty in the matchups with the Air-EM validation dataset, owing to the limited number of observations available over the time period of interest. This may also be evidence of noise in the SIT analysis or uncertainties in the modelled snow depth, in the assimilated SIT observations, or in the data used for validation. The SIT analysis could be improved by upgrading the observation uncertainties used in the assimilation. Despite the lack of CryoSat-2 SIT observations available for assimilation over the summer due to the detrimental effect of melt ponds on retrievals, it is shown that the model is able to retain improvements to the SIT field throughout the summer months due to prior, wintertime SIT assimilation. This also results in regional improvements to the July modelled sea ice concentration (SIC) of 5 % RMSD in the European sector, due to slower melt of the thicker sea ice."

Short-cadence Observations of 4584 Eclipsing Binaries in Sectors 1–26,"In this paper we present a catalog of 4584 eclipsing binaries observed during the first two years (26 sectors) of the TESS survey. We discuss selection criteria for eclipsing binary candidates, detection of hitherto unknown eclipsing systems, determination of the ephemerides, the validation and triage process, and the derivation of heuristic estimates for the ephemerides. Instead of keeping to the widely used discrete classes, we propose a binary star morphology classification based on a dimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, we present statistical properties of the sample, we qualitatively estimate completeness, and we discuss the results. The work presented here is organized and performed within the TESS Eclipsing Binary Working Group, an open group of professional and citizen scientists; we conclude by describing ongoing work and future goals for the group.

FiberForm is the major building block of the thermal protection system (TPS) material Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA), commonly used by NASA. The surface chemistry model consists of detailed surface reaction mechanisms such as adsorption, desorption, and several types of Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) reactions to characterize the oxygen-carbon interactions at the surface. This model provides excellent agreement with the experimental data for oxidation product compositions and corresponding translational energy distributions. Further, an effective oxidation model was constructed that captures the equivalent interaction of oxygen inside the microstructure (including multiple surface collisions) via a modified reactivity for a smooth wall boundary condition. This enables the use of this model directly into Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes and Material Response (MR) codes to accurately simulate the gas–surface interactions within FiberForm without using the detailed micro-structure.

However, this effective model is valid only for the virgin FiberForm. As the TPS material undergoes ablation, the preform carbon burns and turns into char. In addition, PICA is also coated with a protective silicon coating called NuSil for the purpose of mitigating the spread of phenolic dust, and limit contamination during clean room operations. Fig. 1 shows a X-ray microtomography image of a charred NuSil-coated PICA. The NuSil layer introduces species containing silicon into the product mixture. Further, the reactivity of the carbon within the char layer is different from the virgin FiberForm as shown in Fig. 2. Recently a new set of molecular beam experiments were performed on this NuSil-coated TPS material [3] with the same type of oxygen beam used in the previous experiments. Using the latest experimental data, the previously developed effective model will be extended to account for the charred carbon as well as the NuSil coating. Finally, this new effective model with three phases – preform carbon, char, and NuSil; will be compared and validated against the experimental product compositions."
1851,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220004811,2023-08-03,Development of a “Nature Run” for Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) for Snow Mission Development,"Snow is a fundamental component of global and regional water budgets, particularly in mountainous areas and regions downstream that rely on snowmelt for water resources. Land surface models (LSMs) are commonly used to develop spatially distributed estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) and runoff. However, LSMs are limited by uncertainties in model physics and parameters, among other factors. In this study, we describe the use of model calibration tools to improve snow simulations within the Noah-MP LSM as the first step in an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE). Noah-MP is calibrated against the University of Arizona (UA) SWE product over a western Colorado domain. With spatially varying calibrated parameters, we run calibrated and default Noah-MP simulations for water years 2010–20. By evaluating both simulations against the UA dataset, we show that calibration decreases domain averaged temporal RMSE and bias for snow depth from 0.15 to 0.13 m and from −0.036 to −0.0023 m, respectively, and improves the timing of snow ablation. Increased snow simulation performance also improves estimates of model-simulated runoff in four of six study basins, though only one has statistically significant improvement. Spatially distributed Noah-MP snow parameters perform better than default uniform values. We demonstrate that calibrating variables related to snow albedo calculations and rain–snow partitioning, among other processes, is a necessary step for creating a nature run that reasonably approximates true snow conditions for the OSSEs. Additionally, the inclusion of a snowfall scaling term can address biases in precipitation from meteorological forcing datasets, further improving the utility of LSMs for generating reliable spatiotemporal estimates of snow."

These events have been suggested to be caused by particles with diameters larger than 10 μm. Here, we compare the reported event rates to expected dust-impact rates using dynamical meteoroid models for the four most abundant meteoroid/dust populations in the inner solar system. We find that the dust-impact rates predicted by dynamical meteoroid models are not compatible with either the Juno observations in terms of the number of star-tracker events per day, or with the variations of dust flux on Juno's solar panels with time and position in the solar system. For example, the rate of star-tracker events on Juno's antisunward surfaces is the largest during a period in which Juno is expected to experience the peak impact fluxes on the opposite, sunward hemisphere. We also investigate the hypothesis of dust leaving the Martian Hill sphere originating either from the surface of Mars itself or from one of its moons. We do not find such a hypothetical source to be able to reproduce the star-tracker event-rate variations observed by Juno. We conclude that the star-tracker events observed by Juno are unlikely to be the result of instantaneous impacts from the zodiacal cloud."

It includes a novel Sample Caching Subsystem (SCS) which will collect rock cores for possible future return to Earth, as well as an improved mobility system with enhanced autonomous navigation which will enable it to traverse faster and farther than prior rovers. The development of both systems required extensive flight software and flight hardware testing. To support this testing, we developed the Surface System Development Environment (SSDEV) and used it for a wide variety of testing. SSDEV is a bundled subset of M2020 Flight Software which runs on commercially available Linux computers and can be combined with multiple backend options for simulation and hardware control. The SSDEV architecture enabled our teams to perform much more testing of flight software and flight hardware than would have otherwise been possible. As a secondary benefit, the SSDEV-based test campaigns also helped our teams enter the operations phase of the mission with greater readiness of operations products and tools. In this paper, we summarize the motivation for SSDEV, provide an overview of the SSDEV architecture, list several examples of how SSDEV was used, and summarize lessons learned. SSDEV is not a substitute for integrated testing with flight-like avionics, but it enabled substantially more testing than would have otherwise been possible and also provided some unique benefits. We recommend architectures like SSDEV to future projects that need to perform extensive hardware and software testing using a limited set of flight-like avionics."

Two key features of SCS are the ability to collect and process rock and regolith samples for possible future return to Earth and the ability to switch between different types of drill bits for coring rocks, abrading rocks, and collecting regolith. These capabilities are enabled by a Corer mounted on the end of a Robotic Arm and a Bit Carousel mounted on the front of the rover body. Beneath the Bit Carousel, a smaller Sample Handling Arm can insert and remove sample tubes from sampling bits in the carousel. For the Corer to interface with the Bit Carousel so that it can exchange drill bits and hand off rock samples, the Robotic Arm must maneuver the Corer to dock with the Bit Carousel. Docking serves two primary purposes: it precisely aligns the Corer with the hardware inside the Bit Carousel, and it applies enough preload between the Corer and the Bit Carousel to make them stay aligned through the process of bit exchange.The docking assembly consists of four concave alignment cones mounted on a large rotating ring, through the center of which the drill can exchange bits and samples with the Bit Carousel. The coring drill includes four alignment posts which mate with the four cones on the dock. Docking uses an algorithm we call “Force-Corrected Docking”, which means it iteratively reads the force/moments reported by the FTS, performs a small motion to reduce sideload and moments while increasing preload, and repeats until reaching a deadband around the target preload. Because docking is a critical function for SCS, the dock hardware and algorithm have been tested thousands of times over 7 years in various stages of development. The culmination of this work is a reliable docking system which has been demonstrated and used in flight."

To support the complex scientific and mobility needs of the mission, the rover utilizes 33 actuators, three multi-degree-of-freedom force-torque sensors, fifteen single or dual-speed resolvers, two solenoid valves, and twelve contact switches. The control for these actuators and sensors is achieved by several levels of flight software, coordinated between two computers with varying bandwidth control loops. Furthermore, the actuators and sensors were integrated into multiple larger robotic mechanisms that were delivered by different organizations at various points in the Integration and Test (I&T) timeline. All of this created a very complex Verification and Validation (V&V) scenario involving multiple subsystems and teams, several hardware and software testbeds with varying levels of fidelity, and significant systems engineering to ensure the overall I&T schedule could be maintained while ensuring system hardware safety.This paper details the integrated V&V effort across multiple teams and venues to provide full coverage of all necessary functionality, performance, and fault protection. First, it provides an overview of how the V&V campaign was subdivided among teams and venues and provides descriptions of the various hardware configurations used to support the testing. The Mars 2020 implementation of the plan incorporates many of the lessons learned from Mars Science Laboratory’s test campaign, and these value-added modifications are discussed here. Also included in this section is the system-level environmental testing approach used for mechanisms. Second, the paper describes the phased approach used by the teams to support new hardware and software deliveries to testbed and Systems I&T. In this approach the test campaign was built upon higher-level mechanism needs for performance, functionality, and safety at specific times in the campaign. Finally, the paper discusses lessons learned from the V&V campaign that should be applied to future large-scale motion control testing efforts."

The challenge of combating poor air quality is exacerbated by growing urban populations, changing emissions, and a warming climate. While there have been many advances monitoring and modeling of atmospheric composition, reflected in the dramatic increase in archived Earth Observations, there is no single measurement or method that alone can provide an accurate depiction of the entire atmosphere. The rapidly growing collections of observational and modeling data require us to be smarter about what data to include, and how such data is used. In recent years, NASA has invested significantly in advancing the concepts for Analytics Collaborative Framework (ACF) [5] and New Observing Strategies (NOS) [4] to tackle our software infrastructure need for harmonized data management and dynamic acquisition of diverse measurements for on-demand, interactive, multivariate analysis, and access [3]. It is not enough to have a big data, standalone analytics solution; it is critical that we start integrating data from remote sensing, modeling, and in-situ networks in a harmonized manner that enables timely and data-driven decision-making for air quality management.

The Mars 2020 Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) System largely leveraged heritage from the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) EDL System while employing targeted technological advancements. The landing process is autonomously directed by a software behavior implemented in the rover's primary flight computer called the EDL Timeline that assumes control of the vehicle six days before atmospheric entry. In addition to performing the critical function of landing the rover on the Martian surface, the EDL timeline behavior must co-exist in a non-partitioned software and system environment with other high-level functions that accomplish the goals for the rest of the mission. Due to the criticality of EDL, the potential for loss of mission, and a need for complete system autonomy, the standard for how the EDL Timeline interacts with other functions in the system is highly constrained. This paper first walks through the basics of the EDL Timeline mechanics and how the behavior is designed to account for internal system variations and environmental unknowns. It then summarizes the interactions between the EDL timeline and other high-level system behaviors like spacecraft mode transitions and system fault protection, focusing on the complications that arise when passing spacecraft control between executive functions. Although the MSL-inherited EDL System is reliable and capable, targeted updates and a thorough verification and validation program were required for Mars 2020. This paper discusses changes made to close vulnerabilities discovered during both MSL and Mars 2020 development cycles, landing system capability enhancements that were enabling for Mars 2020's mission, and how these updates were integrated with the heritage system. It then describes how both analysis and testing campaigns were utilized to verify and validate all aspects of EDL and system behaviors that run during the six days before landing, as well as the operational workarounds that were needed to address problems found during the development and commissioning process. Finally, this paper imparts lessons learned from Mars 2020 EDL development, implementation, and operations, emphasizing how systems designed to conduct time-critical mission events with low margin of error can be improved in the future."

A large fraction of the Jezero Crater landing site was covered with landing hazards including cliffs, inescapable dune fields and rocks. These hazards were identified or inferred using orbital imagery before launch so that they could be avoided using Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) which was composed of two parts: the Lander Vision System (LVS) and Safe Target Selection (STS). During EDL, the LVS successfully estimated map relative position by fusing landmarks matched between descent imagery and a map of the landing site with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. This position estimate was used by STS to identify the safest target for landing that was also reachable given fuel and other constraints. The EDL system then used the powered descent phase to retarget to this location and land safely. The overall error between the targeted location and actual landing location was 5m which was an order of magnitude less than the 60m touchdown error requirement. This paper will describe the final tests of the LVS before launch, the checkout of the LVS during operations and the LVS performance during EDL."

Science planning has previously been characterized as either predictive or reactive. Predictive science planning is needed when constraints drive science activities to be planned far in advance. For example, a combination of long one-way light time plus high-stakes science decisions drove the Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn to have an extremely predictive planning process. On the other extreme, reactive science planning is needed when constraints drive science activities to be planned based on the results of the previous plan. For example, the Mars Exploration Rover mission interacted with the surface of Mars, and so the planning team needed to know the state of the rover at the end of each planning cycle before starting the next cycle. Operational and resource constraints that require management on intermediate timescales has led to the development of a science planning process between these two extremes. For example, the Mars Science Laboratory is a technically complex rover and has a parallel predictive process that allows the operations team to manage engineering constraints several days in advance while maintaining the reactive tactical planning process similar to that of MER. The Mars 2020 Perseverance rover is a technically complex rover in the MSL style, but has an added layer of science complexity: it is tasked with collecting a returnable cache of scientifically valuable samples of Mars within prime mission. Thus, the science planning process also needs to accommodate high-stakes longer-term science decisions in the style of Cassini. In order to balance the push-pull of these constraints, we have developed a science campaign-focused operational paradigm for Mars 2020 Perseverance that allows for both predictive planning to accommodate technological complexity and high-stakes science decisions as well as reactive planning to accommodate the realities of interacting with the martian surface. This paradigm influenced the design of operational processes and operational tools."

Psyche, like many missions, requires low-cost activity planning and sequence generation that serves as the backbone to overall uplink design. Such tools must be maintainable over long periods of operations, and powerful enough to solve complex issues that deep-space one-off missions encounter. In this paper we introduce cost-effective solutions that leverage inner- and open-source principles to meet a variety of common and novel use cases.The uplink process that was designed to meet these challenges is presented, as well as the data-flow through the high-level architecture of the planning software subsystem. The user-facing planning tools are described, particularly the Science Opportunity Analyzer, the Plan Editor, Psyche’s planning automation in the Blackbird framework, and Psyche Simulation Reports. All these applications are either new or have been substantially revamped to meet Psyche’s concept of operations. In particular, ensuring the entire toolchain can correctly process epoch-relative activities is discussed. Underlying the main applications are a common set of dependencies developed and maintained by a new cross-mission association of planning developers. In this way, Psyche can inherit well-tested functionality which saves effort and ensures its developers can focus on solving domain challenges. Quality control of the applications and libraries is ensured with a code-review and unit-test based novel ‘CM lite’ process. Collaboration with international industry and academia using the open-source modules is already occurring.The planning and scheduling software is designed to maximize operator awareness of the integrated plan at every step of the process and use common interfaces and file formats to easily transfer information. Design choices plus the team’s test-driven development process enables more expansive capabilities compared to the decentralized planning and sequence generation functions typical of Discovery-class orbiters without significant development cost increases. Benefits and drawbacks of Psyche’s approach are discussed, including comparison to other missions and tools where appropriate."

Perseverance combines heritage and cutting-edge flight software and hardware to accomplish crucial mission requirements related to Martian surface sampling. The design, development, and operation of NASA’s large strategic science missions require the ability to communicate spacecraft capabilities to hundreds of engineers across multiple disciplines. The interaction between flight and ground software development, Verification and Validation (V&V), Assembly, Test, and Launch Operations (ATLO), and management each demand quick understanding of unique slices of information for each discipline. This information includes the current capabilities of the flight system as well as future capabilities and their status as they are developed and tested. Despite the fundamental and critical nature of this information, the flight software dictionaries used to track it are a stumbling block for many projects. These dictionaries provide the cornerstone for the interpretation of data sent from the spacecraft, allowing for quick comprehension by engineers on the ground. During both spacecraft development and operations, flight software dictionary management includes significant challenges due to the large number of interfacing systems and the subtle yet distinct needs of each.The engineering of flight software dictionaries for Mars2020 had numerous challenges, most-notably: parallel dictionary development to support simultaneous separate flight software build campaigns for each mission phase (cruise and surface), managing requests for operations-enabling information without perturbing the heritage interface with the rover, and the introduction of new tools by the dictionary stakeholders that forced the dictionary team to innovate and redesign the heritage tool chain. These challenges generated guiding principles for the dictionary development effort: emphasize coding best practices and unit testing in the dictionary code development tool chain, use institutionally provided COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) tools whenever possible, and maintain the heritage flight-ground interface all while advancing operations-enabling information via a loosely coupled interface.Throughout development and operations, the Mars2020 dictionary toolchain included IBM DOORS Next Generation, GitHub, Microsoft Excel, Docker, Jenkins, and a significant custom-built Python codebase. Significant interfaces included JPL’s command and control software, heritage flight software team tools and processes, and the many cloud-based ground tools developed for the mission.This paper will discuss the requirements for the Mars2020 dictionary development, the development team’s response to those requirements, lessons learned throughout the process, steps taken towards automated deliveries and continuous integration of stakeholder inputs, potential toolchain improvements for Mars2020, and key takeaways that could be applied to future missions."

The composition of Psyche is unknown, but the scientific community believes it is composed primarily of iron, nickel, and silicates. The Psyche mission will be the first space mission to study this asteroid in close proximity, and as such, determining the elemental composition of the asteroid is one of the primary objectives of this mission. The spacecraft measures this elemental composition using the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS), which detects cosmic-ray induced gamma rays from Psyche’s surface. In addition to gamma rays from Psyche, the GRS will also detect background gamma rays from spacecraft material nearby the GRS. Because Ni is such a key element for achieving the mission science objectives, a special effort has been made to minimize background gamma rays from Ni, thus maximizing sensitivity to the Ni gamma rays from Psyche. The Psyche mission approached this potential Ni background issue with two methods, locating the GRS away from the spacecraft/source of Ni and setting a threshold requirement against the total Ni mass of the spacecraft. Verifying that the total amount of Ni on the spacecraft is within this threshold is thus a key part of ensuring the GRS can meet its science objectives. Ni alloys are commonly used on spacecraft, but the mass and location of elemental Ni is not typically accounted for. Ni can be found in many materials all over the spacecraft – in fasteners, optical assemblies, magnetic shields, electromagnetic interference (EMI) tape, under gold plating, in connectors, and so on. The task proved further challenging because of the distributed nature of the build of this spacecraft and the use of vendors external to JPL. While the analysis was atypical and source information difficult to cull, the approach described in this paper used tools and data available to the project in some form to achieve this goal. For Psyche, current analysis shows there is margin in meeting the Ni mass requirement. This paper explains the systematic approach used to accurately and precisely record Ni content on the Psyche spacecraft. While this approach was defined for Ni on the Psyche mission, it can be used for any future project with the need to accurately estimate the total mass of a single element or material on a spacecraft."

The Perseverance team defines these parameters as software variables that are configurable, commandable and retrievable from Earth. In 2015, the Mars 2020 project leaders focused on improving systems engineering of parameters based on their experiences from parameter management on previous Mars rovers (Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit, and Pathfinder) and parameter failures of past missions, such as the mission-ending parameter of the Mars Climate Orbiter. The new rigorous development process allowed for efficient certification and effective implementation of the parameters, allowing the rover to approach and land on the red planet (the most challenging phase of the mission) with zero parameter issues. Although successful, the Perseverance team learned many lessons for how to better manage parameters for the continued surface operations of the Mars 2020 mission and future missions. This paper will discuss eight parameter-management topics for the Perseverance Mission. The first is parameter definition: how we define parameters on our mission, where they are physically located on the vehicle, and why we have so many of them. The second topic is the updated parameter flight software module from Curiosity, including details on the 99% reduction in parameter commands, new bulk configuration capabilities, and improved parameter traceability. The third topic is parameter selection for different mission phases; this includes improving and tweaking our preferred parameter settings until they become certification candidates and managing parameter configurations based on test venue throughout the mission life cycle. The fourth topic is our flight certification process; this includes certification of flight values for four different epochs in the mission: Launch, Entry Decent and Landing (EDL) - 6days, Landing + 5 Sols (Martian Days, still on Cruise Flight Software), and once are on Surface Flight Software (FSW). The fifth topic covers in-flight command implementation, along with details on testing, validation, and verification of those commands. In the sixth section, we will explain our use of open-source management tools, including how we used GitHub for version control and management approvals. The seventh topic will describe the ground tools used in operations, including capabilities of the in-house built tool called Parasol. The eighth and final topic will dig into lessons learned for improving parameter management in the future of this mission and others."

As the project proceeds past its Critical Design Review, confidence is being built in the system's ability to achieve mission objectives through the implementation of a rigorous payload verification and validation (V&V) program. As part of this payload V&V program, instrument box-level testing was performed by the payload team to verify select instrument-avionics interface requirements. This testing was performed at JPL using the avionics testbed's Bulk Data Storage Emulator (BDSEM) with visiting instrument Test Models. This paper summarizes the Data Link test campaign involving roughly four days of functional testing per instrument, including planning, testing methods, types of issues found, and the requirement closure process. Detail is also provided on the development, deployment, and validation of a standardized analysis tool used in data reviews. This testing verified requirements related to commanding rates, loss of link, packet format, clock counters, loopback test capability, and SpaceWire jitter and skew margins. Additional risk reduction testing of basic commanding, counter behavior, science data collection and transfer, and interface swapping was also performed. Because the BDSEM venue was not originally designed to be a run for record venue, the process of characterizing venue fidelity and establishing suitability for requirement closure using data collected in this venue will also be addressed.In order to close requirements, an extensible tool was developed to post-process instrument command and telemetry data from their original binary to a human-readable format and give visibility to errors detected within the data, such as packets with Cyclic Redundancy Check errors. This tool, called payload-packet-parser, is a Python 3.9 command line tool built using a variety of open-source Python libraries. Payload-packet-parser was designed to support parsing command and telemetry packets for all Europa Clipper instruments and additional analysis tools were developed for verification of specific information interface requirements. This test campaign, including post-processing using a single parsing and verification toolset, allowed for early interface testing, alleviating testing burdens on instrument teams and buying down risk on the instrument-avionics interface by finding hardware and software issues and idiosyncrasies prior to integration with system test venues. Over twenty issues were discovered across the payload, resulting in software updates and instrument rework well in advance of any system impacts. This paper concludes with an assessment of benefits and costs of this type of testing and lessons learned."

While scientifically exciting, the prospect of a (much) larger mission suite raises significant challenges for the current approach to ground stations and mission operations. We have been investigating an integrated approach for ground stations and missions operations to enable new modes of operation while maintaining the capabilities of the current operational techniques. This integrated approach is built around three core capabilities: (1) A queuing antenna that enables monitoring the status of a much larger number of spacecraft, and allows spacecraft to transmit requests for telemetry with NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN); (2) a flexible scheduling system that expands the current DSN scheduling services to enable allocating time on DSN antennas in near real-time; and (3) a cloud-based ground data system that can be spun up and down according to how tracks are assigned by the flexible scheduling system. We shall show that an 18 meter DSN queuing antenna equipped with cyrogenic receivers would enable use of the DSN Demand Access Service for small spacecraft throughout the inner Solar System, thus providing service to a large mission suite. We first discuss the architecture of the queuing antenna and its supporting systems, including, for instance, the service required to generate the schedule for the queueing antenna (which dictates how it slews to monitor multiple spacecraft in a day of operations). Next, we describe the signaling scheme used to encode a request, which is inherited from the already operational DSN Beacon Tone Service, and describe two alternative ways to detect the incoming tone at the ground station, one based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and another one based on Fast-Fourier Transfer (FFT) processing. We then use these results to estimate the maximum range at which a request can be reliably detected as a function of the spacecraft and ground station communication capabilities. Finally, the last part of this part of this paper briefly describes the prototyping effort undertaken at Morehead State University (MSU) and JPL to demonstrate the viability of this new DSN demand access. In particular, we describe the suite of tests conducted using MSU’s 21 meter ground station to validate its use a queuing antenna."

At the end of each drive, a “ground-in-the-loop” (GITL) interaction is used to get a position update from human operators in a more global reference frame, such as a map frame defined by orbital reconnaissance imaging of a large region around the rover’s current position. For Mars rovers, this typically has involved downlinking imagery from the rover mast cameras and using interactive visualization tools on Earth to register such images to the orbital reconnaissance images. For safety purposes, rover mission operations typically specify “keep out zones”, which human operators recognize as being unsafe in the orbital images. Autonomous rover drives are limited in distance so that accumulated relative navigation error does not risk the possibility of the rover driving into a keep out zone. The allowable autonomous drive distance in this mode of operation depends on the distribution of keep out zones and the accuracy of relative navigation; in practice, drive limits of a few hundred meters between GITL cycles are to be expected.  Several rover mission concepts have recently been studied that require much longer drives between GITL cycles, particularly for the Moon. This includes lunar rover mission concepts that involve (1) driving mostly in sunlight at low latitudes, (2) driving in permanently shadowed regions near the south pole, and (3) a mixture of day and night driving in mid-latitudes. These concepts include total traverse distance requirements of up to 1,800 km in 4 Earth years, with individual drives of several kilometers between stops for downlink. These concepts require greater autonomy to minimize GITL cycles to enable such large range; onboard global localization is a key element of such autonomy. Multiple techniques have been studied in the past for onboard rover global localization, including radio navigation aiding from an orbiter, recognizing horizon landmarks that are known in a regional elevation map, and correlating a local elevation map created onboard the rover with a regional elevation map.  These techniques all have drawbacks, including requiring an expensive extra mission element (navigation orbiter), unavailability of sufficient regional elevation map data, or limited accuracy in resulting position estimates (e.g. a few hundred meters with horizon landmarks). For the Moon, the ubiquitous craters offer another possibility, which involves mapping craters from orbit, then recognizing crater landmarks with cameras and/or a lidar onboard the rover. This approach is applicable everywhere on the Moon, does not require high resolution stereo imaging from orbit as some other approaches do, and has potential to enable position knowledge with order of 10 m accuracy at all times. This paper will provide more detail on our technical approach to crater-based lunar rover localization and will present initial results on crater detection using 3-D point cloud data from onboard lidar or stereo cameras and using shading cues in monocular onboard imagery."

Previous statistical studies have identified the solar wind conditions (high solar wind speed and high Mach number, etc.) that favor their generation. However, backstreaming foreshock ions are expected to most directly control how HFAs and FBs form, whereas the solar wind may partake in the formation process indirectly by determining foreshock ion properties. Using Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms mission, we perform a statistical study of foreshock ion properties around 275 HFAs and FBs. We show that foreshock ions with a high foreshock-to-solar wind density ratio (>∼3%), high kinetic energy (>∼600 eV), large ratio of kinetic energy to thermal energy (>∼0.1), and large ratio of perpendicular temperature to parallel temperature (>∼1.4) favor HFA and FB formation. We also examine how these properties are related to solar wind conditions: high solar wind speed and oblique bow shock (angle between the interplanetary magnetic field and the bow shock normal 𝜃Bn∼45°) favor high kinetic energy of foreshock ions; foreshock ions have large ratio of kinetic energy to thermal energy at large 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴Bn (>30°); small 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴Bn (<30°), high Mach number, and closeness to the bow shock favor a high foreshock-to-solar wind density ratio. Our results provide further understanding of HFA and FB formation."
